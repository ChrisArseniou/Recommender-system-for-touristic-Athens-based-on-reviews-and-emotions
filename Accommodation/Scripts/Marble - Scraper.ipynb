They are super helpful and give great recommendations for where to eat out more locally as well as directions on how to get around. The rooms are extremely clean, the beds are comfortable and some rooms have a terrace. We stayed for a few days and then came back and used this hotel as a transition between two other trips around Greece. One of our stays we had a shared bath rather than private and we were impressed with the cleanliness of those as well. I highly recommend this hotel!\n",

The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated.Air conditioning was available with large ceiling fans to keep you cool at night. Reception staff were extremely helpful and advised on places to visit restaurants and bars. The Hotel is close to the underground station and definately worth a visit.\n",

      "Review is :Marble House first appealed to me due to it being located on the less touristy side of the Acropolis. The location is absolutely perfect on a quiet road just around the corner from authentically Greek family run restaurants and bakeries. It's also only a short 10 minute walk up to the Acropolis museum and the majority of main sites in Athens making it a perfect base for exploring.   The staff were all very friendly and provided excellent detailed information on how to get from the airport to the hotel via the metro. The rooms had everything you could need and were kept very clean by the staff. The only thing to note is that there is an additional charge applied for using the air conditioning if you need it.  If you want to stay in an area away from the typical tourist hustle and bustle then I can't recommend Marble Hotel enough. When I'm next in Athens I'll definitely be staying here again without any hesitation.…\n",

First, we'd stayed there before, and I felt at home in the neighborhood, which is tucked away in a narrow side drive a block long. It's like living in Athens. Everyone else is a resident, and the ambience is relaxed, unpretentious and, to my mind, more interesting than observing tourist cafes and shops. Beside, all that is a block or two away, though not  in the profusion of the Plaka. Koukaki is more down home and younger, with a euro beat, though not in the disco sense. Just people being people. relaxed, not simmering to unloose a flood of dollars in local shops. What I like about Marble House and why we go back is this live-to-enjoy-life ambience. Hey,…\n",

All toiletries provided. 20 minutes away (walking) from all highlights in Athens so you are away from noise and crowd but still close enough. The receptionists were informative, not chatty but helpful and discrete, I'd say. The price is amazing and I can't think of a single complaint about this place.

We stayed for three nights in Room 2 on the ground floor. The room was small but adequate, and best described as quirky. It had a small inside “courtyard” (for smokers??) and a small bathroom, with a shower over a tiny bath tub.  The staff were all friendly and helpful, but my main gripe is that there is no food or drink whatsoever at the hotel, so at least take some bottled water. Plenty of inexpensive eateries just down the road however.  All in all, a most enjoyable stay in an excellent and central location, with very good value for money.\n",

      "Review is :I first stayed at Marble House in 1991!  This was my 4th visit, and I'll go back again.  It's a short walk to the Acropolis entrance, and the Syggrou metro station is a 5 min walk.  There are breakfast places nearby along Syggrou, and it's 3 blocks to the restaurant strip along Georgios Olimpiou.  It's at the end of a dead end street, so there's no traffic noise.  We stayed in the apartment, which has a separate entrance and patio, and a small kitchen.  It has a big bed in its own room plus two fold-outs in the living room; it can sleep 5, but with both fold-outs open there's not much space to move around.  Christos and his family are very friendly and helpful.\n",

Location is brilliant - 15 min slow walk to the Acropolis or the Panatheinaic Stadium. The hotel is based in a traditional, authentic residential area - you're far away from the expensive, touristic part of Athens, yet you're still in the city centre.

We were in a four-bed-room with a little balcony: the room war very clean and charming. The fact that the bathroom was outside was no problem at all. The staff of marble house is very kind and the hotel's atmosphere in general is very pleasant. What you get for the low prices of this hotel is just outstanding. Andrea, Nicola, and Helmuth\n",

The rooms themselves are comfortable, very clean and stylish. They come with a fridge and almost all of them have a balcony or patio. If you like marble and the feel of being in Athens, this is the place for you!  It is located at the end of a short cul-du-sac in a residential neighbourhood near the Acropolis. You probably won't find a quieter location in central Athens and yet are only a 10 minute walk to the main attractions. It is also located midway between two pedestrian streets packed with restaurants and the like that are very popular with Athenians.\n",

Very good heating, cooling and overall space. Very quiet as it located at the end of a dead end street  The apartment has NO kitchen basics at all. Salt was the only item provided and we even had to ask for that .... when I asked for some pepper for the empty shaker, I was directed to the supermarket to purchase if I wanted some!! No toaster for bread, no carving/ bread knives for preparing food or even a cutting board. No kitchen table .... you need to have a plate on your lap when eating. Overall.... a show case kitchen facility not meant to used.\n",

They offered great advice and went out of their way to help. The location is perfect - 10 minutes from the Acropolis and in an area that felt really safe (I'm female travelling alone so this part was really important). The hotel is down a cul-de-sac road so really quiet at night too. The rooms were cleaned daily to a very high standard and looked just as beautiful as the website photos. I'm looking forward to returning to Athens one day and Marble House will definitely be my first choice.\n",

While we were there another guest arrived without the instructions and he had trouble getting in (his flight was delayed, the instructions were on his phone and he couldn't access them). If you will use the Metro to get around and aren't used to high levels of organized pick-pocketing, do some research about this before you arrive in Athens.

The problem is, their website doesn't have a secure method of submission.  They want you to give them your credit card number in an email, and the vast majority of email accounts are unsecured.  This aside, once you book with them and give them your credit card info, they try the card once immediately and once again before your stay at a random time.  If either attempt fails, they cancel your reservation.  I pre-authorized my credit card to work in Greece three months before my trip, specifically to adhere to this hotel's policies.

      "Review is :Eleven years ago I discovered the Marble House through a good friend. My friend and I had the most incredible time in Athens due to the unprecedented enthusiasm of Nancy to make our trip the very best experience possible.  This trip was no exception, and I made it even more challenging for the Marble House.....I brought my whole family with me and my daughters friend. We were a total of six purposely unorganized yet adventurous travelers looking to be overwhelmed with Athens, and the Marble House came through. This trip, I was greeted by Nancy's son Christos, who has apparently taken the leadership position and put the Marble House on a whole other level. The renovations to the rooms of the hotel, since I last visited, were absolutely perfect as they brought in a more modern…\n",

If I were just basing this review off of the rooms then I would no doubt recommend it. The customer service was quite another thing, however.  First, there is no lift in this hotel and while I have no problem with stairs, none of the employees offered to help carry my bags up to the third floor. As I had been traveling in Europe for a while and had two suitcases, I certainly could have used the help.   Second, when we got to the room we were confused on how to turn on the A/C (We were there in the middle of a 104/42 degree heatwave). I went downstairs to ask how to activate the A/C and was informed that I had to pay by the day for this. As I had not read this in…\n",

We stayed at the hotel on three occasions over the course of a month, 11 nights in all, and so experienced three different types of accommodation.

The staff are extremely helpful – explaining in detail attractions nearby, recommending reputable local places to eat (Note: you MUST try “2 dekares i oka” (ask the hotel, they will give you directions) – it’s AMAZING – delicious food, huge portions and very reasonably priced!), and assisting with booking a taxi for our early morning…\n",

It appears there are other rooms sharing toilet and showers and so it sometimes gets a little busy and noisy in  the rooms close to the facilities. The hotel offers no breakfast but there are restaurants, bars, and cafés in the area. One restaurant is open from early morning until late night and is on the main street one block down from the hotel.

Location is good if you look at it from the angle of being in a quiet cul-de-sac in a residential area, though the area has nothing pretty at all. But it is far away from the tourist attractions. You'd have to take the metro, or a long walk only if the weather is cool.

Some of the rooms have lovely balconies that look out on the street. I would just warn travelers that although they can hold luggage during the day, they are not equipped to stow luggage overnight, so if you are taking an overnight trip to Delphi as we did, you will need to take your luggage with you.

As the name suggests, floors and stairs of marble. Really well kept and spotlessly clean. Had a lovely room with a little balcony. Great location about 15 minute walk to acropolis. Desk staff were friendly and knowledgeable.  Would love to stay again!\n",

Very neat and clean rooms - not very large in size though. Rooms were cutely furnished. Kristos and his family are helpful hosts. You will need to pay 5Euros extra for the AC, which was required in Sept, though the room had a fan. There is no lift. Some rooms had shared bathroom, though ours had a balcony with dedicated bathroom. Location is 5-10 mins by car from Acropolis, Plaka (shopping district) in a safe neighbourhood with a handful of restaurants and dept. stores right outside. Had a most amazing dinner at a recommended restaurant 2 mins. from the hotel. For the price, it is definitely recommended.\n",

They have rooms on the thrid floor, with no lifts, so if travelling with elderly or babies, try to get a room on the first floor!

It is close to a metro station from which you have access to all major touristic sites. At the same station is also a tram station that will bring you to the beach in like half an hour. So during a stay at the hotel you can explore the city and also hang out at the beach. Also our hotel room had a big balconz that was perfect to sit in the evening. The best thing about the hotel was the great service and help we received. They recommended how to get around and what to see. We really enjoyed ourselves and felt very welcomed!\n",

We found it to be incredibly noisy in the mornings and weren't able to sleep past 9am with the sound of other guests eating their breakfast in the lobby. Since it is a family-run hotel, the front desk closes quite early and the front doors become locked, so if you are checking in particularly early or late this could be a problem.\n",

It is also close to the Athens Museum and Plaka. Excellent value for money- would certainly stay here again\n",

You can buy breakfast but it isnot satisfying and not sufficient for the price paid. There are restaurants  supermarkets and bakeries close to the hotel. Reception works until 9.00 pm which is an obstacle since you might be back after 9 and might need something. (Considering that Athens is a lively city you might wanna hang out of the hotel)  The lady at the reception might reject some of your requests since it is past 9pm.  Rooms are a bit small at night rooms might become a bit airless but this never was a problem for us since there was ventilator.\n",

Despite being small there is enough room to unpack and spread out. It was one of the few places I stayed in where the mini fridge actually worked well! Be aware rooms with shared bath facilities do not have their own basins.The atmosphere of the hotel is friendly and appealing, with greenery and simple marble decor. I loved the fact that it was small and personal, versus an enormous hotel churning bunches of tourist through.Wonderfully quiet; awoke to birds chirruping even though located in such a busy area. Fabulous proximity to major sites; was promptly provided with a map to navigate the area.\n",

It may feel a bit cramped for people who are 6 feet or taller, but it worked out fine for us. Clean bathroom, free wifi and large furnished balcony to stretch your legs after a long day of sightseeing or drying your hand washed laundry. Breakfast is extra and they only provide complimentary toiletries for the first night. The hotel is not in the middle of everything, BUT it's quite close to most attractions in historic Athens. It is located at the end of a residential alley, 6/7 minutes walk from the nearest metro station (Sigrou-Fix), which is one stop away from most attractions. We were able to walk to Plaka and Acropolis area in 10-12 minutes.…\n",

The hotel is located 10 minutes away from the centre of Acropolis with many small cafes and sandwich shops on every corner!! After staying out late many nights we both felt extremely safe and secure in the area we were based! The room itself was clean and comfortable, however, the only fault we could say is that the shower does flood the bathroom floor on each use as the curtain doesn't stop the water flow!! Overall we both were very pleased at this lovely hotel and would most definitely stay again for a cost cheap stay!!\n",

It offers an affordable continental breakfast but if you prefer something else there are many cafe's five minutes away. It is excellent value for money. The management, Christos, Nancy and staff Nikos were very welcoming, accommodating, helpful and very friendly. Anna and Suzanna made sure we had fresh white towels and sheets and kept the hotel spotless and always with a cheery smile.

Within a couple of blocks there is a nice pedestrian boulevard, grocery stores, a drugstore, coffee shops and more.  The money you save can be used to take cabs to the tourist sites.  A note on the cabs - like all big cities some will try to pad the fee.  Google maps works great there.  I suggest showing the cabs the route to take.  If they say they want a flat fee, it is probably high.  Negotiate down or just accept since it is still reasonable compared to USA prices.\n",

Room was perfect for me as I was traveling alone and I adore Bed and Breakfast style hotels. The location was perfect. Only a 15 minute walk to all the ancient attractions.  Also enjoyed the best mug of tea I had in Greece. Will definitely stay at Marble House in two summers when I return.  Many thanks to Nancy, her son and Nicholas.  Wonderful!\n",

It was extremely quiet at night, making it hard to believe you were nestled in the middle of a big city. Just a short walk and you are at the Parthanon. Make sure you take in the views of the Parthanon at night, it is spectacular! The room was very small in North American standards, but comfortable enough to sleep. The bathroom was modern, but also very small. Air conditioning is 5 Euros extra, but well worth the money. The bed was comfortable.

The restaurants are amazing, and Christos (a second-generation hotelier in a 3rd-generation building) is a thoughtful, gracious host!!!  You may have to carry a suitcase a flight or two up, and the rooms are small, but the level of comfort is immense -- as is the value.

This small hotel which is renovated regularly has the feel of an authentic Greek island pension that has been dropped into bustling Athens.  It is small (though, to Australians most everything in Europe is small) but the high standard of cleanliness (the rooms and bathrooms are spotless) far out-ways this.  Located in a quiet residential street just off the main road, it’s in close proximity to all the historical attractions, the Plaka, public transport (metro, tram and bus) and a great bakery around the corner for breakfast.  The hotel provided map lists all the places you would want to go to, shows the closest metro station to that place and also has a metro map. …\n",

Friendly and hospitable family run guest house.  Note: bathrooms are shared. The room was basic but clean and everything we needed.  Our room had a balcony overlooking the tiny street - beautiful and peaceful to sit underneath the shady tree.  The owner was only too happy to help and advise on great eating places and how to get to all the sights.  Great value for money.   Would stay here again if we go back to Athens.\n",

The location was perfect - close enough to the tourist attractions, yet far enough away to be quiet and peaceful.  As a single woman I felt perfectly safe walking alone in the neighbourhood at night and was able to walk to all the places that I wanted to visit.  Nancy and Christos were charming and helpful with all and any questions.   The room was perfect and the terrace divine.  I would never stay anywhere else in Athens.

It took 10 to 15 minutes or so walk to the Acropolis, museums, and the old city. The hotel is on a small, dead end street, so it was quiet. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the front of the hotel, which was comfortable and pleasant to sit on. The hotel is clean and comfortable. One of the best things is that Nancy, one of the owners of this family-owned hotel, was extremely helpful getting our bearings, answering all our questions, and giving suggestions. The hotel had their own map of Athens, which was better than any I had or had access to. Nancy was friendly, interesting, and fun to talk with. We highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Problems / Issues  - Iron frame bed was very creaky. Every time someone rolled over in the night, we both woke up.  - Fan was also pretty noisy. Overall sleep quality wasn't great.\n",

All the facilities were great: a comfortable bed, enough space and it was extremely clean!!  We really appreciate Nancy' tips, she always suggested us good places where to have dinner!  We will definitively recommend this hotel to our friends, and we sincerely hope to see back in future, thanks a lot!! Best wishes, Letizia and Olivier from London.\n",

When we walked into the room on the third floor, we were a little taken aback, as it was not very big at all, but then we opened the door onto the spacious balcony/terrace overlooking the quiet, dead-end, residential street on which the hotel is located, into the beautiful trees, and were very pleased. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the bathroom was gorgeous, having been renovated just this winter, and though it was tiny, as most travellers of Europe know this is typical. There was a safe, and a small bar fridge where we kept water and perishable foods during our stay. We really enjoyed the patio table and chairs during the afternoon when we returned from all of the attractions we were able to walk to…\n",

When there were no rooms that we were asking for by email, we got a different kind of offer, that we ended up prefering to our first idea. The staying was very pleasant and the shared bathroom was very clean. And I personally loved the location and atmosphere of the place. Even the reastaurant recommendation was great! The wifi worked very nicely also. Whenever we asked for help, we got it. The only problem was with the national day: on our arrival we were told that the metros would run normally, but on the departure day we were told that certain stations could be closed. Well, we ended up taking a taxi, though we did also get directions for the bus. All was well in the end!\n",

It is ideally situated as we were able to go by foot to the new Acropolis Museum (10 mn walk), and find a typical greek restaurant in the streets nearby. At the hotel we have been warmly welcomed by Christos, who is a very kind and very helpful person, always ready to give you the information you just need.

We stayed in 3 different hotel rooms over a 10 day period while exploring other cities in Greece. All 3 rooms were very different in terms of aesthetics and size. Water pressure for showers was best in the room on the 2nd floor. The air conditioner did not work in any of the rooms we stayed in, which was unfortunate.

Another big plus was the convenient location to the metro, which made our onward journey to Piraeus very easy.  Would definitely recommend if your expectations are not too high.\n",

      "Review is :Marble House is a fantastic budget option that is minutes away from the touristic heart of Athens. You don't travel to spend extensive time in your hotel; so, whilst basic, this certainly is an ideal option within walking distance of Plaka and the Acropolis.  The rooms are simple with little more than a bed and a fridge, but the quiet neighborhood ensures you sleep soundly and that's all you really need. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the lack of 24 hour reception doesn't matter given 24 hour access with the key or code.\n",

      "Review is :I stayed only one night at the Marble House hotel in Athens. It is a small hotel in a quiet cul-de-sac within walking distance of the Acropolis and also of Plaka, the old area of Athens. The hotel is indeed basic, but for a budget traveller it is ideal. You get to keep the hotel key with you so you need no night concierge. The rooms are small and have just the basic features you need from a hotel: a bed, a closet, a bathroom with a (working!) shower, plus a ceiling fan and air conditioning, which is indispensable in Athens. The hotel is also well connected by transit and has a metro station nearby (Sygrou-Fix). One can choose to have breakfast at the hotel, which is some instant coffee, some juice and some toast with butter and jam, nothing glamorous, but it may be convenient if…\n",

Family run, with helpful and knowledgeable staff. Rooms were clean and welcoming, but sure you ask for air conditioning. It's an added cost but it gets too hot in the summer without it.

The owners are very helpful and friendly and the guest is made very pleasantly aware that he/she is staying in a family-run hotel.   Because the hotel is not in Plaka, one can enjoy the Acropolis and the surrounding festive spirit of Plaka and then at the end of the day or night, retire from the hubbub in the tranquil neighborhood of Marble House.  A very positive feature of this hotel is the lack of television, and consequently the lack of noise from your neighbor's television set.\n",

Marble House served the scope and within this respect it was a perfect compromise. It sits at the end of a closed side street (so it was quite); the area itself is not compelling, just regular residential but it’s at walking distance from the Acropoli and Plaka. The metro stop (Sigrou-Fix) is 5 minutes walking away.  I booked through email/phone and received a confirmation along with detailed description about how to reach the hotel. Upon arrival I was given the main info and the key of my room. The room was on the third floor and it was of adequate size.

The hotel is spotless and welcoming and I really felt like I was part of the family unlike some of the larger hotels. They really went out of their way to accommodate me even when my travel plans changed.

He even helped us with directions to the train station, and told us when to leave in order to arrive at the station on time.  When we returned after two weeks, he wanted to hear about all the places we had been, what we had seen and done, and what we liked and disliked about Greece.

There is also a brilliant traditional restaurant serving homemade Greek food just around the corner in Zinni Street, and a 24 hour cafe ( scrummy baklava) in Syngrou Avenue. Christos could not have been more helpful, giving us maps, advice, making phone calls for us and allowing us to print our return flight boarding passes. The rooms were small, but immaculately clean, we had a fridge in the room and there was lots of hot water. For those wanting a budget stay, in the heart of Athens, we would wholeheartedly reccommend the Marble House Hotel.\n",

I would say that this hotel is fine given the price we paid (45 euros per night) but the accommodations are very basic.  What we liked:  The location which is close to the Plaka, public transport and yet situated in a quiet area.  The in-room WiFi.    What we appreciated least:  Our first floor room was really small with a tiny unfurnished balcony overlooking a messy interior court yard.  The bathroom was equally tiny and both mornings when we wanted to shower, there was no hot water.    Our treatment from Christos and staff was kind and polite but paled in comparison to the warmth and generosity we experienced from the various other hotel owners/inn keepers we dealt with during our 3 weeks in Greece. …\n",

It is a five minute walk from the metro and 10-15 minutes from the Acropolis.  If you are trying to save money, I would recommend the Marble House, however, if you are looking for a romantic hotel I would not recommend it.  I booked a double room for my husband and myself, but it had two twin beds that were on opposite sides of the room.  Additionally, the private bathroom was not attached to the room.

The location definitely can’t be beaten as it’s privileged being inside a small calm street. Christos and his parents were very helpful and attentive for any kind of question and advise. This is an additional benefit if you book a family-run hotel.  Room were clean and seemed recently renovated, great value for money.  At the beginning of our visit in Greece it was extremely important for us the WiFi connection and to be honest Marble House had the fastest Internet connection we experienced in comparison to other properties.   With no second thought we will stay at Marble House next time in Athens……\n",

Christos, the owner, told us that bathrooms have been remodeled last year at the same classic style of the hotel. And that’s true; they have done a nice job.  We aslo met the rest of the family who were excellent hosts and helpful with almost anything we requested.  For such a good bargain (40 Euro for a double room with balcony overlooking the quite street above) is the best deal in town, especially if you consider that besides the walking proximity of major sites the neighborhood is very quite and safe!

It's clean and simple, definitely no frills, but that's all a budget traveler could ask for. A MAJOR advantage is its coule-de-sac location, which means lots of quiet and a very good night's sleep. I kept the window open at night and slept very well. That, together with the fan, made AC seem rather unnecessary. The shared bathroom was always clean. I paid 40 euros (had to go for a double room because the single was taken by the time I had reserved) and felt I got my money's worth. The area is very nice - just the right mixture and with a genuine Athenian feel to it. Very safe. Did not have the breakfast so cannot attest to that. I'd go back for certain.\n",

We had a little patio, fridge, wlan, and aircon.The location is perfect for visitors looking for a quiet place near Acropolis, Plaka and city center. The area is safe and only 10m Minutes walk away of the Plaka with it`s restaurants, bars and shops.  We had two lovely days and comfortable nights at the Marble House and would check in again at any time ! Nancy gave us usefull tips for dinner and for the early transfer to the ferries in Priaeus. She organised our Taxi for our very early start in the morning.  Thank you, Nancy and Christos !  Jan & Catalina from Hamburg / Germany\n",

Be prepared to carry your luggage up the stairs.  If you only need a place to crash after a long day of sight seeing and touring, this is a a good, clean place to do it.  It's within walking distance to nearly everything, very close to the Plaka and Temple of Zeus and Syntagma Square.  The owner was very helpful in providing information on things to do and the best way to see them and do them.  He also made sure to reserve us a taxi for our ferry transfer at the end of our stay there to make sure we arrived on time.  The cab driver was slightly early and the process couldn't have been easier.\n",

It is very easy to get to the Parthenon, but what was really nice was the surrounding Athens neighborhood that you walk to get to the sights. The area is full of grocery stores, post office, pool halls and cafes. A welcome surprise. The metro stop is easy to get to also. The hotel is clean and very good value. We had one of the shared bathrooms and it was fine. The ceiling fans are good if you get one of the non-a/c rooms although it doesn't cool off in the rooms until around 10pm. We liked it so much, we booked our rooms for the end of August when we left. Christos was also very helpful with dinner suggestions. A good, well priced hotel.\n",

Bathroom door was an ancient concertina type door and did not close properly. Minimal sound proofing between rooms. Plug sockets sparked alarmingly.\n",

Since the guesthouse is located in a small side street, I would suggest to print out the map of the exact location, otherwise taxi drivers may not be able to find it.... It is also important to inform the guesthouse if you are arriving late. The owners are not always there, so they need to give you a code to open the door.\n",

The first room we stayed in had a lovely, roomy balcony and a private bathroom across the hall - simple, comfortable and very clean, and exactly what we needed as a base for exploring Athens. The second room, two weeks later, was even better! (We really appreciated the air conditioning, which was worth the small extra cost).

She was just completely rude and unwelcoming...  There are NO extras here, you have to PAY for the use of aircon, there is no tv and breakfast is a measly offering for 5 Euros each.  I'm still trying to figure out why people rave about this poky little place! Can anyone enlighten me?

We got one of the old ones on the third floor - very small and dark (about impossible to read with the dim lighting) with 2 twin beds even though we are a couple. Romantic? Not so much. Big scratchy wool blanket plus top and bottom sheet was the only bedding. Maybe because we were only staying one night they gave us the crappiest room? No balcony like in the other photos. My mattress was horrible and lumpy - my husband said his wasn't as bad. The room and the hotel in general seemed very clean. Front desk staff were all nice. If you go, make sure to ask for one of the renovated rooms - not worth the price for the one we had. Free wi-fi was nice but no access to the computer after 8. And you only get 30 minutes per…\n",

For back packers,like myself,everything seemed really near,especially after the great tips from Christos,the receptionist, which got me at Parthenon in no time.

      "Review is :We stayed at Marble House 1 week ago for 4 nights. What was really impessive was the services provided from the owners who actually planned our whole itinerary. We had a different suggestion each day for sights, food recmmendations etc. Everything was so close. In 10 minutes walking you could reach Acropolis and Plaka district. All public transportation is one block far. Rooms were recently renovated, very clean with new furniture and Wi-Fi internet connection. But the bonus of Marble House is it's location, as you are in the center of Athens within a cosy, quite dead-end street away from noise and traffic. I would defintely recommend that place to all prospect travellers in Athens...\n",

I attended a conference at a gorgeous hotel that wanted to charge 5xs the price we paid at Marble House... all for a place to sleep, clean up, and keep food cold. For this reason, we chose to stay at Marble House.  The Marble House family/staff are the #1 reason we will return to this establishment. In the morning, we would wake up and have breakfast served by one of the staff whom we dubbed our \"Greek mother\". She would give us advice as to where to go and what times for the best value/least traffic. We were told of great local food that would not be a rip off. At night we…\n",

Its within easy striking distance by public transport from the Acropolis and the main cultural highlights but nicely out of the way of the touristy pedestrian sector of  Athens - so you actually get a better idea of how people in Athens live. Rooms are simple, neat and clean but at that price don't expect any frills -  if you are elderly and need an elevator or room service to take up your luggage forget it : this place is not for you. This is very much a family hotel and Nansy and Thanos her husband at reception are very helpful.

The owner, Nancy was friendly and helpful and helped us to plan our whole itinerary. She recommended the best gyros places, restaurants, hotspots for nightlife and places for sight seeing. One thing that future couples should note is that double rooms are not necessarily double rooms and you may end up in a twin.

Although not in the heart of the Plaka, it was about an 8-minute walk to the Acropolis Museum and the more touristy areas. It's a 5-minute walk to the subway. Our room was clean and simple but very comfortable with a bar fridge and overhead fan. We were unable to reserve a room with a private bathroom and had to share our bath with one other room. For 40 euros a night, it was a steal. Although the street was very quiet, noise from late arrivals did infiltrate the room - carpeting on the stairs would be a welcomed addition. The staff were all very helpful with directions and suggestions. I wouldn't hesitate to go back there again.\n",

Also we liked that Marble House is located in a comparatively quiet neighborhood. A big Supermarket is just around the corner - about 200 Meters from the hotel.  Two rooms have a big roof terrace, two others a big balcony. We had such one and enjoyed it. The rooms are not the biggest but they are clean. They have a ceiling fan, but no air condition. Keep that in mind if you come in summer. The rooms have also no TV – we didn't missed it. Not all rooms have a private bath - thats not everyone's cup of tea.

We enjoyed a peaceful stay in our two en suite rooms with air conditioning as well as the friendly welcome and courtesy that we have always received here.   Our first stay at the hotel coincided with an important F1 Grand Prix race (our son is a devoted motor racing fan) and our congenial hosts arranged for us to be able to watch the race on the large television in reception.  Our second & third stays were actually a \"shoulder end\" of holiday arrangement whereby we spent two nights at Marble House on two occasions  as well as three nights on Aegina Island in between, an easy trip down the Metro to Pireaus Port and then a short ferry…\n",

The staff of the hotel was very nice and gave us a lot of usefull advices to make our stay more pleasant.

They asked for my credit-card number (BTW, practice that I hate), in order to be sure of my presence there, but later they asked to be payed cash, not wanting to afford the commission on credit card transactions.  I arrived in the middle of the nigth: no people present, no assistance at all, just the key left on the desk. If I've had any problems, I would be on my own.  The room was at the 2nd floor, no lift obviously, they hadn't told me... luckily I packed light. The room was pretty bad maintained, scratched paint on the wall, powder on the bed and on the floor, holes in the bath towels.  On the next morning, I've left that hotel....\n",

When I arrived, I was given a tiny room without AC and a door that could have easily been opened with a credit card. I attempted to sleep, but it was unbearably warm. When I asked to be moved to a room with an AC, I was told that there was no room with AC available but was offered a room with a celing fan. When I walked into the room, it smelled of feces. At this point, I was so fed up that I asked for my money back. It was not until I called the tourist police that the hotel clerk offered to give me back half the money. This was not how I had envisioned the beginning of my vacation. STAY AWAY!!!\n",

The beds were uncomfortable and lumpy with huge sags in the middle.  Hot water in the shower was spotty and one window didn't have a curtain.  Not all rooms have a refrigerator, so be sure to ask to see the room when you check in -- despite the variation in amenities, the prices (within one price class) are the same.  That said, the location is convenient -- 10 minute walk from the subway and within walking distance to the Acropolis and main tourist areas.

Booked this place based on Rick Steves website and Lonely Planet recommendation.  Expected something decent for the fair price.  The room was dirty--thick dust on the ceiling fan, filthy floors, the entire room needed a good cleaning.  Did not spend much time there so made the best of it until waking up to little blood marks all over the sheets and realized the bed was infested with bed bugs.  We now have all luggage outside and have washed everything we took to Europe.  It was the worst end to a trip we could have imagined.

Don't get Zina confused with Zinnah! A Greek tourist agent  at the Airport sent us to Zinnah, close to the Omonia Square, a notorious area which tour books say to avoid at nights.

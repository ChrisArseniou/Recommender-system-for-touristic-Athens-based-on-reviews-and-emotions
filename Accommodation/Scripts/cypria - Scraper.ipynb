Metro , bus and taxis are within 5 minutes walk, either to Syntagma square or Monastiraky square.  The hotel stuff was very kind and helpful.  Especially the quys that welcomes you up front and help with the luggages 🧳.   Clean puplic areas , the room was small but clean. Few amenities in the room and a mini bar . Everyday cleaning with replacements. We had a front room and it was a bit noisy during night time. If you want completely silence,  don't get a room in the front side.  Roof top bar with a stunning view of Acropolis and the Parthenon. This is s must. Enjoy your drinks there and try the mix platter with cheese 🧀 and meat cuts (salami, ham etc) Nice bar/cafe at the lobby to relax. Wifi was poor everywhere.  Breakfast was ok, with a lot of staff but it was the same everyday.  Recommend if you want it for the location. Otherwise there's cheaper equally good options , around the center but also within walking distance close to main streets and attractions. …\n",

There is a great view of the Acropolis from the roof top bar. The staff are always ready to help their guests, especially the breakfast staff who go above and beyond to make your stay at the hotel memorable. This is a 4 star hotel with 5 star staff. There is an internet corner and a coffee shop in the  lobby. This would be an  ideal hotel for a business person. It is also ideal for the younger members of the family who prefer to eat McDonald’s even on vacation. There is a McDonald’s Restaurant just around the corner, maybe five minutes. I thoroughly recommend the Athens Cypria, especially during this current period where Covid is still presenting a concern. The hotel has excellent procedures and policies in place to maintain a Covid free environment.…\n",

The ‘big sites’ such as the Acropolis and agoras are within a comfortable walking distance, and if you’re happy to take a wander around the bustling alleys around the hotel and centre (Ermou) you’ll find some hip cafes, wine bars and a few very nice shops. I enjoyed going for a run every morning in and around the nearby national park gardens - such a great way to start the day.  The hotel itself has a contemporary feel whilst holding onto some of its older heritage, in a very tasteful way. It’s very clean and has a relaxed feel. The rooms were exactly what you’d expect…\n",

The staff are very polite and helpful and we loved every minute of our stay. The location couldn’t be better and overall a great experience :) There are lots of older reviews about outdated rooms but I believe all are fairly newly renovated. The included breakfast was also amazing with pretty much every breakfast food you could think of (especially the bacon!!)\n",

Staffs are working hard and very polite. The room is alright and comfortable unfortunately the room soundproofing is not very good. The Mexican  restaurant at front of the hotel play very loud music every night till 2 am . If you are out every night and sleep after 2 am that will be fine for you but if not then avoid to have any room face the street ,as the music through the wall of the hotel and you won't have any good sleep nights.\n",

First of all, its location is fantastic just off the central Syntagma Square and a few steps from the main shopping street (Ermou). Everything is in the vicinity and reachable on foot (Acropolis, the Plaka, Monastiraki, metro station, restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs).  The hotel itself consists of two sections, the old one and the other with renovated rooms overlooking the narrow Diomias Street. There is a bar on top with fine view of the Acropolis. Rooms (renovated) are rather comfortable and equipped with a private safe deposit box, but pretty dark because of the surrounding buildings in the same block. Your bathroom can be tiny, and beds, generally, are not of quality you would expect from a 4 or 3+ star hotel. This is my…\n",

The staff was helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was good and the small rooftop restaurant was a bonus.  The views of the Acropolis were amazing.  Syntagma Square just three short blocks in one direction and Monastiraki Square in the other direction.  Steps from Ermou street where you can reach the agora or plaka areas.  Perfect for exploring.  Highly recommend this property.\n",

They do room service also so u can deliver from the coffee bar ( lunch or dinner or dessert) that it’s on the left of the entrance and just infront the entree u have ice cream and other that is so delicious. And they have another bar that u can see all the nice view from the top.  U have just a few walk restaurant and around the hotel they have shops and everything.  They have gym but I don’t use it.

There are many places to choose from and it will be cheaper and I think a bit better quality.  Definitely take the time to go to the 7th Floor bar in the evening to see the Acropolis all lit up. It's a great place to take pictures of it.\n",

This was despite the fact that most of us had booked last October and supposedly the room was guaranteed! Although the people who moved did not get charged for their first night and the hotel did accommodate them the following night this is not what you need at 10pm after a long journey.

However when you sleep on it, it was hard and the crack between the two beads was so uncomfortable that you could sleep close to my wife.  If they should invest in one single thing... they should definitely get better beds.\n",

The last night we were in the new wing and, although it was an improvement from the old wing, it was very small and the carpets were still a problem.

In fact, we did not have to use any public transport in Athens as the hotel is within walking distance to all main attractions as well as a variety of shops and restaurants. Unlike the modernly decorated and welcoming lobby, the bedroom itself is outdated and could do with some attention. It also had a musty smell upon arriving. The breakfast is basic but does suffice.

The hotel was in a great neighborhood, with lots of nice shops, places to eat, and walking distance to the Athens flea market, the Plaka and Syntagma square.  The staff was extremely helpful (clearly a good business hotel).  The buffet breakfast was good for the whole family, with lots of options!\n",

And the solution to this was: \"I will restart the router, it's probably due to peak hour usage\". Knowing the Internet is as slow at 6 am as it is at 2 am.  The lobby is very well refurbished. Yet, the rooms are the total opposite. The discrepancy lobby/rooms is too deceiving.  Otherwise, location is great, breakfast includes a very big variety and staff is nice.\n",

A small balcony with no views. The late ckeck out was great for us and I can tell is one of the central hotels in Athens that doesn´t charge too much for the check out. When I did the reservation They told me it was ok to have the late check out if we pay 30 € more. We stay until 18:00. Breakfast is ok ,but should be better for a 4 star hotel.\n",

The public areas in the hotel appear to be recently refurbished but the actual bedroom was a bit tired with a small bathroom and a shower over the bath. On arrival the porter carried our bags to the room but then departed straight away without demanding a tip. Room was air conditioned and also had a safe. Breakfast was good with a reasonable selection and coffee brought to the table. The highlight of the hotel is it's new roof top bar. The hotel's location results in an unrestricted view of the Acropolis from the bar. A wonderful spot to relax.\n",

Hotel wasn’t up to par with the rest of the accommodations in the package. On an early morning check out, the staff on the desk was cranky.

Our room had a new floor and best matraces. The bathroom was partly renovated. The shower had some little faults. But this was not so important for us. Breakfast: a good choose of greek and international products. The breakfast room had only a little acoustic problem. As it is although preferred by groups: if they talked together in the morning it was very loud. But I would stay ther again next time.\n",

The room was very clean and equipped with many amenities. The breakfast was very good served in a cozy small restaurant. Minus was the lack of good coffee - there was only Schwarz coffee.\n",

Location of the hotel is very good as you are close to everything. Breakfast is good and reception area is recently renovated and is very modern.

The new roof top bar was disappointing I have to say, but we visited during the day so dont know if the night view is worth it.  Very centrally located for shoppers who want to drop off shopping bags and rush back for more shopping, or for those who want to stroll around the old city streets for sightseeing or dining.

To say they were hard is an understatement; it felt like sleeping on a plywood board, and transferred motion so much that my girlfriend and I constantly woke each other up.

We did not have any bath towels in our room on our last night and when we phoned reception they said they would deliver some. However they did not deliver any. Minor issue but somewhat annoying. The rooms are slightly dated but very clean and they provide products in the bathrooms. Overall a nice hotel and a lovely stay\n",

The front desk clerk said the rooms are recently renovated and you can tell that there was new furniture and new laminate flooring in the room. The washroom is still a 1990s style and that wasn't a problem either. But a 2\" gap at the bottom of the door to the hallway and into the washroom was a little concerning especially when you can hear everything down the hall. But the hotel was definitely ideally located centrally to the shopping district and was a 15 minute walk to the acropolis.  Have to say the I was not impressed with the front desk staff.

      "Review is :As in the American saying: ''Nothing to write home about'', you can write few positive things about Hotel Cypria! It's very centrally located and that's it..!! The rest (for the money you pay) is average and maybe a little expensive.. You have to pay about 100Euros (including taxes) and breakfast not included!! If you book throught the internet, around 90 Euros (Breakfast not included!!) You have to pay 10 Euro extra if you have to have breakfast at the hotel..  It ıs a landlocked hotel, tucked away in a side passageway that links a narrow street and a pedestrian avenue and has no wiev whatsoever that can offer from any of its rooms. Particularly if you are given rooms that starts with 1, you will be looking the wall of the next building some meters away.. Services (room…\n",

However on this visitI discovered that the hotel had been extended and fully refurbished. We had rooms in the new wing and they were lovely!! Comfortable beds, big bathrooms, full air con,free wifi, tv, balcony, safe, minibar and tea & coffee facilities. Lots of small touches,like slipper,toothbrush/toothpaste,shower gel etc that had been missing before. The staff made our stay very pleasant helping with taxis's,buses etc. Would thoroughly reccommend the Athens Cypria Hotel and it will be my 'go to' hotel for all future trips to Athens!!! If you want a hotel in walking distance of Plaka, Parliment…\n",

The fact that the hotel does not provide any arrangement for the parking is pretty surprising. I used Google maps and found one just next to the hotel and it is possible to book a parking lot online there for about 15 euros per day. I do not ask the hotel to make a reservation but at least they should offer this option, because in the area it is almost impossible to find a parking in the street.\n",

It's also fairly central, making it easy to get to most attractions in Athens either on foot or via the subway.  And being so central, you're never far from various restaurants and eateries.

It could have used a good cleaning as well. All of this for 92 EUROS. You are paying for location with this place, and nothing else. Still, overpriced and underwhelming.\n",

Did not try the breakfast as it was an extra charge and there are so many better alternatives in the area within a short walking distance.

The hotel lobby and common areas have all been refurbished to a high standard. The rooms are a little less snazzy, but clean and functional. My shower handle broke, I reported it to the front desk and it had been replaced by the evening.  Breakfast was included, a large buffet covering Greek, continental and cooked breakfast styles - the scrambled eggs looked like they'd been drying under the heater for a bit too long but freshly fried eggs can be ordered from the kitchen.  Staff were helpful and friendly, particularly in the small restaurant/snack bar next to the main entrance.  All in all, I'll definitely stay…\n",

      "Review is :The Cypria is a great hotel for those short term visitors to Athens wanting to see the sights and do a little shopping. Set just off the main Wrmou St shopping district, it's a short walk to the Plaka, Syntagma Square & walking distance to the Acropolis. The rooms were clean, had wifi, air conditioning and well serviced - they even provided toiletries which has been so uncommon for my Greek travels! The staff were super helpful and friendly as well, arranging all transfers and tickets. Highly recommend for anyone needing a few days in Athens in well placed, reasonably priced accommodation. Breakfast is available for a small fee if it's not included as well.  Happy travels!\n",

There is also a safe to store your valuables, which is always a plus.  If you don't have it in your deal, breakfast is 10€ pp. It's okay if you are going to take advantage of it massively (I've seen a bit better and a lot worse), otherwise there's a water boiler in the room to make coffees and plenty of bakeries / donuts stands within 5 mins walk to make your own breakfast for 3€ pp...  Only minor negativity, internet worked really slow for us, so if you're there for business and you need to transfer lots of data it might become an issue...\n",

However the bed was just so uncomfortable I can't in good conscience recommend this place.  I've been able to sleep on firm beds before, but this was so far beyond firm.

      "Review is :My partner stayed at Athens Cypria hotel 26-27th June 2016. The staff was very friendly, helpful and gave a good service. The room had TV, hairdryer, refrigerators with a mini-bar with beers, soft drinks, and chocolate in it. Free use of the safe, aircon and has free wi-fi, although was very slow & couldn't hardly use it. The room had a en-suit which was clean with a shower / bath & with complimentary shampoo, body wash, soap, comb, sewing kit, slippers, & clean towels daily if needed. The hotel has a restaurant and bar area. Athens Cypria hotel is in the perfect location in the Heart of Athens shopping area, and in walking distance to the Acropolis, museums, temple of Olympian Zens, churches,  parliament building and many cafes, bars and restaurants.

      "Review is :We stayed for 3 nights before our extended Peloponnese break. Hotel is easy to find if you use the airport bus. Its an easy flat five minute walk from Syntagma square. We booked a double superior room and had requested a balcony/quiet room and were initially disappointing to be given a large but past its best room on the second floor with no balcony,little light and a depressing feel. We asked for a room change and were provided with a much better room on the third floor, brighter, cleaner and with a large balcony and although there was no view it was lovely sitting out and sipping wine in the warm Athens night.  Room was fairly large with a good double bed although the matress was hard., fridge, TV, in room safe and efficient aircon. There were tea/coffee making facilities in…\n",

But once you walked out from that alley, it's the main shopping area. Extremely convenient for breakfast, lunch, post office (in case you want to mail your postcard) and shopping. It is also very close to the subway station (in less than 10 mins' walk). The Parthenon was just a couple of station away. Subway was just €1.40 for 90 minutes FYI. The room is very clean with a small balcony. There's no view and was overlooking the old building opposite to the hotel. Yet this old building, although looked deserted, was very nice (see the pic).

I stayed here with a huge group of students (27 of us in total) as we were touring through Athens for a university class. We stayed in the hotel for a total of 3 weeks and it was great!  Upon arrival we were greeted by the hotel reception with lovely glasses of fresh orange juice. They were swift in organizing our rooms and gave us our keys right away.  The rooms themselves were basic - two single beds, dresser, wardrobe, safe, fridge, and vanity area. The bathrooms were standard and the water was always warm.

However, I was disappointed to find out that when I arrived at 2 pm (check in time) my room wasn't ready. I was asked to wait about 10-15 min but in reality I waited closer to 30-35 minutes. There were 2 other reservations waiting for their rooms as well. We were given a drink for our inconvenience (water or juice) but as I only had 1 night in Athens, that's not how I wanted to spend my time. Despite the chaos, the staff was friendly and the room was clean but very basic. Given the hotel is still under construction, the lobby is much more modern than the rooms. Breakfast was good with a wide variety of options to choose from.\n",

It is also located on a very busy shopping street that is filled with restaurants and shops.   The lobby is completely redone and is very nice.  There is a coffee shop in the lobby as well.   The front desk staff were very nice and their English was excellent.   We paid for a room with an Acropolis view and it was worth the little bit extra.  It was incredible to walk out on the balcony and see the Acropolis.  The view alone was worth staying here. The room we had on the 6th floor was recently updated.

Every place we wanted to see was within walking distance , and even the train to Pireaus left from a station nearby. There was renovation taking place at the hotel when we went which did not affect us but we were given a 15% discount for the next time. Two problems were the view from our hotel room which overlooked a delapidated building in a side street and the restaurant was only used for breakfasts. The latter caused us to visit excellent restaurants elsewhere.  Overall with the courtesy of the staff, a very comfortable stay.\n",

Beds were nice, bathroom nice, also had a mini frig and rapid boil kettle with cups, tea + coffee packets. We could get a little ice from the bar.  Wifi in room. Breakfast was the best we have seen. This hotel goes out of their way to serve a Greek Smorgasbord buffet with about twenty different offerings, really fun to try all kinds of different breakfast foods. The location is great, just a few steps from the most popular shopping pedestrian street in downtown Athens. We could walk just a couple of blocks to…\n",

Our triple room had a large balcony with a view over the neighboring (litter-strewn) rooftop, and was sunny and cheerful.  The room and bathroom are worn and very basic but reasonably clean, and the decor was IKEA plain.  AC worked great in 100-degree weather.  Good value for a modest hotel in a great central location.\n",

This was a leisure mixed with nighttime work for me. Not really for business trip stay or some one who wants peace and quiet as guests are very loud at nighttime and people slam doors and speak loudly as they stumble back to room drunk. It's reasonable for its location but I'd do more research next time.\n",

The breakfast was a very large spread with meats, cheeses, breads, eggs, vegetables and more! We paid $113 per night in late September (including breakfast and Acropolis view), and it was a good value. I'd probably skip the view if I went again, as we got plenty of great views of it from other places.\n",

The staff begin to clean up while you are still eating, close to 10 a.m. and after this time, you won't find anything to eat, so do not sleep in!  The rooms and bathrooms are standard size in the renovated wing even though we would have preferred a little bit more space and some upgrading considering our \"frequent flyer\" status by now.

The room was cleaned daily and the information in the rooms very clear as to how to use the room service / telephone / tv and claim the free drinks from the cafe bar next door.

We were given a complimentary drink once we were settled. The rooms were clean, basic with shower facilities. And the breakfast! OMG, we were glad we hadn't had dinner, because it was a feast.

You do have to pay extra for breakfast but it doesn't matter that much cause you can get food from a cafe down the street.  The location is spot on, only a few steps away from Ermou street which was great!  The rooms were clean and decent, nothing out of the ordinary.  The wifi was an added bonus, they had fast connection which was very helpful in seeing which places to eat.  The hotel itself is nothing that special but you can pretty much walk anywhere.

One annoyance was the breakfast: it clearly states on Expedia, orbitz, and even their own brochure in the room that breakfast is included. The staff tried telling us our rate didn't include it and that they've had problems with \"this\" agency.

The welcome drink coupon was nice, although we didn't use it, but the dessicated 'welcome' pieces of fruit in the room also had seen better days and were unwelcoming. Finally, the hotel has an awkward lay-out, entailing going up and down a couple of short staircases to reach the main elevator (not recommended for disabled travelers).\n",

This hotel is in the heart of downtown Athens, down a small side street.  There are very few rooms with any kind of view.  Our daughters had reserved an Acropolis view room for us, which we could see as an unobstructed view from our top floor room, standing on our outside balcony, past the number of office and residential buildings around us.   The breakfast, included in our travel package, was delicious and plentiful, including hot and cold, sweet and savory offerings.

It's not far from the airport and with in walking distance of the best shops in the city close to the metro.  Clean rooms great service really really good breakfast. Reasonably priced.  Nice bathrooms which is a big plus in Greece. I don't think there's a better place to stay. Most rooms have a view of the acropolis at night could be romantic a lot of fun.\n",

The price is very reasonable and includes free wi-fi and a buffet breakfast with lots of choices - both hot and cold.  Upon arrival, you are given vouchers for a free drink at their cafe for coffee, ouzo or orange juice - a very nice, welcoming touch.

The staff is excellent every body want to help, and always with a friendly smile. The room are enough comfortable for  the short period that you spend in the room (this is the city to be on the street, no at room). The only concern is the shower, a little dangerous for old people to get in and out, and last suggestion is to increase international tv channels like in Spanish or other languages.

The rooms are small and it doesn't really have any view but who is staying in their room while on vacation? Showering is a challenge but it gets the job done.  Make sure you add for the breakfast.

The rooms are nice and clean.. and if you ask for a non smoking room, you get one.. I am not a kind of traveller looking for luxury during my travel so this hotel was a perfect choice. the breakfast is nice but they could include some variety in their buffet..all the main attractions are easily reachable..since the hotel located on a busy street, it's also quite safe to walk around at night. If you want to take a tour, the hotel staff would gladly help you with the same. If you are looking for a decent place to stay during your stay in Athens, at a good value and awesome location, then Athens Cypria would definitely be the right…\n",

The staff was friendly and did their best, especially those working in the kitchen and serving a reasonably good breakfast. The price on the whole was quite low, but I have to admit I will not come here again. Especially the smell in the bathroom was quite bad. Although they tried to compensate this with some spraying, it seemed to originate from the air flow in the bathroom ceiling, probably due to seriously dirty blowers. This is a potential source of fungus infections, especially in patients with emphysema and/or inhaled corticosteroids. I hope they read this review and try to correct this situation.\n",

We were looking for something close to Syntagma and Monastiraki, since we were flying in then leaving on an early ferry. This hotel met our needs. It isn't fancy, but we weren't expecting that and didn't need it. The \"double bed\" was two narrower beds pushed together, if that's an issue for you. We booked via Orbitz, and breakfast was not included in the price, nor did either of our rooms have a balcony, though some rooms do.

There was a large convention going on in Athens and the hotel was full.  That made a very crowded situation at breakfast as so many guests all arrived at the same time.

It is priced absolutely right, and at the end of your stay, you wouldn't be fussed about the minimal amenities or the quality of the cottons.  Located in the vicinity of the Syntagma square, the place is at a stone's throw from the Metro Station. The Hop-On Hop-Off tour starts from the square, and is a must for first time visitors. It is right at the heart of the shopping streets, and you would find a lot of hustle and bustle. It is a happening place, I must say - there were street singers, there was a Che Guevara Club having its meetings on the road and then, there were little crowds gathered to watch the FIFA World Cup Finals at the eateries around.  What you don't have is the view of the Acropolis from the room or hotel-…\n",

When I told her about my condition she said yes...  A few minutes later she came to the room, brought me a cup filled with ice to serve with drinks.

It takes about 40 to 45 minutes and costs 8 euros per person oneway or 14 for 2 persons. Also there is a little train that starts/pass from Ermou that takes you tour up to Acropolis and museum for 6 euros audult and 4 euros children. A nice experience.\n",

The bathroom was small but well equipped and very efficient.  Located near many attractions not far from Ermou Street, the staff is friendly and helpful.  A little basket of fruit is left in the room each day; a nice touch.  Aside from a restful night's sleep and a good shower, we spend very little time in the room when we travel.   There was nothing about this hotel that wasn't perfect for our needs.  You receive a complimentary coffee/ouzo to be enjoyed in the bar next door, should you wish.

      "Review is :The hotel is located in a great area.  However, upon checking in, we were asked to wait 10 minutes while the two attendants talked among themselves.  When they did check us in, they seemed annoyed and hurried.  While I understand things can get busy, the overall attitude and communication was poor (i.e. I had to ask for the wi-fi password, rather than the front desk offering up that information)  The next strike is that there is absolutely no information on how to contact the front desk, anywhere in the rooms.  I looked through all books, on the wall, brochures - nothing. While it may seem small, it is annoying to have to go to the front desk to request more water and towels.  I was not impressed with any of my interactions with hotel workers.  My guess is that this is because…\n",

Its location just off the popular and busy shopping street Ermou, gave us easy walking access to the historic attractions of the Acropolis area, the Plaka district, Botanic Gardens, Syntagma Square.  The room was generous and well maintained, with effective air con, comfortable bed and as a bonus, a view of the Acropolis from the balcony.  Breakfast was 5/5. I can't comment on the price as it came as part of a package organised from Istanbul, but given the cost of the overall trip, which was extensive between the two countries, it certainly came at a sensible price.  A straightforward, unpretentious and professionally run hotel we'd happily return to and recommend.\n",

Literally a stone throw away (not on my arm!) from Syntagma square, the Hellenic parliament building. Very close to the Acropolis, restaurants on the hill, multiple train stations to get around town. The great thing about the hotel location is the proximity to bus stations even if one is planning trips out of town (we went to Corinth and Sounion). The drawback (if any) would be the small street that it is housed in that cannot accommodate any vehicular traffic. Other than that I would have very little hesitation in recommending this to anyone visiting Athens first time or many times over\n",

It was so convenient to just go down and have everything in front of me - Syntagma metro station, easy access to all the restaurants in the Plaka, great shopping (H&M, Mango, Bershka, Zara, etc.), and tons of cafes. The breakfast buffet was simple but wonderful and convenient, with great service. I stayed on the fourth floor and it was very quiet. The rooms were yes, a bit dated and slightly on the small side, but kept very clean.

I looked at hotels in different neighborhoods, and those in this area in general were more expensive than other areas.  However, this hotel was a rare combination of being reasonably priced and being in an excellent location.  All other facilities and services were at the right level - so no complaints (although one minor note would be that one does miss the 'personal' touch in interactions there) and one will really enjoy one's stay - but the real key to this five-star rating is the perfect location of this good hotel.\n",

Easter is special in Greece as it is celebrated in the Orthodox rite and usually on a different date to the Catholic/Anglican Easter, in 2013 this wa in Early May! More than a month later which also meant that the sun was hot and the sky cloudless.

      "Review is :This place has the best of everything, best location, best value and best breakfast. We had stayed in two other hotels during our June-July holiday in Athens and honestly found this hotel the best one of all and the cheapest!! Its right in the heart of the shopping district and very close to Plaka and everything else...It honestly was the best value for money hotel in central Athens. The rooms were clean, staff were friendly and the buffet breakfast was bigger and offered more variety than the other hotels we stayed at. We payed 75 euro for a double room per night. (For central Athens this was great!!) The other places we stayed at were 100 euro and 130 euro per night, but we all loved the Cypria hotel best of all. They even gave us a free drink card each to use at their bar…\n",

      "Review is :My family and I (2 adults and 2 children - 9 and 12 yrs) recently stayed here for 3 nights.  The location of the hotel is great - felt safe and is very close to the Plaka area and right off of a big pedestrian shopping street.  Very easy to find - we took bus x95 from the airport to the big square and it was a very short walk from there.  The hotel staff are helpful and friendly and breakfast is convenient.  The room was a little dark and run down - it had a very strong smell of smoke, the carpet needed to be replaced and the paint on the walls was a bit bubbly.  Big bathroom with jacuzzi tub though.\n",

      "Review is :This is a decent, midrange hotel in a location very close to Syntagma that cannot be beat.  The rooms are clean, nothing fancy, but definitely good enough considering you are in a city where there is so much to do that you will spend no time in your room whatsoever.   Staff are friendly and there to help.  Surprisingly quiet at night.  Well priced, decent breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again.  Bar has great atmosphere, nice place to pass a hot afternoon.    One thing I would mention is that even though there are elevators, for those that have trouble with stairs, i.e. the elderly or disabled, there are a surprising number of stairs that you need to get to the elevators due to the layout...just an interesting quirk of the layout of this hotel that seems to have been built…\n",

The hotel is situated near Ermou commercial street. Upon our arrival, we were welcomed with a water, coffee or a juice at the bar next to the hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious and a little bit old fashioned but funcional and comfortable. There is wifi in the rooms, which is rare in most of the hotels in Greece. The hotel is a good option if your idea is to visit Athens and sleep in Plaka or next to it avoiding Omonoia square. The bus stop to the airport is situated at a 5 min. walking distance from the hotel.\n",

The staff at check in were lovely, the room was clean and the Breakfast was really nice.   Upon checking out I advised that the toilet did not flush at all and that the aircon leaked water and that I had to put up with water dripping into a buket all night kinda noise. The person filled out a form for the hotel handyman but did not bother to thank me for advising her or offer an aplology which I thought was totally rude.\n",

Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised on arrival, the hotel looks nothing like the photos, in a good way. I arrived early so my room was not ready; I was offered a complimentary drink at the bar while I waited. Upon getting to my room, again I was pleasantly surprised. Although I opted for a room without a view, it was spacious, clean, air-conditioned and had a welcome basket with fruit and slippers.

The receptionist was not the friendliest, but then when they had a shift change the australian greek lady was really great, The rooms are ok, not that nice looking, but the bathrooms are clean, a little small, but me and my friend and my 15 month old baby all fit in the room and used the bathroom just fine. the fruit basket is a great addition, especially since the fruit tasted amazing! not like or crappy canadian imported fruit.

However its clean, quiet, with medium-sized rooms. We have been told that there is a newly renovated wing that is better than the old one, so we asked for rooms on that wing.

      "Review is :Our family of 4 (with our kids 12 and 15 years old) stayed at the Athens Cypria for 4 nights in a family room that had two rooms. We then returned for one more night after touring the Greek islands before heading home. We thought the room that we stayed in for 4 nights was very basic but it suited our needs(we didn't know better rooms existed) and the hotel is an excellent location from the Plaka. We were on the 1st floor but it felt a bit dark and crowded. When we returned for the one night, the room was on the 4th floor, had signficantly more space, was brighter, with nicer bathrooms, was more attractively decorated and had a carpet, which made it feel more comfortable. I would recommend this hotel but look at the room first and request a higher floor possibly since there…\n",

Good location because it is central, but the hotel needs a refreshing. Have in mind that there are two wings and when you book ask to be given a room in the new wing. It is popular with many Cypriots and people coming from England. My closest friend stayed here several times, but this summer I had the chance to visit it myself.   Breakfast was adequate and it was fine as one day we had breakfast with my friend. There are different toiletries in the bathroom which are basic.  There is free wireless internet which is extremely slow, and many times we could not get connection. It badly needs renovation.\n",

Beware of political situation though, because it is also in the heart of where protests are taking place.

The hotel is self has two wings, and we were in the older wing, so I can't speak of the new wing.  Our room was very small with two twin beds pushed together and the tv did not work.

The staff is a bit American-ized (slightly bored and obviously annoyed when asked questions).  The breakfast is filling and has a good selection.  A view, we did not have.  A dirty alley-way. The rooms are not newly furnished and dings and dents are evident on the walls and furniture.    But the LOCATION! We don't spend a whole lot of time in a hotel when we are on vacation, so as long as we feel safe and the bathrooms and sheets are clean, we are pretty happy.  To be right down town and in the heart of all the action and right among all the big sites, well, that was all that we could have hoped for.  Walking distance to everything.

We had to wait for our room to be ready (till about 1:00 although they had said it would be earlier) so we had some coffee and looked around the area which was good with lots of shops and taverns/restaurants.  What was disappointing was when we did get our room it was dark, dingy and very small.  I want to clarify that we have traveled enough to know small is normal in many places and that was not the issue. We had trouble moving around each other once the 3 bags were in the room.

It's also well located for tram/metro and tour pick-up.  We were four, with two teenagers.  Ask for the new hotel wing, rooms are more modern.  Rooms are not huge, but comfortable.  Breakfast, included, is very good with hot and cold cuts, fruits, cereals and breads.  I would certainly stay here again if we comeback, and recommend it for families or business travelers.

The Cypria was perfect as it was not right on Constitution Square so we felt fine coming and going at any time. The rooms aren't grand but we had wifi and it was clean and quiet. The breakfast buffet was fine and the front desk very friendly and efficient. We didn't need a pool and the extras as we were only in Athens for two nights to see the sights and then get on to Santorini. And we saved some money from the trendier expensive hotels. We probably won't stay here next time as we'll just fly thru Athens airport with a stop in the city. But this worked fine for this visit.\n",

It is also one of the few reputable hotels that can accommodate 4 full-sized people (here, 2 parents, 2 teens) in one room, which has a great cost advantage over taking 2 rooms in a comparable hotel elsewhere. The distinguishing feature of Cypria is its location, just a few short blocks (barely one US city block) from Syntagma (Consititution) Square, close to the Metro and buses, and only a few minutes walk from the Acropolis, Plaka, Monastiraki, Lykavittos, and lots of other places of interest.

The room itself was Ok. For some reason, it really stunk like someone hadn't bothered to flush the toilet after \"using the facilities\". Thankfully, the smell dissipated once we opened the window (although we noticed the smell came back the next day). Another thing we noted was there was a 2\" gap under the bathroom door.

      "Review is :I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in July - I was in athens on my own and so had choosen the hotel pretty carefully as I wanted to stay in an area where i felt safe.  The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from Syndagma square so the location is great - it's on a side street off Ermou, but my room was really quiet still.  My room was a good size with neutral decor - prefectly clean, as was the bathroom where the shower was over a small bath and powerful with lots of hot water.  I had requested a room with a balcony and got one - in fact the balcony was HUGE almost a terrace really!  only downside was there was no light out there so when sitting out in the evening had to sit close to the door to have the light!  The air conditioning was great which was a huge bonus in athens in…\n",

      "Review is :Our family of four stayed at the Cypria this past June for five nights.  Two adults plus 10 and 12 yr olds.  We enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is accurately billed as a 3-star.  We booked due to reviews (here and elsewhere) that touted the good location.  We booked online, and everything was as expected upon arrival.  Diomeias Street was unknown to the cabbie, but when we told him \"near Ermou and Syntagma\" and showed him the mapquest printout he found it easily.  We booked a quad (not too many of those in Athens).  The room was adequate, and we joked \"kind of like a bed showroom\" upon seeing the beds all jammed into the room.  Fine with us; we simply needed a sleeping and showering location as we were out and about all the time.  Breakfast was included, and was good.  Room cost…\n",

Hotel is only a few blocks from the busstop (which is the last stop from the Athens airport). Located on a side street just off of the the main shopping street by Syntagma Square. Big room with comp fruit when we arrived. No view, as the quad room was booked. Comp full breakfast, eggs, bacon, meat cheese, yogurt, coffee, tea, greek coffee, fruit. Staff were very helpful.

The room was spacious, clean, quiet and air-conditioning in working order. Bathroom was small but clean. On arrival, fruit bowl and a complementary drink voucher at the hotel bar were provided. …\n",

The room was very comfortable and spacious, with a king size bed, jacuzzi, cable TV and a desk. No views (just the street) Breakfast was good. Most employees were gentle.

      "Review is :We stayed in Cypria early May 2008 for 3 nights. The hotel met all our expectations and some more. Our original criteria of choosing Cypria among the many budget hotels were confirmed after our arrival.  1. Location is a few small blocks from Syntagma Sq, which is the gateway to all the rest of Athens. Walking with our luggages from the hotel to the metro station (airport line) took about 10 min. It took us longer to find the hotel on the first day, since the street names are hard to follow even with a map.  2. The hotel is on a tiny alley only one block from heavy vehicle or pedestrian traffics on both sides. But our room was quiet like in the suburb. In fact, sitting on the sidewalk cafe/bar and enjoying our welcome drink (ouzo!) was quite a peaceful and relaxing moment.  3.…\n",

The rooms, though not luxurious, were clean, spacious by Greek standards, and had all reasonable amenities. The showers even had curtains - not something to be taken for granted in Greece - though somehow we still got water on the floor every time. No matter.

We took the metro to and from the airport. It is an easy trip ... much better than dealing with the Athens taxi drivers. We walked to most of the sites. The ones at a little distance like the Archaeology Museum are easy to reach on the tourist hop on and off bus,  I think it's bus 40, it cost 5 euros for the day. It goes to all the major sites and museums. You can get it at Syntagma Square.  Over all an excellent hotel for the price and location.\n",

Take the blue line from Airport and get down at the 12th stop Syntagma. Walk towards the Mc Donald and continue walking down the Ermou street until you see Berto Lucci. Make a right at that street. Hotel is at the end of the the street. Also the hotel is walking distance to Plaka, Monastiraki, Agora and Akropoli- you can find a lot of good eating place  close to the hotel. I liked the Nira Naav next to Mc Donald.  2. Breakfast- was excellent. Had 2 types of egg, tea/coffee, lots of bread, turkish coffee, croissant and fruits.  3.

We opted for the old wing with an Acropolis view, and sitting in the sun with a cold beer and kebab was far more pleasant than sitting in the room watching CNN.

The hotel is situated near busy shopping areas and in a generally good area of town. We always felt safe in and around the hotel.

By USA standards it would be classified as a 3 STAR hotel, however by Greece/European standards it definitely deserves its 4 STAR rating.  I suggest getting to the hotel by metro, rather than taking a taxi from the airport. The metro is 5E/person (one way) from the airport, vs the 35E or so taxi fare. It takes about 40 minutes by metro, 25-30 by taxi. With our conversion rate being rather deplorable, and since you're looking at THIS hotel I know you're into saving money. The metro leaves every 30 mins, so plan accordingly(bathroom breakes, etc), so you dont JUST miss it and have to wait another half an hour.   It is the only metro line that…\n",

Only drawback was that in the middle of the night, we had someone from reception knock on our door to let us know that we were using the air conditioner too much, so he set the control and told us not to go above that--at the time it was the middle…\n",

Our rooms were large and pleasant, although one room had carpet that was stained, but not dirty, in one corner.  The Cypria has an excellent location because it is on a quiet side street off Ermou -- the main shopping street -- and is a block or two from Syntagma and the Plaka.  It is a simple modern convenient hotel that offers exceptional value to families, particularly if they book on the hotel website.\n",

Location was perfect: we could walk to the Acropolis, shops, resturants, plazas, and to transportation, but the hotel is in between busy streets so you have peace and quiet.  The room was a good size and clean, hot breakfast with cereals and fresh fruit, was more than we expected, and the staff was friendly and helpful.    There is a sightseeing 'train' just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  Also a 5 minute walk is a huge plaza (with a government building) that has music and street entertainers in the evening.  Check with the hotel staff about free evening concerts at some of the excavation sites. We definately recommend Hotel Cypria and will stay there again.\n",

It has a lovely coffee bar outside, perfect for a quiet read, a low-key business meeting or just planning your assault on the Athens shops!  The staff are friendly and speak good English (important in Athens as the Greek language is almost impenetrable). The rooms are more than adequate.   The low point is breakfast.

      "Review is :Everything everyone has said is true.  I would recommend this hotel and stay there again myself.  Great location, nice breakfast, helpful staff.  The walk from the train station to the hotel is uphill and it took us longer than 3 minutes and what was a 37 degree day.  Going to the train station is probably better as it's down hill.  The clothes shops are great and the markets in the area are great for picking up presents.  Taxi to the airport was about 26 euros.  I wish I'd asked for a room with a view.    The hotel staff spoke english, but it seemed everyone in Athens spoke english.\n",

      "Review is :My husband & I stayed at Athens Cypria three different occasions while in Greece. We were pleased each time. The location is excellent - just a short walk to the Metro with fantastic shopping all around. It's also near the Acropolis, the ancient Agora, Syntagma and lots of other sites.  Most of the rooms are newly renovated, although a few aren't, but even those are still pretty nice. All of our rooms were clean and and I would say two out of three were large by European standards.  What most surprised me was the service. We needed wake up calls for three days and they were terrific. Each morning we got a wake-up call and a follow up 15 minutes later a personal follow-up call. (You don't even get that at a Marriott). We also requested a cab for early in the morning the night…\n",

      "Review is :Of the 3 hotels at which we stayed in Greece, this was my favorite.  The location, price (through priceline-europe[--]) and accomodations were great.  The hotel is not too far from Syntagma Square (although make sure you get directions before you go because the ones that come with the voucher/confirmation are terrible) and just a short walk to Plaka/the Acropolis.  I am not much of a shopper but I loved the shopping in this area. . .there are many trendy stores and cafes just outside of the hotel.  We stayed in one of the just-completed new rooms and it was great.  No view but the accomodations were excellent.  Some of the staff members were very helpful and friendly; the others were always helpful but not as warm or friendly.  The breakfast was also very good.\n",

There are plenty of coffee shops and shoe/clothing stores right outside the lobby door. The room was adequate and clean  (a cot was brought in to accomodate the 3 of us).  We were able to get a room on the 6th floor with a good view of the Acropolis.  Yes, you could see the unattractive rooftops of other buildings but there was an unobstructed view of the Acropolis from our small balcony. Room 607 looked like it had the best view from all of the 6th floor rooms.   Definitely request a room with a view if you can because it was the same price for a room without a view.   Upon arrival we were given a free drink coupon…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed in the Athens Cypria Hotel on May 29th to June 1st.  I picked this hotel based on the location and the reviews that I found on Trip Advisor.  It was a good hotel.  The location is excellent, near the Parliament building, among tons of shopping and restaurants, and within walking distance of the major sights.  The hotel staff was very nice and helpful,  and spoke English.  The hotel itself was adequate.  The room was clean, however the bed had a very thin mattress on it and was hard.  If you are exhausted from traveling and walking around to all of the sights you may not even notice it.  The room could use some updated decor.  If you are looking for a great location for a reasonable price, which is what I was looking for, this is the hotel for you.  If you prefer hotels…\n",

Friendly and very helpful staff.  Excellent view of the Acropolis from our room.  You have to request a room with a view and it may cost you a little more but well worth it.  The rooms have a little balcony where you can enjoy the view with a glass of wine.  Good breakfast which is included in the price.  The  rooms were clean with a good shower.  We travelled to Greece with our 2 year old and the hotel accomadated us with a baby cot which he loved.  He slept well and ate well.  The people were very friendly and accomadating to our son.  We really enjoyed our time in Athens and the Cypria was a great place to start and end…\n",

If you don't, well, you can walk on by.  We really enjoyed just walking around from here - right by parliament house, where we saw a little boy imitate the soldiers switching positions; street performers include musicians young and old and the occasional clown or mime; old churches are open if you are quiet and dressed.    The hotel itself was comfortable and the staff was very helpful. Staff spoke English and helped arrange transport back to airport and to a museum on a rainy day.

      "Review is :I did a lot of research on various Athens hotels before I choose the Athens Cypria Hotel. Was I glad I did!  A MOST excellent choice. The off-season single room rate for Nov 2005 that I got directly from the hotel (Euro 75/night for a good size room with 2 single beds pushed together) included tax and the delicious full buffet breakfast that all the other reviewers have  talked about. The hotel never responded to my emails so I ended up faxing them, and the front desk woman and I faxed back and forth. All my questions were answered and everybody at the hotel were extremely helpful and accommodating. I would recommend contacting the hotel directly for reservations, as the rates on their website were considerably higher! The hotel has 8 rooms on the 6th (top) floor of the hotel…\n",

The hotel is simple, not luxurious, but very comfortable and with many of the amenities of more expensive hotels. The staff were friendly and helpful.  (I can't imagine which hotel the two negative reviewers visited, but it doesn't sound like the Cypria.)  The buffet breakfast was just right--approved by my husband, who really likes a full meal in the morning.    We stayed at the Cypria twice during our time in Greece.  Our first room was comfortable and quiet but looked into a light well.  It was fine for recovering from jet lag.  For our return from a trip out…\n",

Great location, about 5 min walk from Syntagma Square metro station, half a block from Ermou Street shopping, about 10 minutes to (the start of the path to the) Acropolis.  The room was small, but this is Athens.  Clean, friendly, excellent breakfast (included) - one of the few to have bacon & eggs, etc.  Nothing spectacular, but we didn't come to Athens to sit in our room.  This may not sound like such a rave review, but I highly recommend the Cypria.\n",

The rooms were nice sized and very clean.  There was a basket of fruit in our room both times, as well as \"welcome\" drink coupons.  The breakfast was a full buffet with fresh juice, tea and coffee (even made to order Greek coffee), hot items such as eggs, bacon and sausage, cereals, Greek salad \"fixings\", cold cuts and cheese, yogurt and honey, cake and several types of bread and rolls.

But I booked directly with the hotel via e-mail, guaranteed the reservation with a credit card, and verified the reservations in writing via fax. Even when I had to make last minute changes by canceling two of the reservations the day before the scheduled arrival, there weren't any problems, such as a fee for canceling less than 24 hours in advance. When my friend and I checked-in with the remaining reservation, the hotel clerk reduced our rate for the last night because our departing flight was leaving so early we would not be able to have breakfast in the morning.   We found the location ideal for walking…\n",

I immediately checked out once I was shunted over to the Astor. No explanation or help from Cypria. I would blackball both hotels. In addition, I am only receiving credit from hotels.com for two nights of the stay, minus their \"profit\" from the first night. BEWARE: you can be overbooked through hotels.com even though  you pay in full in  advance. I'm now online waiting for one of their managers to explain to me their policy.\n",

I regretted not having being able to stay at this hotel from the start.  I had to stay in the Plaka Hotel for three nights. Athens Cypria is very good located near Ermou and Syntagma Square, however I find Plaka Hotel better located in terms of archaelogical sites and restaurants. But, for a similar price, I found the Athens Cypria far nicer (looked newer and more elegant), with more helpful staff and with little things that make a difference: a welcome drink and a basket full of fresh fruits awaiting my husband and I. If I come to Athens again I will definitely try to book this hotel from the start.\n",

If your a single traveler like I was, request room 608 which has an enormous balcony with an unobstructed view of the Acropolis.  The room was very basic, but the location is so convenient to everything that you’re rarely in it.  Just minutes from the Plaka, Syntagma Square, Acropolis, shopping on Ermou and Kolonoski, etc. this is perhaps the best value/location of any hotel Ive ever stayed at.

Waking up to the views of the Temple of Zeus and breakfast in the stunning homely rooftop restaurant looking at the Parthenon!!!! Just round the corner  to the attractions and the tourist Plaka with an restaurants and shops so guests can stay out and relax in the evening too .  THE STAFF ARE AMAZING!! The reception staff are always  welcoming and happy to help . The gents at the door  are  always opening the doors with a smile and cheerful greeting .  Lovely choice of the breakfast and the restaurant staff are absolutely amazing !!!!!! We really enjoyed breakfast due to the lovely choice and their warm hospitality. All the staff were amazing but there 4 who were always there during our stay and looked after us so well - thank you CHRISTINA , EVITA , THANASIS and DIMITRIS , we really appreciate your kind care during our stay . Nothing was too much and they made absolutely lovely special coffees and hot chocolates to guests on request even during the busiest times . EVITA  just heard my daughter say hit choc and came running to offer one . Christina was always ensuring we were looked after all the time . I don’t know how to  thank the staff enough . Perfect team to look after homilies on holiday as they are so kind to the children .  The cleaning team was so friendly and rooms were in the best condition on a daily basis !! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!…\n",

Lower floor, street side rooms can be a little noisy, so you might consider some ear plugs or asking for a room on a high floor. Breakfast is amazing! There are hot foods and cold foods and lots of pastries, all quite good. I especially enjoyed the Greek items:  spanakopita, tiropita, dolmas.

The heavy glass doors helped with the car noise, but not the cycles. The balcony was sizable, but no furniture so I had to ask for two chairs which were promptly brought up. We sat outside a bit to maybe witness a cycle crushed as they passed between two cars which we though must be a frequent occurrence, but not during our stay. The room was average and clean, nice bathroom. The buffet breakfast was below average  for Europe for an allegedly four-star hotel, which it is not, three-star at best. This choice of hotel was not made by me. I would not stay here again, There are likely much better choices for this price range.\n",

First the elevators are the tiniest I have ever seen in my life, I don't exaggerate when I say it can only fit 2 adults and 1 child max. This means most of the time you have to take the treacherous stairs. The room I was given was dark and dingy with dirty floors and contained bugs. Also there is nothing in this room that would seperste it from a 3 star motel. The walls and doors are thin and I would constantly wake up from yelling in the hallways early mornings and late at night. The only good thing was the breakfast buffet in the roof with excellent view of the Acropolis and the city. The cleaning lady was very friendly and would clean our room really well. It's a close walk to Plaka…\n",

Major attractions were in walking distance including the Acropolis and Acropolis museum. We had an awesome view of the Acropolis from the hotel’s rooftop restaurant/bar. Planka (shopping) was right around the corner. The rooms were a nice size and very clean. Beds were comfortable. Room contained a safe and mini fridge. Bottled water was free on the day’s stay. Water was also available in the lobby.  The hotel staff was awesome. Before arriving, we were sent a link to a transportation company to use to get from the airport to the hotel.   The company was nice, and reasonably priced. When I return to Athens for another visit, I will be staying at the Athens Gate Hotel.\n",

We had Greek salads and a nice bottle of wine in the restaurant hotel for dinner, and a complimentary breakfast the next day.  Definitely a winner! And for celiacs, the location cannot be beat. Arcadia and Greek Stories are close by and both completely “get”  gluten-free dining and offer free bread and sometimes beer.   We will be back!\n",

We only used it at the end of the day.  The children got straight in and we sat and  had a drink until a bed or 2 became available.  No problem.  The metro is right outside and cheap and easy to navigate.  The area was ok.  A few homeless yes, it's a city. But plenty of places close by to eat so no need to wander too far anyway.

Staff were friendly and the rooms clean. The air conditioning worked very well, and very welcome during a hot August visit.  The beds were comfortable.    Elevators are a bit slow, small, and in frequent use.  Not a problem if you are on a lower floor.  Our room faced the main road and, despite having a beefy sound insulating window, was quite noisy.  Road noise did decrease a little overnight, but the insulation was no match for the occasional loud motorcycle (of which there are a lot in Athens).

We were on the 4th floor but I imagine if you were any lower traffic noise from the main road might be an issue. The beds also were not particularly comfortable; both me an my wife had troubled sleep because of it. On the plus side, the proximity to the centre/acropolis and other sites is perfect. The view from the rooftop bar is stellar, and the shower was nice and powerful.   Definitely felt like the whole place lacked effort, but for a couple days I guess you have the comfort of being within walking distance of all the touristy spots.\n",

The fire alarm did go off soon after we arrived while I was showering and that was a little scary but my roommate walked down from 3rd floor to find out it was a false alarm. I appreciated that we could push the beds apart. Breakfast was decent but I rated the hotel a 4 because the paid, reservations only restaurant dinner was just ok.

Although the Acropolis entrance was effectively 3 minutes behind the hotel the receptionist directed us the wrong way.  Rooms on the small size although ours had a balcony overlooking a side street. Quiet enough though.  As I’ve mentioned breakfast was OK. Eggs had clearly been out a long time. But breads and croissants were warm and good.  You’d probably only want 1 or 2 nights.

We couldn't asked for a better location.  3 minutes to the entrance of Acropolis and Acropolis Museum, 7 minutes to the Plaka, 10 minutes to Syntagma Square.  All the major tourist spots are within a 20-minutes walk.  As a base to explore downtown Athens, this is a perfect location.  We booked the suite for the Acropolis views, and it did not disappoint.  The suite takes up the entire northern side of the 7th floor.  With a balcony door facing the Acropolis and another balcony door facing the Temple of Apollo.  The balcony (it's more of a terrace) wraps around the entire exterior that gives you 270-degrees of view.

The WiFi connection was stable and fast enough to watch videos. The balcony is a plus. There were also a few downsides.  When I was checking in, the receptionist told me with a smooth intonation that they could not satisfy my request to have a view on Acropolis because \"it's a last-minute reservation\", even though I booked more than a month in advance. It is understandable that the view on Acropolis is popular, but lying and blaming the customer instead of honestly addressing this topic made a bad first impression.  For an \"executive\" room, the room was quite small (to be fair, the balcony was large enough). Its size…\n",

Thanks to a very welcome reception, variety of very tasty food, very friendly waiters in a relaxed seating on the 8th floor with a magnificent view of the Parthenon and the Temple of the Olympian Zeus (especially during the night lights), immaculate housekeepings and well designed and respectfully enforced Covid-19 procedures, my stay, in every sense, was very relaxed and enjoyable.

      "Review is :The good thing about Athens Gate Hotel is the proximity to major attractions and the market place so you will not spend time and money on Taxi as everything is a short walk. The rooms are good and the buffet breakfast is also good. Would Not recommend booking through their own web site if you are looking for better rooms with view on higher floors. I booked through their site over a month ago and despite requesting in advance the rooms with the view or better floor we got neither. Go with your credit card or other means if the price difference is not much.\n",

      "Review is :This hotel could not be better located. Very close to the Acropolis museum and the Temple of Olympian Zeus. The top floor has a bar and restaurant which has a great view of the Acropolis on one side and Olympian Zeus on the other. The receptionists were really helpful and friendly. We asked for a room on the 6th floor with a view of the Acropolis before we arrived and they managed to fulfil our request.   The rooms are small but well appointed with a good modern bathroom and air conditioning which we found worked well.  There was also a fridge which could be filled with drinks we bought at the nearby mini-market.   When we were leaving, it was. O trouble to store our bags for a few hours and organise a car to the boat terminals.  A wonderful stay. Would definitely recommend this…\n",

We were always greeted when we came back to the hotel and I felt like they were making sure guests were safe and enjoying their trip. The restaurant was great, wonderful views from the rooftop. The location was perfect for visiting the Acropolis and the other local historic sights. All were walking distance and stores and food was literally a few minutes outside the hotel.

Our first morning I thought I'd visit one of the nearby coffee shops and bring coffee back to the room.  When I entered the lobby, the bellman on duty sprang to his feet to ask if I was looking for something.  When I said \"coffee\" he had me follow him to the lobby bar, where he prepared 2 cups, one with milk for my wife's.  Our room was on the first floor and I expected I'd just climb the stairs to get there.  The bellman beat me to the punch, opening the elevator door and ushering me in.

We had to say what time we wanted breakfast and the previous buffet was table service but ... it was amazing. Christina and Ares were stars and the selection of food food was outstanding. The two people mentioned here were first class and we really enjoyed their characteristic Greek sense of humour, philosophical and political awareness and just great hospitality. The back facing room was quiet, comfortable and all rooms have very comfortable beds. The location of the hotel is perfect. A few minutes walk to the Plaka and the National Botanic Gardens. An amazing stay in an uncertain summer. We're looking forward to returning. The photo is…\n",

I could have stared at it from my balcony forever. The restaurant / terrace on the 8th floor offered incredible views of the Acropolis, the Temple and other beautiful landscapes. This restaurant was extremely accommodating, catering to my every whim including providing packed lunches for my tours and hot water whenever I requested it (to make tea in my room - no kettles were allowed in our rooms for Covid reasons). The receptionists were always very helpful. The location couldn’t have been better, walking distance to the Acropolis, the Acropolis Museum, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Roman Agora, the…\n",

The Acropolis and the associated metro station are right around the corner.  There are tons of little restaurants and shops within a short walk.  The breakfast is included and offers a large variety of options.  The staff was friendly.  It is right along a major road so some reviews said that it can be noisy. I was on the Acropolis side (you have to request that in your booking)  which is opposite the major road and I didn't notice the noise and I am a light sleeper..  I would definitely go back.\n",

We were almost at the very foot of the Acropolis; the main entry gate at the west end of Acropolis was just 10 minutes stroll away, the Acropolis Museum not even 5 minutes away. The Temple of the Olympic Zeus was right across the street though the official entrance was about a 7-minute stroll from the hotel. Syntagma Square was literally up the road, 12 minutes along the boulevard in front of the hotel. Get exploring around the historic and quaint Plaka district that borders the hotel 2. Great views. Head to the restaurant/bar on the 8th floor. Breakfast was included during our stay and it seemed the west side - facing the Acropolis - filled up quickly. It…\n",

      "Review is :My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.  You cannot beat the location and view.  You have two views to choose from on the rooftop bar/restaurant.  On one side you have the Acropolis, and the other has the Temple of the Olympian Zeus.  The prices at the bar were reasonable.    The rooms were small, but we had no issues with it.  It was clean, and the bed was comfortable.   We had a room with the view of Zeus's temple, and it just looked beautiful at night all lit up.  A big advantage to this hotel is the location.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go including, Acropolis, Plaka, Ancient Agora, Monistiraki, Panathenaic stadium....etc.  You will not be disappointed if you stay here.  One thing that can be improved is the breakfast.  Although it was quite…\n",

Roof top restaurant with views of the Acropolis and Temple of Zeus and from this location you could walk to all the sites of historical significance - The reception, when asked, recommended a very good local restaurant, The Arcadia - again very good value. Excellent buffet breakfast included. Able to store our luggage when we vacated our room at 1200 hours as taxi pick up not till 1700 hours. We would definitely go again\n",

Just 100m from the bus stop for City tours - a choice of 3 companies - and plenty of seemingly authentic Greek restaurants within 1 block!  The hotel has rooms overlooking the Temple of Zeus and at the rear, overlooking the Acropolis. The restaurant/bar on the 8th floor is a must visit as the views are brilliant - and it’s where breakfast is served.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms, with a balcony, are a decent size.  We stayed in 606 which was fine although we faced the road and perhaps a room at the back facing the Acropolis would be quieter at night!  There is a good sized lounge, with a bar, on the ground floor.  We stayed 2 nights and this hotel was brilliant for our stay\n",

Staff very attentive. Just a couple of niggles. Pillows much too hard and deep for me. Asked at reception for a softer one. Unfortunately they don’t supply any, so unable to sleep well. Although there was a kettle and cups in the room only tea and sugar available. I rang the number given in the details for the room to ask for coffee and milk, and was told they don’t offer these ( even though they are mentioned  in the brochure). A table and chairs would also have been nice to have on the balcony. Would still recommend however, as we had a fantastic time.\n",

The Acropolis, the Temple of Zeus, Roman Forum, Olympic Stadium , Aeropagus. The Plaka district is right there and so easy to walk.   The hotel is very nice, rooms were on the smaller side but very adequate. The shower was great. We had a veiw of the Temple of Zues and the other side had views of the Acropolis. We had a 5th floor room. The maid service was great we requested extra towels which were provided every day. The room was very clean.   The veiw from the restaurant was fantastic and the complimentry breakfast was very good nice selections of eggs fruit and meat.  In my opinion you cant go wrong with this Hotel.\n",

We were are the back of the hotel so the balcony view was just of the street behind, but the road was quiet so it was peaceful. Athens is quiet a polluted city, so being on a road not used much rather than the main road into the city (as the front is) really has advantages. Views from the roof restaurant and bar was unrivaled, you could see all a cross Athens, and you feel you can almost touch the acropolis.   Obviously perfectly located for the temple of Zeus and the Acropolis.

The room was a bit cramped,  but still manageable. Front desk and door staff were always happy to answer questions.

The location was truly ideal...especially for such a short stay. The service was impeccable and the daily breakfast spread was lovely.  It is located about 40 min from the airport and 30 min from the ferry and in the heart of everything you would want to do as a tourist in the Athens city center.

Happy hour and a delicious dinner on the rooftop bar/restaurant with stunning views of the Acropolis were the perfect way to top off an amazing trip to Greece!\n",

      "Review is :Location is excellent, easy to get to and a very easy walk to enter the Plaka.  You might not realize it unless you look at a map but it’s also only about 3 blocks from the main square where the Grand Bretagne and parliament are located.  The included morning breakfast is very good and the view of the Parthenon is pretty cool.  I recommend sacrificing the perfect breakfast view to sit inside or under cover because even at 7am, the sun is powerful in the summer.  You’ll still see plenty of the Parthenon each time you get up.  Rooms are basic and utilitarian but totally adequate.  No one comes to Athens to stay in their room all day (I hope.)  We had two adjoining rooms that were at the end of a hallway - there was out outer door that could be closed off and opened with only one…\n",

We were delighted with our rooms - very comfortable beds, fabulous shower and everything clean and modern.

The breakfast offered was excellent, with a variety of traditional foods, and being able to enjoy it with a view to the Acropolis was a great start to our days there!

Breakfast was good.  There were other land-marks easily discernible from the restaurant.  At night we would walk out the front door and within 50 meters we entered the Plaka area with the cobblestone streets and outdoor restaurants.  The only negative of this hotel are the two tiny lifts.  Not able to take 4 adults, certainly not with luggage.  But it was no problem for us, being just one couple and anyway: all the positives certainly outweighed this tiny problem.\n",

You are only a short walk from the sights, shops or restaurants and there is plenty of choice around. Getting around Athens from the hotel was very easy by foot, but also the hop-on hop-off bus stop was a minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel has great views of the Temple of Zeus and Acropolis which are great for breakfast on the rooftop. I booked a superior room with a view and we were given one facing the Acropolis (pictures attached). The only thing I would question is what else was superior about the room, except for the view. It’s seemed to be a “standard” room and the upgrade being the view of the Acropolis. Having said that the room…\n",

We arrived late one night and met up on the rooftop bar for drinks with a view of the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus! Stunning at night.

It’s 2 minutes walk to the Plaka District (Old Town) and has unbelievable views to either the Temple of Olympic Zeus or the Acropolis. The staff are great and very helpful. Room facilities are fine - excellent cleaning and a small maintenance issue in our room was dealt with promptly. A total treat was to have breakfast in the 8th floor dining room with its terrace and amazing views - and the selection of food was top quality. We also dined in the restaurant one evening watching the sun set behind the Acropolis. Unforgettable! We would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly.\n",

The rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff was very accommodating and polite.  Our favorites were Amahlia, who worked the front desk and Dimitri who worked in the rooftop dining area.  Everyone at the hotel went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.   If you can, request a room on the 7th floor at the rear of the building. You’ll have a balcony and an unimpeded few of the Acropolis. It was absolutely breathtaking especially at night when the lights were on.  I would definitely stay here again.\n",

Despite the late arrival the receptionist was very accommodating and friendly and quickly gave us our keys and showed our room. The room itself is relatively spacious, the bed is extremely comfortable and there were charging ports right next to our beds (at least in the room we were given). The bathroom is again spacious - and quite frankly how I'd like my bathroom to look in my house - with towels, shampoos, gels, creams and even slippers provided. Everything was extremely clean. The cleaner cleaned our rooms daily and on our final day actually came twice (when we had left in the evening) to leave us a nice thank you note and a couple of sweets! So definitely from a…\n",

First night we got a room facing the front. We couldn’t sleep because of the noise from traffic. Next morning we talked to the manager Christopher who was very nice. He moved us to this room on the 7th floor facing the back. The view was fantastic and the room was larger and much quieter. The room was very clean. Breakfast was good but the food was the same everyday. They should change at least some of the selections.\n",

We only ate breakfast which is included in the price and was pleasantly surprised by the choice available to us. Very well cooked and very tasty.  Drinks were also very reasonable for a hotel also.  Acropolis is only a very short walk from the hotel and very close to lots of nice restaurants also.  If staying in Athens I would recommend staying here. The only down side is if you request a view of the temple of Zeus you’ll be over looking the main road which is rather noisy at most times.

If you don’t want to walk or need to travel far, the metro stations and train station are nearby. Additionally, you can grab a taxi very easily.   The hotel itself is moderately priced and very clean. The rooms are simple and cozy. Nothing too fancy, which is fine because there is so much to do in this area, you shouldn’t need to spend too much time in your room. There are a few lounge areas to sit in as well.

For us, it was worth the extra cost of the room to pay for a view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. If you do book one of the rooms facing the Temple be aware it faces a main thoroughfare and the traffic can be noisy starting early in the morning til late at night. Keep the sliding glass door closed if it bothers you, they are pretty good quality but it does not totally omit all traffic noise. The morning breakfast was delicious and offered a nice variety. The views were amazing. Sunsets were also incredible and well attended so make dinner reservations if you want to have a guaranteed table. The wi-fi was spotty on a regular basis and I had…\n",

The hotel offers great views, and there's nothing like eating breakfast and looking over at all of Athens- the Acropolis, the Temple of Zeus, the city in general.  I came for the marathon, and the location was perfect being only a quarter mile walk back from the Panathenaic stadium.  It was also not more than 10 minutes to walk anywhere you would want to go, and the service was amazing.  Word of warning, though, it is noisy at night bc of the location.

Rooms are clean and nice, although some noise from the main street (we stayed at 4th floor facing the street) - some would get annoyed about this. Breakfast is good, although ordinary. We had dinner in the restaurant one night, but that was a pre-marathon buffet, so would fairly not judge the restaurant based on this (but lots of carbs and energy for the run :-)). Great views from the rooftop restaurant, but the bar (and the lobby for that sake) is not really that cosy and not really a place you want to hang out for a longer time.

However the location of the room was good for not having any noise, but the view was for the back to the street, which we were aware, but not a problem.  The breakfast was very dull, the eggs were fried only one way or hard boiled.  The bacon was usually limp, so if staying for 4 nights, it gets old; no change in anything offered, but workable. The location was in the City center, so many rooms are smaller than the US person is used to.\n",

And the rooftop restaurant has a fantastic view of the Parthenon (and an equally good view of the Temple of Zeus from the bar).  Plus the food is quite good and reasonably priced.  The rooms are not huge, but by European standards they are a good size, and they are modern, well arranged, and clean.  We will stay at the Athens Gate on future trips to Athens.\n",

      "Review is :If you are travelling to Athens to see the sites, the Athens Gate Hotel is the place to stay.  All of the major attractions are within an easy walking distance.  It is considered a 4 star hotel and it is clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced but it is directly across the street from The Temple of Zeus and just a stone's throw from the Acropolis (certain rooms offer views of one of these and I would recommend booking one of those for sure).  Best of all the roof top restaurant and bar literally have one of the best views in the world and is an amazing place to sit and gaze at the Acropolis by day or night.  A decent buffet breakfast is included in your room rate. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I have seen complaints that the rooms are small but they are up to date…\n",

      "Review is :Athens Gate is a clean hotel with a pretty good location. At the edge of the plaka and has good access to taxis, acropolis, plaka, temple of olympian zeus, etc. We opted for a view of the Temple for our room. I like rooms with views but it was that impressive. The room is decent size and clean. The bathroom has an odd shade to the shower from the bed area but I guess its fine for couples but not so much if you are with friends. Someone can easily plank you and pull up the shade since its outside of the shower itself.   This place has a weird elevator but maybe that is how many athens elevators are. It is rather slow and has a door that needs to be open. It is tricky to know when to actually open the door as there is no real indication that the elevator has stopped on your floor.…\n",

The walk is quite easy once you get your bearings right.  I asked a lady and she directed me alittle, thereafter it was just one straight road.  The road are cobbled on some parts, so do expect some difficulty in pulling your suitcase.  My room had a balcony facing the back streets and you can see other apartments and feels like a local.  Complimentary water provided and buffet breakfast was inclusive.  Good choice for buffet and the view of the Parthenon is amazing!  Loved it.  There fresh mint along the railings...so I picked some for my tea ;).  It’s really fragrant too.  Location is perfect to Plaka (old town),…\n",

I chose this hotel based on it's location--across the street from Hadrian's Gate & entrance to the Plaka/walk to Acropolis.  Clean & comfortable bed, A/C, olive oil bath & shower amenities, \"a room with a view\" (705) of the Temple of Zeus.  I stayed a week, there was a complimentary bottle of wine, peanuts, & raisins to greet me.  Rooftop wrap-around restaurant on roof has amazing views. Daily breakfast was amazing--yogurt, eggs, bacon, breads, fruit & veg & great coffee.   Athenians eat out quite late (9pm) & Iocation is so centrally located, I always felt safe walking back to the hotel on my own in the dark.  It was an absolute pleasure to stay here, an excellent experience.\n",

Tiny elevators but we never waited long since there were two.

Nice views of the Acropolis from upper rooms on the west side of the hotel as well as unobstructed views of Temple of Zeus and Hadrian's Arch from the rooms on the east side (which are right across the street).  Very friendly and helpful front desk staff.  Stored our luggage there early in the morning, walked around the city, came back to the hotel early afternoon and our luggage was waiting in our room.  Roof top restaurant has 360 views of the city (a bit sterile in ambiance).  Full breakfast is served.  Nice clean rooms.\n",

Dinner has a fixed menu and prices are higher than local restaurants. Most plates are from 15 to 25 euros. Elevators are small but they are reliable and work fast. Staff is friendly. Taxi charges 30 euros from the port to the hotel. BEWARE!!.. We reserved a taxi to take us to the airport, hotel staff told us it was 40 euros but the taxi driver charges 47 when we got to the airport because of \"some fees\", be careful. Hop on Hop off buses stops are 20 meters away from the hotel. Air conditioner was ok, it stopped the middle of the night. Would stay again. Any question, please feel free to ask!\n",

We stayed here multiple times in the past and spent two nights before leaving after a month in Greece.  Given the location, and the quality of the hotel, I think this is a very value and will continue to return the future.  It is not perfect, but there are easily hotels that are only slightly better for twice as much money per night.  They have a very good breakfast buffet, and again, the view from the rooftop deck cannot be beat. …\n",

Front desk amazing, help us with our delay luggage courtesy of IBERIA, they took care of calling and doing it all, thank you! Easy walk to everywhere  Will go back\n",

The rooms were nice and clean. The staff at check-in were friendly.  Walkable to the main attractions including shopping and cafes.  The only downside was that we got a room that faced the Zeus Temple but were able to hear the automobile traffic late into the night.  We are a family of 4 and they accommodated us with two adjoining rooms which was awesome.  Thumbs up.\n",

A metro station is a few minutes walk away.  The hotel is basic but very clean and comfortable.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  The view of the Acropolis from the roof garden is fabulous.  The breakfast was fresh and plentiful.  My minor gripe was that we only received one bottle of water for our whole stay.  I think for the price being charged per night fresh bottled water should be provided each day.

It's a great location just off the Plaka and the Acropolis area, and the rooftop breakfast area/restaurant/bar makes you feel as if you can reach out and touch the Parthenon. The hotel is very well equipped, up to date and clean, and the staff are always helpful as they can be. Especially if you're looking for a full-service, modern hotel, the Athens Gate is great. My only minor gripe (a weird one) is that to us there seem to be more Americans than any other nationality (which I am as well...), and the facilities definitely are catering to our tastes. I guess I may crave a bit more of an international feel these days.\n",

Opt for any room with a view if possible.   Decent, smallish sized lobby but comfortable seating areas.  Elevators for a hotel are some of the smallest we've seen (even throughout Europe).

All these are worth me staying again but in my experience this hotel shines because of the staff.

Our second floor room at the front overlooked the Temple of Zeus, and the rooftop restaurant gave us a stunning view of the Acropolis. There were eight lanes of traffic outside (this is the centre of Athens!), but the glazing meant we slept well and the air-con kept us comfortable. The new Acropolis Museum, metro, tavernas, bars and shops were all minutes away by foot, and further sites such as the Agora and National Archaeological museum were easily navigated and walk-able.  Staff were friendly and very helpful. We had an issue with the return shuttle to the airport, and we were most grateful to the receptionist who telephoned and resolved this for us.

The location is awesome only a few minutes walk to the Plaka area with all their great coffee shops & cafes & only about a 15 minute walk to the Acropolis. We had a fantastic room on the 7th floor with an amazing view of the Acropolis especially when it was lit up at night. We had a lovely breakfast each morning with views in their 8th floor restaurant. But unfortunately even though they had everything you would want for breakfast their hot food was always cold. It was such a shame as this spoilt our breakfast. But overall a great stay\n",

It is a great location and the roof top restaurant has spectacular vies of the acropolis, but that is it. The hallways and rooms were very drab and ancient looking. Even the doors to the rooms needed updating. There is no elevator. They have a \"lift\". The lift can only fit 4 people at a time and you are very squished in. There is no ventilation or air conditioning so it is very stuffy. The breakfast was just \"ok\". The sausages were horrible. Not sure what they were. In one of our rooms the air conditioning was not working well. My husband called the front desk and they told him they needed to turn it on. I have…\n",

The room was smaller than what you will be use to if you are expecting a typical North American room but for a European room it was spacious and comfortable.  The bed is on the small size of a queen and very very firm.   The balcony was very large with a table and chairs. It was a great place to spend some quiet time away from all the tourists. It does get sun all day so if you wanted to continue to work on your tan in a more quiet place it is perfect.

The room and shower (the Budget bedroom was small; the shower booth has no door so the floor in front of the sink gets very wet).  3. The room was clean, and was kept clean every day. No toothbrush and comb provided, but shampoo/conditioner/soap are replenished daily.  What I didn't like:  1. No instant coffee in the rooms (there was tea though). 2. The elevators.

The selection of food was absolutely excellent and the views are unforgettable.  This pretty much by itself makes this place worthy of a five star review.

Only one issue, the traffic it does not stop and is busy 24/7 if you are a light sleeper do not opt for a room with the view of Zeus, however for 3 nights it didn’t matter\n",

Rooms were spotless and spacious, with very comfortable beds and individually controlled air conditioning. Staff on reception and in the dining area could not have been more helpful, even though travel delays meant that we arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before it was due to close. Breakfasts offered a great choice.of good quality fare. Unfortunately we found the hotel very noisy, despite sound proofing and having a room at the side of the building. The traffic went on all night, and there was also loud conversation, probably from fellow guests, until about 3 a.m the first night.\n",

We had a superior room with  good views of the Temple of Zeus. Yes it is on a very busy and noisy road but it didn’t stop us from sleeping after a day of busy sightseeing! The rooftop bar and restaurant  has magnificent views of the Acropolis and  we were  fortunate to be able  to sit outside there each morning to eat our breakfast. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was included in the price and there was  always cheeese and cold meats, yogurt, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, scrambled and fried eggs and omelette to choose from. We would use this hotel again.\n",

The location is perfect just a short walk to the Acropolis, the Parthenon, Museum, Temple of Zeus, and Hadrian’s Arch.  The view from the rooftop restaurant is amazing.

We booked a budget room which was internal (a window but of the internal courtyard, no view) as we are very light sleepers.  This was perfect for us, and good value too.  Restaurant good.  Cocktails only ok but view wonderful so we didn't mind. Everyone was very helpful. The hotel is very clean. Bathroom nice and modern. Walking to all main attractions and near lovely Plaka area to walk around.  If we came to Athenss again we would stay here.  If you want to save money budget room does that and you have views of acropolis and temple of Zeus at breakfast.  Rooftop open all day.\n",

The Athens Gate is in an excellent, central location near the Plaka area making it in walking distance of all the main attractions. However, it is important to point out it is located next to a very, very busy road and traffic noise is an issue, even in February, so I should imagine as the weather improves during the year so will the noise. Rooms at the front of the hotel will be the most affected. Luckily we were at the side of the hotel and out of season, so noise didn't prove to be a huge issue for us. On arrival at the hotel we were met by a doorman John who couldn't do enough for us. Check in was smooth and efficient.

Room and corridors were clean. Rooftop restaurant offered an excellent breakfast. Close to many other restaurants and attractions..that is it.   However, I had forgotten my wallet on the bed in my room, and went back to get it, but did not find it.  Hotel management simply apologized. They simply believed the room maid's story. She denied seeing the wallet altogether. They told me they would let us know if they find it...it has been almost a year. I guess the 600.00 Euros were too enticing.\n",

We switched off the heat, however it was still way too hot even after a full day with heat off. The only way we were able to sleep was with the window open; however, there is a big trade off with that: traffic noise. The hotel is literally right next to a very busy street, and if you have a room with a view of Temple of Zeus like we had, you are going to have a feeling that you are sleeping on the street because of the noise.

The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and tidy, and the bar and restaurant offer good food and drink. Everything you want from a hotel.

Couldn't find any room service menu, but there were plenty of good eating places nearby. A short 10mins walk to the Metro, 5mins walk to nearest convenience shop. If noise isn't your concern, I recommend this.\n",

      "Review is :Tip: If you are a light sleeper, sleep in a cold room or require fast wifi, I would not recommend to stay here.  We booked a 4 night stay here to do some sightseeing in Athens and picked it for its centrally located location. Check-in was a breeze and was formally welcomed and personally shown to our room which we loved. We opted in for a temple of Zeus view room and got one on the 6th floor. While the view was great, the amount of noise coming from the street below was extraordinary! Noise was significant from cars and constant honking every hour of the day including after-hours even with the door closed. This was detrimental to our sleep quality. In addition, the rooms are quite stuffy and the heat/cool system was centrally controlled. The WiFi was terribly slow and took…\n",

Given that we were a family of 5, the hotel was accommodating to our requests in putting the rooms near each other as well as other location.  I am most THANKFUL for the hotel for finding a precious piece of jewelry that my wife had left in the room after we checked out. This would have a made a big difference in our trip and i would like to applaud the hotel for making our holiday in Greece even more memorable!\n",

The 360degrees view of Acropolis, temple of Zeus and mount lycabettus is probably the best in the Athens city center. Other than that, the staff were always helpful too and accomodating. We were offered plenty of help, advice and on our last day when we had to catch an early morning flight to Santorini, we had a 4.30am wake up, taxi booked and ready at 5am and 2 breakfast boxes for us.

Quieter location and close to so many restaurants of all types, the main Plaka shopping streets, Acropolis, a mini mart around the corner.  Walked everywhere, or very low cost cab fare if we got tired of walking!  Never had a need for the metro or bus or tram though they’re all nearby.   We had a 7th floor terrace room facing the Acropolis, for 7 nights, amazing to see that view every night lit up and in the morning.  I imagine the Temple of Zeus side could be just as nice, just different, more mountains less rooftops, but no idea if street noise would be an issue.

The room we stayed in had a stunning view but was tired.   Be mindful the hotel is on a very busy road making the balcony unusable due to the noise and fumes.

We stayed on the 7th floor overlooking the Acropolis. The view was exquisite! We ordered room service for dinner, and the food was so delicious! We had to check out very early in the morning to catch our flights, so we were going to miss the breakfast buffet, so the staff arranged to have breakfast bags ready for our departure, complete with sandwiches, fruit, cake, and juice!

Check in and go straight up to the roof garden (where the restaurant is) and look directly into the Acropolis and the Agora. City bus tour stops within 50 m and great local restaurants by the hundreds down little winding alleys. Just tops!  Only one drawback we felt was having room 115, just above the entrance and very close to noisy motorbikes (so ask for a high floor!). Food is ok, though evening menu limited (though \"classy\").

Situated within walking distance of most of the major monuments and museums, and plenty of darling restaurants, tavernas, bars, and shopping, we couldn’t be happier! The room is clean, comfortable, modern. Large bathroom with slate shower which also has a window where you can gaze at the Parthenon while soaping up!

      "Review is :The Athens Gate is close to the main historic and tourist centre, including the Acropolis.  Just a 5 minute walk to be in the thick of it.  The hotel is clean, today and.... functional.  There aren't too many frills, but the roof-top restarant/bar is small but superb with great views of the ancient sites.  The Wifi was really slow and unreliable during my stay.  350 kb/s on a good day.  The road to the front is noisy almost 24 hours a day and the windows do little to reduce this, even on the 5th floor.  So you will experience whacky races a lot of the time.  The room doors are made of noise transparent paper which and allows everybody to generously share in the normal hotel corridor noise, including the ancient lift door and cleaner's plastic bag rustling.  It's clean and the…\n",

Nice modern bathroom with great walk in shower.  The restaurant on the roof has absolutely magnificent views of the ocean, the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus - honestly I don't know how you could find a better view.  Food was good, breakfast included.  No freshly cooked eggs (in the heat up dishes) but it was good.  On the downside, keeping it from 5 stars, is 2 things.  The more serious one is that the wifi was completely useless.  We honestly could never do anything online. Not sure if it was the location of the room or what but it's too major of a city and new of a hotel to have such terrible wifi.  Second and particular to us, we went to…\n",

(May need to bring own hair dryer as one supplied is a mini wall dryer) I know this may not be the first thing most people would write about but the room maids were excellent, plus bed turn down service with sweets left on bed.

The rooftop restaurant (where breakfast is served) has an unbelievable view of the Acropolis. Multiple good restaurants within 5 to 10 minute walk.The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The downside is that the hotel is right on a very busy, very noisy roadway. Think large trucks, tour buses and motorcycle noise. We slept fine, tired from travel, but if you are a light sleeper, could be a significant problem for you. Estimate that half of the rooms are directly on the street so can't count on getting a quiet room.\n",

Delicious food at the restaurant and at breakfast. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Room is nice. The only negative comment I can come up with is that the air conditioner turns off when you’re not in your room with the key in the slot inside, so it is hot when you return to your room from a hot day in the summer. But I think that is pretty common in Greece. This hotel is within walking distance to everything we went to. Close to Acropolis, and Agora. We even ventured a little farther to the National Archaelogical Museum, and it was do-able. Wear good walking shoes and you can walk anywhere!\n",

Breakfast served aloft is moderate but rich in variety and generous besides the amazing close view of the Akropolis that you dont get to see elsewhere as closely. If you are on a business travel or looking for a good hotel with a solid service, this hotel is the right choice due to its location at a 10-15' walking distance from Syntagma and room rates are very reasonable depending on season.\n",

The staff are friendly and very helpful. The beds are comfortable and the air conditioning effective and quiet. The breakfast, on the aforementioned terrace, is magnificent and really sets you up for the day.\n",

      "Review is :The Athens Gate Hotel is a wonderful place to stay while in Athens.  We have stayed there for two years now and will stay again in 2018.  We have stayed in a 7th floor room with Acropolis view.  It has a very large terrace, which is a wonderful place to sit and soak up the sun and the view.  The staff throughout the hotel are really great!  I highly recommend the Athens Gate if you are looking for a fantastic experience while in Greece!!\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is in an ideal location: walking distance to major sites (Acropolis, new museum, temple of Zeus, national garden, etc), areas (Plaka, Monastiraki square, metro, and within walking distance of tons of restaurants. Breakfast was included and was ok. The best thing about breakfast was the amazing views of either the Acropolis or the Temple of Zeus before getting your day started. The restaurant's service was a bit slow since they often seemed to be under staffed. I would not recommend dinner/lunch there since prices were a bit steep. Opt for a coffee or some drinks if you want to go to roof top in the evening during sunset. Staff was very friendly, but wish they would have been more attentive to us since they knew we were on our honeymoon. If you book a superior room with…\n",

You can walk to the top of the Acropolis in about 15 minutes.  The rooms are large and clean. The bathrooms are modern and clean. The entire hotel looks like it was recently remodel.  The staff was great and spoke English. Would definitely stay here again.   The breakfast on the terrace with a view of the Acropolis was unforgettable.\n",

It was very easy to walk to the hotel from the public transport.  It was also easy to walk to all restaurants and monuments.    The food was amazing!  Breakfast is not to be missed and dinner was great!  Make a reservation for dinner if you want to sit outside.  The service was impeccable.

Roof top pool, bar and restaurant excellent a bit pricey but you are in a major city. Fantastic restaurant straight across the road the moussaka is out of this world. Travelling round the city is easy if you use the tube which is literally just round the corner. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, great hotel in a fantastic city.

      "Review is :First this 5 stars hotel located in a street with homeless, junkies and apartments with lights for hookers. Bad neighbourhood.When we arrived the woman in the front desk said they have a pluming problem, just to the few who came from Israel and send us to an apartment hotel which we gave them only 3 stars but we were tired and slept there. In the morning we ask to come back, they said they will try, with a lot of come back we got angry so they gave us all a room. The room was o.k. except the coffee did not work and after 3 times we ask them to change/fix it -we gave up.And lost-we ask them a late check out because of our flight and because we felt they lie to us when we arrived and they refused.\n",

      "Review is :Plus points first- The hotel is very good, modern and well decorated. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The lifts have smart pads! Never seen this b4! The rooms are of good quality large bathrooms (very leaky showers) The beds/pillows are soooo comfy and linen of excellent quality. There is a fridge, coffee machine (only 4 free pods, have to pay for more) a kettle with tea, coffee, milk etc. A hairdryer, bathroom scales?? Random! Great quality bath sheets, hand towels and face cloth provided. A safe, plenty of storage with lots of hangers and plenty of plug sockets. Even one in the huge mirror! The rooftop bar/restaurant and pool are excellent and huge! The breakfast is plentiful and good quality. Great view of the acropolis! Lots of fresh clean pool towels provided, the beds a not very comfy but a great sun trap and very sheltered. There is also a very good quality shower and toilet facility available. We had time to kill on our last day so we stored our luggage at reception and sat round the pool and used the showers and changing room to get ready for our flight in the evening. It saved us having to pay for late checkout. The hop on hop off city sightseeing bus stops outside the hotel on the roundabout and the metaxourghio metro station is also opposite the hotel. There are only 3 lines and it is very easy to get to/from the airport for €9 a single ticket or €50 for taxi or €55 hotel transfer. You get the metro metaxourghio (red line) to syntagma (blue line) change here! And the blue line goes all the way to the airport and takes about 40-45 mins while journey. (Very well signposted)  There are 2 restaurants outside the entrance to the hotel which look like they might not be great but we’re excellent and cheap.  We were given a bottle of bubbly and a beautiful cake for my birthday in our room and we ate and drank it on the rooftop one evening.  There is a little kiosk outside the hotel selling snacks, drinks etc very very cheap. There is also a cafe bakery opposite.  Negative points- the hotel is in a very dodgy area and although it is actually not far walking distance to Psiri and Plaka (main places to eat/drink) it is not safe to walk at night. It doesn’t matter which way you navigate your way back it’s extremely scary!Take a taxi! There are plenty of them and they are cheap! If you do want to run the gauntlet then don’t wear your valuables or have your phone on show!  The showers are very badly designed and flood the bathroom floor.  The tea/coffee/milk supply in the room is limited so stock up at breakfast or ask on reception for more.  The walls between rooms are thin and you can hear your neighbours very well. The city view rooms aren’t great as the surrounding area is very rundown so not a good view and very noisy at lower levels with the traffic. The pool area isn’t very large so beds are limited and the sun doesn’t hit the beds on the bar side until about 2pm and the pool is not heated brrrrrrrr!  The hotel holds a lot of conferences so the rooftop is used a fair bit and the restaurant is closed off for these events. However you can still sit in some areas and use the bar. The prices in the bar are very expensive! You can buy your own drinks and food and use the rooftop areas.  The roads and pavements are very dangerous there are trip hazards everywhere and the graffiti on absolutely everything is appalling.  The surrounding areas of the hotel are dirty and an assault on the senses. Be careful not to tread on the used hyper dermic needles! Drug abuse, self harm, beggars and rough sleepers is very prevalent here. I’ve seen things I can’t erase from my memory unfortunately.  There are many tickets for the different archeological sites but we got the €30 ticket for 7 sites which is valid for 8 days it was worth it. The signage for the different sites is useless and the staff at ticket offices are rude, unhelpful and not at all happy about their employment! The riviera is fabulous and very close but they all seem to have beach clubs which you pay an entrance fee and then for your beds, however the facilities are clean and tidy.  4 nights is enough in this city but if you are staying longer I would recommend getting the ferry to one of the small islands off Athens for a couple of days.  Athens airport is rubbish! Not much there so take something to read or watch if you are spending any time there.  I loved Athens in 6 days I walked 43 miles and did 103,000 steps!…\n",

      "Review is :I was a little aprehensive before arrival as I kept reading bad reviews for this hotel. However, they are wildly exaggerated: the hotel is really good! The location is probably mixed: really close to transport and to the main sites but the area surrounding the hotel can be a little scary after dark. Inside, reception is sort of tucked into a corner and vast areas of the lobby seem to be not used (although anyone can go and sit in them). Our room was a little on the small size - we booked for 3 people, 2 adults and a 13-year old and while it did have an extra bed, the placement meant that it blocked the opening for the closet. It wasn't great but we managed to put up with this for a whole week and otherwise, the room was really good. The rooftop bar and pool are the best part and definitely recommend those. Service was also excellent and while there were a few maintenance issues evident these were small and not affected our trip. …\n",

      "Review is :Booked this hotel as a Traveller’s Choice for 2022. Very disappointed, certainly not 5 star.   I emailed for a hotel transfer as this is offered. I heard nothing after a week and had to chase the hotel the day before. No apology received so I decided to organise my own transport.   My room had paper thin walls and I could hear snoring, TV etc., next door. I complained and was told to come back in an hour, which I did. I was then told a manager hadn’t yet arrived and to come back again later, which I did. I was then moved, but to another twin room when I had specifically asked for quiet.   After further complaint I was finally given a room where I was able to sleep. However, this ordeal should not have interrupted my day three times. It should have been resolved instantly.   The three rooms I saw all required attention to detail. Scuffs, dents and watermarks, curtains not fully closing, dirty grout etc. It’s the aggregation of ‘little things’.   The breakfast buffet is half decent, one redeeming grace, and there is a small pool on the 9th floor, but it can be difficult finding a free lounger.   The best thing about this hotel is probably the elevators, four all working at once.…\n",

      "Review is :We arrived expecting a 5 star experience an were met with a 3 star experience at best.   1. There was no attendant to help with the bags  2. Our floor smelled like garbage and our room smelled like it was pier fumes to mask a horrid smell.   3. The carpet was dated and stained in multiple areas   4. The surfaces in the room were covered in dust and there was someone’s hair in the bathroom.   5. The furniture was also stained.   6. Chipped paint on the walls   We cleaned the shower ourselves as we had been traveling for hours and just needed to shower. Afterwards, we head down to the front desk to change rooms and there response to everything above was you’ve been here for an hour, at which point I said I’d be happy to provide images with a time stamp and that does not change the fact that the entire floor smelled like garbage.  We understand that things happen but the service and expectation of 5 star this is not.  Ultimately they did change our room. However, my review still stands. Needs an update to call itself a 5 star hotel.…\n",

From the smooth check-in process in the large, air-conditioned reception to the check-out process - perfect. Our room on the 7th floor had a partial acropolis view.  Room was spacious with all the usual facilities including a decent sized fridge, bathroom also was large, well equipped, with a large and powerful walk-in shower. Highlight of the room was the King size bed which had just the right degree of firmness and support to recover from all the walking around the beautiful city of Athens. Breakfast was served from 7.00 am on the top (9th) floor and consisted of cooked, continental, yoghurt and fresh fruit.  In fact, it had virtually every option to suit taste…\n",

We often stayed at Brigham hotels so we knew the high quality of their facilities and services.  We had selected the best room with a view of the Acropolis.   The room had a very narrow table attached to the wall, 2 hard chairs, an espresso machine and a bottle of water.   We enjoyed our coffee the next morning and used the bottled water for it. When we returned at the end of the day, there was no water nor coffee pods and the room was not made. We had to request coffee pods, water and have the room made up everyday.

      "Review is :The Wyndham Grand Athens is an “okay” hotel. The location isn’t exactly “prime”. There wasn’t much shopping or restaurants near by within a few blocks radius. We were only staying for one night, before our cruise so we didn’t have much time to explore the area as much. The hotel itself is nice, recently renovated. The room itself was just okay. The room needed more lights, it was too dark. The furniture felt to look cheap and dirty. It did not feel luxurious at all. The bathroom also needed work. There needs to be more lights, and they need to clean up the shower floor. There was lots of grout. The breakfast was amazing. It was on the rooftop bar overlooking Athens and the Acropolis. The breakfast had fresh breads, meats, cereals, fruit and drinks. Although the hotel itself was…\n",

The hotel is in the middle of downtown - but not so close to Plaka .  But easy access to Metro and sightseeing bus   The surroundings here is Not so nice to walk - especially in the evening - we were recommended to take cabs and watch out our belongings.  criminals and drug addicted in this  area which already  look miserable with graffiti mess overall .   It’s a shame that  downtown Athens is so  covered with messy graffiti  in the walls , doors , signs … everywhere😕 - one driver told us that it happens during the protests in town . If the owners paint it , the protest will do it again .\n",

The staff was rude and uninformed. We had to ask for towels 3 times. The phone would not call any of the pre dialed numbers. The worse experience I had the whole trip.

It ticks the boxes and qualifies. That said, their “affordable luxury” motto has the interpretive ambiguity of any utterance by the Delphic Oracle.  With its interior courtyard/atrium, large reception desk, concierge area, and distinct tour assistance desk, the hotel looks like a Hyatt of a certain vintage. The lobby is spacious but could stand to be brightened up. The furniture is dated and dull. There seems to be parking and various business/meeting (wedding) rooms and venues. On the 8th floor, there is a gym and spa, neither of which we even looked at. To me, the absolutely outstanding feature of…\n",

Separate bath and shower, the shower had the biggest shower head I have ever seen, which was far to big for the shower cubicle and made showering an unpleasant experience.  Breakfast wasn't that good, the first morning tables and chairs had crumbs all over them, and we got there just after opening. Poor pastry selection, bread was stale.

The 'hot' food was luke warm but there was plenty of choice for cereals and fruit etc. Getting a free table was a bit of a task as tables were not being cleared quick enough.

Breakfast would be nice if you stuck to continental options, cooked breakfast was awful.

      "Review is :The hotel itself is fine but the noise cancellation in the room is very poor. It's very easy to hear noises from outside, either inside or outside of the hotel. There could be  more wall hooks, drawers, etc to store or hang clothes, jackets.   Since wearing a mask is still required in Greece, the hotel staff is obligated to inform the clients to follow the rules, especially at breakfast when it's self service. It would reduce much more chaos if the restaurant staff could lead the guests to a suitbale table instead of letting them find themself a table.  The spa is good, at least.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the Wyndham for four nights. The room was very nice except for the traffic on the square but that’s not the hotel’s fault. When you stay in a big city that is somehow to be expected. I was however surprised that in a five star hotel you only receive one coffee capsule per person in the room for the whole stay. That is somehow quite below the expectation. Then the breakfast was an additional charge of 18€ per person that I am happy to pay as long as it is clean, offers a proper variety and is managed by a friendly staff. The first problem was that the crew seemed totally overwhelmed when there were more people there. Glasses ran out and so did all the juices. All other items were regularly filled up.,Although most staff was very friendly, one lady who seemed to be…\n",

The rooftop bar is incredible too - amazing views of the Acropolis and of the city, and the cocktails were very high quality (and I know my cocktails!). You must spend an evening at the bar - particularly during ‘golden hour’ (just before sunset) when everything looks extra beautiful!   I had a fantastic massage at the spa, by the amazing team Giorges and Marcha. The facilities were beautiful and they were both so knowledgeable and skilled. They were super friendly and flexible too. They really made the experience. Highly recommend!  The hotel is close to main attractions (walking distance to vibrant neighbourhoods and bars and restaurants) and has great metro links too. You have to be a little careful…\n",

I had some lower back pain and Martha identified it immediately and give me some fantastic advice for it.

I booked with Tui and in their description of it being central and a short distance from main areas implied you could walk and enjoy the city.  This is absolutely not advised.  I travelled alone with my son and the area did not feel safe and was not pleasant.  There is a brothel a street away, drug addicts are apparent.  We took taxi’s to get everywhere and even the drivers told us to be aware of our surroundings. We booked another hotel as a result out of our own pocket to enjoy the last half of our holiday. Please note I am not a pathetic female thinking everything should be perfect……but this was our holiday and it was not !\n",

The roof top bar was excellent with great cocktails and a fabulous view. Breakfast was very good, with plenty of choice. It is a couple of minutes from the metro, or a 15 minute walk into the centre of Athens, however it is not located in the nicest of areas - some of the nearby streets felt a bid dodgy with red lights........ The only downside in the hotel was the shower - the shower head was huge, as big as the shower cubicle, so it felt as though you were under a waterfall. There was a charge of €1.50 per nespresso capsule for the coffee machine and a free bottle of mineral water, but only on the first day - a bit tight fisted for a luxury…\n",

I came back at 8 pm; opened the safe box and there was my money stolen from the SAFEBOX that should be secured. I went down to the reception to claim that an incident happened and they contacted the manager and we went through the investigation 3 hours and checked the camera and saw that a crew at 10.30 am entered my room to clean it. I asked for clarification and they told me that the manager is not on duty and I should wait for tomorrow.

My experience at the Whyndom Grand Athens exceeded all my previous hotel experiences and my expectations on all levels, the experience has been absolutely amazing. The staff was friendly, professional and extremely helpful. They make you feel at home and go the extra way to make sure your stay is comfortable, enjoyable and as pleasant as possible. Stratula especially was extremely helpful in offering needed information that was required for my next trip accomodations at 2 locations. I have not experienced this type of support and service before. She went beyond what was expected that saved lots of time…\n",

Have to say definitely not a 5* hotel that’s for sure maybe a 4* if that. We were booked into a superior room I would hate to see what a standard room looked like, however the bed was comfortable. Maid service wasn’t all that good dirty glasses and cups were left in room floors looked liked hadn’t been cleaned properly, a few times bed wasn’t made properly had to do it ourselves. Not good for a so called 5* hotel. Breakfast was average orange juice was like water most of the time god knows what they done with it and couple of the staff were lacking in manners, Bar staff in the evening up on the roof top were exceptional especially Demitrios couldn’t do…\n",

Cant swim and enjoy; - do not provide daily water, tea or coffee. Only 1 time (which is weird for 5 stars hotel)....   Does not have 5 stars feeling. I would choose other hotels closer to the historical sides (4 stars).\n",

Breakfast variety was good but during covid times all 5 star hotels are now serving the buffet themselves behind glass. Here the guests were offered gloves but were not all using them. Some guests would come without masks and it would be quite crowded at times. The hotel staff should have told them to wear it when getting their food.  As for the location, yes it is near a metro station and taxis are all around but we did not want to use the metro, we wanted to walk in the evening when it was cooler. The area was very scary at night with lots of beggars and drug dealers. They even came up to us while we were sitting in the restaurant outside the hotel.…\n",

The first man mentioned how his shower wasn’t working and the other customer said how her stay had not been as nice as the previous time due to the difficulty of getting served by the restaurant staff. From this I did wonder if choosing Wyndham Grand Athens was going to be a big mistake for our 6 night stay.  Over the course of our time there, the restaurant staff tried their best. And in my opinion they were just extremely short staffed for the amount of work they had to do. For example, the breakfast was served there, any refreshments, bites for lunch and dinner.

Luckily I knew many of the staff as they usually work at the Residence so that made my stay much more pleasant and the manger from there, Magna, was on duty in the Grand so it was almost like being in my home away from home.  The rooms at the Grand are, in my opinion,  not as good as the ones in the Residence but they are still top class. Because of the virus I was unable to benefit from the full menu at the Grand but what was provided was excellent anyway.  I am luckily enough travelling to Athens again soon do either hotel would be great but to me if I get to stay at the Residence it will be a bonus.\n",

It’s so nice to see the same faces every time I come.   My group enjoyed cocktails every evening at the beautiful rooftop bar. The view of the Acropolis at night is breathtaking.  The rooms are clean, spacious and well-appointed. Having a coffee/espresso maker in the room is a bonus!  The location is great- I walked each day on each of my visits to Plaka, the Acropolis and Monistiraki Square. Athens is a walker’s paradise.

The coffee was excellent. Not in the best part of town however.  And for some reason, the shower was devoid of shelves for soap and shampoo.  Very odd.  Good value for the money.

She took the time to make our bookings for Ferry rides to various islands, guide us on the best restaurants in Athens and even got us a hotel on other Greece island locations... Amazing to see this level of customer service! Above all her friendly nature and smile takes away any anxiety you might have if you came with limited  planning ;)\n",

      "Review is :I stayed at this hotel because the Wyndahm Residence next door decided to be closed for repairs. The rooms are quite modern and spacious, but a lot of details weren't right. I had a dirty cloth from housekeeping and half used shampoo bottles instead of new ones in the bathroom and used coffee capsulses from the guests before in the coffee machine whilst somedays the trash didn't get emptied, asf. And there's a roughly 1-2 cm gap under the room door and the connecting door to the next room, I did hear everything happening outside in the hallway as well as in the next room. And the windows are really bad so it's noisy all night from the street and I could hear pedestrians talking even though i was on the 5th floor.

Plenty of taxis, with the hop on n hop off bus stopping just in front of the hotel. Ms. Angie who checked us in is super friendly and full of information about the hotel, city and best options to choose from. Maria the hostess at the breakfast restaurant is very professional and does a great job in greeting and seating guests and also helps with breakfast service. The buffet breakfast we had on the roof top garden terrace is among the best we have had in any 5 star hotel - it’s top notch 👌. Overall visiting Athens has been a great and unforgettable experience a must do destination atleast once in your life time . 🤝😁\n",

Very good location, directly in front of the metro and only a few stops to all the main sights, also easy to get to from the airport.   I did not feel unsafe in the area, there are lots of hotels  There is a good cafe selling pastry and cake over the road so there’s lots of options if you do not want to pay for breakfast in the hotel   Staff were friendly and helpful  The view from the rooftop bar is amazing, they also have good selection of drinks and cocktails\n",

The restaurant is far too pricey and the food is pretentious. Just try not to mix everything with pasta to sound fancy. Also, small plates. I was still hungry.

The hotel is nicely renovated and rooms are clean and have everything you need. Adding it all up, it is a great choice for a short stay in Athens.

The hotel is not located in the tourist district or city center.

However there are some issues that we didn't know about:  First off, multiple locals told us that the location was not the safest after dark. It wasn't a big problem but they told us to not walk around at night and to just take a cab.  Second, the pool is much smaller than it looks. There are limited chairs available and it is deceptively smaller than the photos. In the 4 days we stayed, we couldn't get a spot by the pool at all.  Third, every morning we were woken up by screaming children. Not the best if you want a quiet get away.  Although I will say, the restaurant and bar was great and has a great view.

I had to call three times before someone picked up and once the food arrived I wished I never ordered. I was told the wrong floor to locate the business center.   The star of the show was Alex who drove the hotel shuttle.  He picked us up from the airport and gave us his tips for success in Athens. 1) Sunscreen at all times; 2) keep a water bottle on you at all times; 3) ladies - skip the heels and make up.   Bottom Line - Alex deserves 5 stars. I wish the other hotel staff could have had his enthusiasm. The bellhop was nice as well - I did not get his name. Everything else at the hotel was just average.\n",

Looking at the Akropolis from your bed is just amazing.  - Good quality rooms - Pool: although small, it was still a welcome thing to do after a day in the heat of Athens - Friendly staff  What I didn't like: - Breakfast area is too small for the number of guests\n",

The staff is warm and welcoming and the food is full of flavors for every palate.

Excellent views of the Acropolis from the roof bar, the roof top pool is small (as you would expect from any roof top pool) and the breakfast is standard (but good). The only major negative is the area. You have to get cabs everywhere, as there are a lot of undesirables - one older guest told us that he was chased back to the hotel for his mobile phone. There are also a lot of beggars around the nearby metro. Restaurant selections are also limited in the area.\n",

There is a rooftop pool and it felt very refreshing after a long day in the heat; however, it appears that they favored more restaurant space over pool deck space and it feels kind of cramped up there.  The rooms were clean but housekeeping didn't come until we were already back at our rooms for the day (after 5). That being said the decor was nice and the bed was comfortable!

      "Review is :We came here after a blissful week in Santorini, where the views and service were the best we had had. We realized in coming to Athens that our experience would not be the same, but we didn’t expect this. While the hotel has a lovely restaurant across the street, the building itself is dismal, dirty and old. We checked in after a long ferry ride and our view outside consisted of terribly run down buildings almost close enough that we could touch them and the people across the way. We don’t usually complain but we asked for a different room. While they obliged, they explained this was the “room I had chosen.” I’m not sure anyone would choose that room if they understood what they were going to experience. After we switched rooms, we decided we would try the rooftop restaurant. It…\n",

Not one main reason for that, some of the things that struck us negatively were the moderate maintenance of the building, the crappy service at the pool (just go inside and order at the bar, in all the hours we spent there no one came out to take anyones order) and the outright ridiculously high prices of the bar and minibar. We paid €8 for a paper cup of orange juice at the pool. For a can of Coca Cola (330ml) in the minibar they charge a whooping €6. We get that this is no 3* hotel but these prices are outrageous. That being said, it would flatter the hotel if they offered the minibar complimentary as we paid well over…\n",

      "Review is :I stayed here very recently and was mostly pleased with our stay. Really the only reason for not giving this hotel a 5 star review was the bathroom. The shower was open on one end and the drain didn't really drain very well so we ended up with a pool of water in the bathroom every time we took a shower. It actually got bad enough to seep through to the other side of the wall and into the hallway. We notified maintenance and they definitely sent someone to address it. It got much better but I think a more involved fix is in order.  Unfortunately, likely because of this leaking our room had a slight mildewy smell. Thankfully, it wasn't overwhelming or overpowering; but it was there.  The room really was lovely. The beds were comfy and the pillows are amazing. I'm a little bit of a…\n",

Fact is that it was a let down to experience the Wyndham - we had to request a room change after the first night due to a shower that wouldn’t stop dripping and a WiFi network that didn’t work (room 560) we were helped quite nicely by Christina in the reception and this worked just fine - room was clean - functional etc. but it is a chain hotel and you feel it no real personality or extraordinarily feel to it - seems like a transit camp for American cruise ships. What pulls down was the quality of the food we had both room service and the breakfast was not on a level of a 4 star hotel by any stretch - overall disappointing but helped by the Greek staff…\n",

We poured through hotel listings and finally chose Wyndham Grand Athens that boasted views of the acropolis. We booked 2 Executive rooms “city view” in November. We arrived exhausted from jet lag having been awake 26 hrs. The first betrayal - WE ARE NOT IN THE HOTEL WE BOOKED but rather in their sister Hotel “Wyndham Residence.” Second Betrayal We get in the room (after I paid for 10 days in advance) and the view is the back service area not the city view I paid for. When I spoke to the front desk at Wyndham Residence she said no executive city view rooms were available. So I asked for a refund of the difference in price for the standard atrium view they gave me but was denied. Had I not been so exhausted…\n",

Breakfast was supposed to be until 10:30, and at 10:15 they were out of pancakes, my daughter wanted and they told us they couldn’t bring them because it was about to close so we told them they were supposed to close until 10:30 and they agree to serve them.

There is also a metro station very close, which is good if you're getting the train to/from the airport. First impressions were very good, my room was a very good size, nothing to complain about at all there. The breakfast is on the top floor where there is an amazing view over Athens. There are lots of cold options as well as cooked. Again, no complaints with the breakfast. The gym is very small, just two treadmills, an elliptical machine and a bike. There also isn't much space for weights or stretching etc. It was also very warm, even very early in the morning. The AC didn't seem to do much either. Not a deal breaker but…\n",

Very close to a metro stop, a 24-hour HUGE bakery/dinner/cake place and security at the hotel 24-7. We will definitely choose Wyndham Athens for any future Athens trips!

While the Wyndham Grand Athens isn't located next to the Acropolis, the vista you have from the mouth-watering buffet breakfast every morning is absolutely incredible. The front desk staff and concierge were also extremely helpful-- everyone went above and beyond to help us! The only downside to the hotel (which can be easily remedied by affordable Uber or cab rides) is that it's not right next to the main sites-- but it's a 7-10 min car ride, which we found to be worth it for the money we saved staying away from the main drag. Highly recommend-- and don't skip breakfast!\n",

The room is modern and with all the facilities one would expect in a 5* luxury hotel with the added addition of a Illy coffee machine (my favourite coffee). The room 816 is located on the City side but the room is well insulated so there is little traffic noise to disturb sleep. Air conditioning is excellent and again practically noiseless.  Beds are super comfortable and we have slept well.  This hotel has a fabulous roof top terrace, restaurant, bar and pool with views over the Acropolis and Lycabettus.

But you do need to be aware that it is not the best area to walk through even though my husband was more put off than I was. You will find the usual graffiti, some needles lying around (no panic, please! ) but the square is brilliant! So be aware of your surroundings but do it!

DO NOT stay in summer I had to request for my AC to be tuned on daily and it does not get cold - mildly cool. Same with the fridge - you will not make use of the bar fridge as everything is luke warm Cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired - my coffee machine was not cleaned until I requested. My bathroom vanity was not cleaned for 3 days. The spa is a converted hotel room - TINY - and not private at all every conversation can be heard when you are…\n",

      "Review is :Perfect hotel with amazing and professional service in Athens.  I was upgraded to the Acropolis view room and it was so amazing, especially at night when the lights go on. The hotel and room were very clean and smelled good. Room was modern with full size bathroom and great amenities. The bed was very comfortable with great beddings.  Service was friendly and attentive. They delivered what they promised, even on small things like calling me back when my room is ready, which sadly a lot of other hotels failed.  The breakfast was decent but there was virtually no service. No one offered coffee or juice or made to order eggs. Also given that it was Greece, I could not find any yogurt. These are of course small kinks but no way were issues.  The area around the hotel can looks scary…\n",

Nonetheless, when the Parthenon is lit up at night it is wonderful. The included breakfast buffet is served in a patio restaurant with an amazing view of Athens facing the ocean. We were astonished every morning at the view and enjoyed great food. The neighborhood is mixed. Not a place to go shopping or out to eat, but only a 15-minute walk from the Plaka marketplace, Mostraki market, and 30 min to walk to the Parthenon. Don't miss the Acropolis Museum.\n",

All the staff throughout our entire stay were lovely, without being irritatingly sycophantic as can sometimes happen. They were down to earth but wanted us to have the best stay possible for our wedding anniversary. To that end, they made sure we had a stunning view from our room - none other than the Acropolis itself. I would strongly recommend the Wyndham Grand to anyone. The area of the city itself is not the most scenic, but it's easy to imagine this hotel spurring a regeneration/gentrification of the local area. Transport links are fantastic (right next door to the Metro) and the breakfast caters to all tastes.\n",

Though this is my first time booking with this group of hotels they have upgraded me to a better room. I didn’t have breakfast there so I am not sure how it is. I liked the room. When I gave my feedback in the hotels.com that the room is noisy they immediately contacted me and offered to change it to a quieter room. Which is very much appreciated. Station near the hotel has no elevator or escalator. There are so many stairs. As I took trains (there is no direct train or bus) from the airport I felt it difficult to exit the station with 2 bags.

I’d write a letter or speak to a manager but general attitude here is no one can be bothered, no one cares...  We arrived during a the end of a conference and went to check in - no queues at reception. However, reception were not what I would call welcoming and seemed more interesting in helping conference partakers who were pushing in front of me and my colleague asking questions or for taxis. Rather than asking my colleague and I to take a seat so they could deal with the onslaught, they allowed us to be barged in front of at the reception desk and really slow down…\n",

Nevertheless, the area in between the hotel and the tourist center is very run down with lots of brothels and abandoned houses. Better to take the metro which is right outside the hotel.

Cool roof-top bar with a pool and amazing views of the Acropolis, my 16 year old felt on top of the world and very grown-up!

When we arrived we explained that the transfer taxi we had pre-arranged with the hotel was not at the airport when we arrived. Angie went out of her way to find out what had happened and arranged for our return transfer to the airport free of charge as a result of the inconvenience. This was greatly appreciated.  The breakfast was delicious and there was a huge variety of food.  Our only problem was the location. It seemed to be on the seedier side of town and we were not adventurous enough to venture out at night on foot in that area.\n",

Not very impressed by the staff at reception, we were welcomed by a trainee who asked us to pay 4EUR city tax before check in, we gave 20EUR but she didnt accept it because of 'no change' (she could have had a look for change somewhere, Im sure) - instead she blocked 50EUR from our card (we could have had to pay commissions to our bank) as security deposit. She insisted for us to spend this money either on room minibar or restaurant. In the meantime we asked the relations manager to book us a table in a restaurant I knew, she lazily called and said no one would pick up and again suggested us to go to the hotel's restaurant.

Whilst the metro/underground is walking distance and in my opinion, very safe to use, the location of the hotel is less desirable.  I walked to Psiri with my friend who comes from Athens but lives in London.  The walk took us from the hotel through some rather unsafe areas....a taxi would be my suggestion. On a brighter note, the staff are so helpful, the breakfast was sumptuous and the caviar facial I had at the spa was the best! I would only wish that the roof top pool opened before 11am as my last day I had planned to enjoy the early morning sun and have a dip.\n",

      "Review is :Booked an executive room with breakfast. Room and breakfast have both been very good. The views from the roof terrace are very good. The restaurant on the roof top charges extortionate prices in comparison to the rest of Athens even with similar views. The only 2 let downs in this hotel, are the area and the size of the pool!  The area surrounding the hotel is not the safest according to taxi drivers and others and we witnessed some of this ourselves. The pool size is very small with limited sun beds so you have to act fast in the mornings to ensure a bed. Other than these two, it really is a fabulous hotel with kind and helpful staff working here. However, I would definitely recommend staying here as taxis are cheap and you can work with the pool.\n",

The hotel itself is fine. Definitely not luxurious, but clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet is expansive, but coffee is from a self serve machine and not very good. THE LOCATION IS HORRIBLE!  Our taxi driver from the airport told us to only take cabs and not walk around the hotel as it is in a bad area. Buildings around us are crumbling - not the ancient ones - apartment buildings! There’s a chop shop around the corner and “pharmaceuticals” being sold on the next block. We usually like to “wander” and explore when we get to a new city. Not doing that here.

She was brilliant too with our 2 young children and our stay got off to a great start! We went to the rooftop to enjoy the wonderful views of the Acropolsis and some welcome cold beers and juice!   We had an extremely comfortable stay, rooms are dark and quiet and the beds are so comfortable. Had a lovely morning chilling by the rooftop pool and evening with sushi and wine (& juice for the kids!) on the rooftop. You’ve got a fantastic property and a great team!

The main lobby area is also very impressive for business and causal travellers.  I did find the service off colour. Either as a result of lack of training or management has not done enough to develop a service culture. Drinks at the rooftop bar were inordinately delayed and the server’s response was “I have placed order with bar tender so up to him”.  Front desk can also be more proactive and customer oriented. I am not sure if this is a language issue also.   The hotel is in a bit of a rough spot in town. So due care in getting out of lobby etc is essential. Hope that improves in days ahead. Hence rooms on the north side may have some bad views.\n",

      "Review is :I recently stayed at the Wyndham Grand Athens for 2 nights prior to July 4th and then for another night after our visits to Santorini and Mykanos.  I had very pleasant experiences with the front desk personnel who I found to be informative and personable.  Izabel is delightful!!!! The guestrooms are fairly new and comfortable although the AC temperature can vary from room to room. The breakfast buffet is first rate in all areas- eggs, breads, fruit, coffee options.  I feel compelled to respond to other TA feedback:      * Now, yes the lobby area for check in is small and cramped but to me that is a small inconvenience. Ironically the other side of the lobby is under-utilized- perhaps an opportunity for a re-design?  * I read in other reviews that the area is potentially unsafe-…\n",

The problem is the staff, which is totally unfriendly and unhelpful in any given situation, starting with check in, over finding missing personal items from the rooms, over the bell boys which ask you rudely to take your luggage yourself from the storage room as it would take them longer to look for it, and ending with the check-out process. For 14 rooms the check-in process lasted more than 2,5 hours (maybe also because 5 minutes after we arrived, 2 of the 3 receptionists left through the back door and were never seen again). In the end we did not receive all the rooms as booked, but had to take other rooms instead, because it was already after midnight and we were told that no other rooms are available.

Anecdotal as it is, this is the only place I have stayed where you can choose from the normal coffee machine for breakfast (not very good by the way), or pay a few Euros for a cup of Illy cofee.    However, if you are looking for a clean room after spending all day in the beautiful city or you have a couple of days in Athens from your cruise trip, like most of the customers seemed to be, I think it should be okay.

My room wasn’t ready at 9am which is understandable, so I needed some way to pass the time as it was raining outside.  They gave me misinformation about the spa and gym access, so I had to change in the lobby bathroom so I could use the gym. The rooftop pool was nice but small and also became crowded very quickly.

How hard to go out and buy some towels?  The roof top area is large and very nice with great views over to the Acropolis. The waiting staff are friendly and knowledgeable but you might need to go to the bar to get some attention.  The room was clean so no complaints. There was, however, large water stains and peeling paint above the shower. I also begrudge paying for more than 2 coffee capsules. They cost pence to buy.

Excellent accommodations, good food, really exceptional guest services. Consider that this is a chain American hotel without a lot of local flavor. The location is not near the port at Piraeus nor the airport. There is no airport shuttle. The flat rate for one-way taxi fare to the airport is 45 Euros. The hotel offers views of the Acropolis from guest rooms, but it is not in the immediate neighborhood. It is at least a 20 minute walk from the Plaka neighborhood. This is a comfortable hotel located conveniently at a metro stop. It is very reasonably priced and I would stay there again.\n",

I would hate to think the service part was especially bad because we were brown-skinned. We stayed for a week, and were stuck mainly because we had paid upfront back home. The room we were given was very clean no doubt but nothing special, not befitting a five-star rating; the bathroom was very clean, too, no doubt. One woman at the reception deserves special mention. After having dealt with us effusively on Day 1 given we were staying so many days, the minute our travel agent told her we had issues, pretended we didn't exist. Thank you, Ms Fay.

While one might question the location of the hotel in the more doubtful part of downtown Athens, we chose it thanks to its proximity to the subway (right across the street on the square) and the Acropolis which we wanted to be able to walk to.  As is in traveling in any big cities, one merely needs to conduct oneself with common sense and caution.  The hotel is rather new and the rooms well appointed with modern touches.  Room sizes do differ slightly due to the shape of the building and just ask for the more spacious ones.  If you don't care for city views I would recommend the Atrium View rooms as these are incredibly quiet.  Beds and beddings are comfortable and cozy and the blackout curtains help…\n",

Also the 9 floor bar has breathtaking view with the swimming pool there and everything. I put 4/5 stars due to location which i know its not hotel's fault but still. The location is just dirty full of cheap brothels and immigrants flooding inside of them. Too many junkies in the street and too much dirty - smells pee everywhere in the Metaksourgio area.

Not once during or stay were the empty shampoo and shower gel bottles removed from the bathroom.  The food was just OK. What 5-star hotel serves up tinned fruit for breakfast? Cups and empty milk jugs were conveniently located beside the coffee machines but the you had to hunt to find the milk to put in the jugs.   The swimming pool is seasonal and therefore was closed for the winter but there was no indication of this when booking the hotel.  The lifts were a complete joke and were the…\n",

We ordered room service on our last day before leaving and unfortunately it took a long time, they forgot the milk for the drinks of course once the remainder arrived, everything was cold. It generally was a substandard offering anyway. I wouldn't recommend that at all.  We had booked based on the fact they had a pool and spa but they don't specify when the pool is open or not, just that it will be closed when out of season. It was closed when we got there which was quite disappointing.  The spa however was amazing. Although a small, almost afterthought of an area, I think they're expanding to another floor.

It thrives on meetings and events - less intimate for the holiday couple or traveller. The area around the hotel is very rough in places with red light areas - so if u like to walk the city it can be a little challenging at night, Good metro service though if that is your thing and taxis 24/7 available. Resataurants lacked atmosphere for us - but warm and ok menu. breakfast was comprehensive and extensive. Staff seemed a little distAnt and slightly didengaged at times but generally fine.

We had panoramic views from our executive upgrade looking over the city, bay, and Acropolis (thanks again to the reception girls for being so thoughtful). Very disappointing that the swimming pool was off limits even though it was still fully functioning and visible on the rooftop behind the ‘Above’ bar. The senior maitre’d at this bar was quite dour and unwelcoming; his bar staff seemed distracted and inattentive. Overall, it was an enjoyable few days here.\n",

I lost all my confidence on Greek hospitality. When I compared to the hotels where we stayed last 10 days like Metropole, Athenian, and Amalias were so awesome and enoyed every bit in Athens, the location, the people and everything. But this place what is missing is 'HOSPITALITY'. Right from the General Manager below everyone should learn the basics of hospitality. We are so disappointed. Actually Wyndham Grand spoilt our vacation and the essence of…\n",

Rooftop pool has limited hours from 11am to 6:30pm (is unheated, like most pools). Offers and excellent view over the city, especially the parthenon at night.\n",

It is certainly not the cheapest, but I personally enjoyed our 4 nights stay for 450 euros (for a 3 beds room in mid-august). The room is clean and calm, and the toilets are spacious. The service is good, the wifi works perfectly. A rich and delicious buffet breakfast is charged 12 euros/person, this is only worth if you eat quite a lot in the morning, if not, go for a breakfast in the city restaurants. The rooftop pool is tiny and a bit noisy, and the rooftop restaurant with a view on the magnificent Acropolis is good but of course expensive.\n",

Left our luggage at the lobby and took the tour bus into town.Came back a coupla hours later and had to repack my luggage because of xtra stuff I had bought. Realised that I had earlier left my Adidas cap in my room. Asked the reception staff if housekeeping had seen my cap?

Terrific rooftop bar and restaurant- though I went for a short walk and found some terrific little eateries close by - mercifully with not a tourist in sight. Tariff absolutely fair for its genuine 5 star rating. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Suggest you do too if you can tear yourself away from the Plaka.\n",

One hour later, 3 x room price = 486 EUR went out of my account. When I asked the hotel (via booking.com) why this happened, I got the classic \"this is our policy and this was not payment, only money blocked from your account\". Response after one week = \"great\" customer focus. I find this stupid, granting free cancellation and blocking the money, for me is the same, I cannot use this amount until well after check out.

      "Review is :We stayed at the Wyndham Grand for a week between the 9/16 September. We got a taxi from the airport which has a set price of 38 euros and between four of us this worked out very economically as for four people, public transport was a very similar cost. Drive took about 30 minutes. Upon arrival reception was efficient and our room was ready straight away. Room was lovely, large and clean and with a view of the Acropolis. Only issue we had was it was right by the lift. My wife and I are incredibly light sleepers and the slightest noise wakes us. We decided to give it a go but as we suspected, even though no one was too loud, it did keep us awake pretty much all night. I went to reception and asked to change rooms the next morning, and the receptionist (Vicky I think) sorted this…\n",

Then they complimentarily upgrade us from a Superior suite to an Executive suite--which was very nice of them!  The inside of the hotel is better than depicted by the pictures we had seen, and we immediately fell in love with it. Also has a gym and spa, which we didn't use but seemed nice enough.

This hotel is outstanding value when you compare it to what the hotels closer to the Acropolis charge.

It was a really good size, but the floor didn't slope enough towards the drain, and in the absence of having some kind of edge along the floor at the entrance to the shower, you always ended up with water all over the floor.  Other than that, we have no complaints with the property.  The roof top bar offers a stunning view of the Acropolis and was a nice place to have a (overpriced) drink at the end of the night.

Also, although officially there is \"no smoking\" allowed - my room smelled like smoke the entire time I was there.  And there were times when it was so bad that it smelled like someone was actually blowing smoke into my room.   I had read the reviews beforehand and I agree with those who say it isn't the safest area to walk around.  I probably wouldn't stay here again--although, this might be more because I wouldn't visit Athens again and not necessarily just…\n",

Plus we ended up on the 8th floor instead of the 6th floor. The higher up the better the view. Also I recommend a visit to the rooftop for a wonderful view of the Acropolis, either day or night.

The room was great, very spacious with an amazing view of the Acropolis. Loved the free toiletries! More expensive Greek brand than Korres which I hadn't seen before. The downside was a lack of drawer capacity to put clothes in (really lacking here despite a good size wardrobe space) and the rather strange huge showerhead which was so large it felt as if you were drowning whilst showering. Very odd indeed.

I'm very upset about the lack of caring or response. Did the cleaning people take my shirt and never turned it in so no response? I have no idea why they don't respond, but each day that goes by the chances of finding it go down.  Restaurant service was very poor. We had to get our own menus after waiting for over 10 minutes. They weren't busy. When the food came no silverware. We got up and took off another table when none came. We waited for our bill for over 20 minutes. Finally just got up and walked to the door and yelled put it on room xxx. They finally got us our bill.  I had to wait over 20 minutes…\n",

Arriving at around 9.30pm, we wanted to see our Executive Double room with the Acropolis view, and to eat a decent meal.  We were more than upset to be told that we could have a twin bedded room, but not a double - despite booking this room two months in advance.  We were told we might be moved in the morning, and that a bottle of wine, and fruit would be gifted to us as an apology.  We went to our room and found that it wasn't just a twin bed, but a city view of brick walls - no acropolis anywhere in sight!  Additionally, the executive double room with acropolis view was now a STANDARD twin bedded room with city (brick wall) view!  We were hungry, so went to the restaurant…\n",

The included breakfast was massive and the rooms were a nice size and kept very cool. We had a jr suite with a separate living room perfect for a business trip. I asked the doorman if the neighborhood was safe and he said I could walk to the left of the front door but not the right. Do NOT follow your walking GPS around Athens.

The hotel is ok but the location is just awful  you can't just walk out and go to some local coffee bars or eating place there is no atmosphere at all apart from feeling very unsafe very disappointed as we would have liked to soaked up the Greek atmosphere on our last night. The only saving grace is that they have reputable taxis outside the hotel it only cost 5 euros to get into central Athens. Must add the rooftop bar and pool are very nice as well with good views of the Acropolis but no would not stay here again because of the location not the hotel.\n",

Not your typical hotel breakfast.  The rooftop bar and pool area has a great view.  The restaurant was quite pricey compared to the rest of Athens.  The only problem is the location.  We decided to go on vacation 2 weeks before making the reservation so this was actually my third pick for hotels, but the others were full.  I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor and saw the mixed reviews on the location.  We had private tours scheduled each day and they picked us up at the hotel.  We had a driver scheduled to pick us up and take us back to the airport.  At night we used taxis and didn't really hang around…\n",

I have lived in some tough neighborhoods in the Bronx NY during college and this is 10 times worse. I do not recommend walking around this hotel at all. Three blocks over there seems to be 100s of refugees and when I walked past them in the MIDDLE of the street a good majority of them were high or drunk. This was at 4pm on a Wednesday.

The rooftop bar quickly became our favorite hangout. We literally spent hours up there, relaxing on the comfortable couches, noshing on toasties, fries and burgers and enjoying several glasses of beer and wine (and fruity drinks for the kids) while watching the sunlight fade on the Acropolis.

You have to take the metro train to get to syntagma square which is the central location in athens and its two stops away.   The stay was very comfortable. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly.  The breakfast buffet was very very good.  But the highlight is the rooftop bar which has excellent view of the Acropolis and Athens city at night. They also have a DJ and the vibe is really good.The service is not very great in the rooftop bar and they dont have much food options.\n",

Rooms are very spacious and they provide pretty much everything in your room that other hotels these days leave out i.e. iron board and iron, kettle, cups, spoons and even an umbrella. Location is also good with metro nearby and only 3-4 stops to the main Athens tourist areas. There is also a good traditional Greek restaurant just downstairs or a 24hr bakery across the road (bakery is ok though they have lots of variety). No issues with checkin/checkout and the staff helped out and provided free maps and advice if asked.…\n",

The staff were fabulous and could not have been more friendly or welcoming.   The breakfast was very high quality with a good selection of food to choose from.  The one slight downside as other reviewers have pointed out is that the neighbourhood is not the best. This is really no issue though as an uber to downtown takes about 5 minutes and costs about €4.

Walking around is not a pleasant experience, it's recommended to use taxi or metro. - If you want to have quiet rooms avoid staying with street view, the noise is terrible. - if you are sure about your stay here use the prepayment, otherwise the reception will make one deposit 3 weeks before the stay and another one at check in. - the A/C is very, very noisy.  In my opinion is more 4 stars than 5.  I rated average and not poor only because of amiability of the staff.\n",

The location makes it easy to get to major tourist sights such as the Acropolis, Monastiraki Square, and practically anywhere else.  The breakfast buffet left a lot to be desired for me, but there were people who seemed to enjoy it.  The door guys were helpful in giving directions and answering questions.  A couple of times, the housekeeping staff entered the room even though the deadbolt was on.  Very odd!  It seems if the lights were on in the room because of the way the key system works, they would not get past the door.  They came halfway into the room!!  Otherwise, no issues and a high rating.\n",

We stayed in standard city view room which was a bit cramped with the extra bed for our daughter and 2 large suitcases but very clean. Large luxurious shower room. Overall great value as prices we paid were less than youd expect for such quality.

We actually went to another hotel lobby to ask advice when we were unable to get any from here. Our room was nice and comfortable however it was never cleaned. When we brought this up we were told repeatedly that this would be rectified and they apologized. It never was. The bathroom was not cleaned for three days.

However i must stress this area is a little run down, once you step out the hotel you get the sense your in the wrong end of town, once i spoke with friends​ how live her they told me the area is know for drug users and they advised me not to leave to hotel after dark.  In contrast the hotel is beautiful, very modern and recently redeveloped. I stayed in a deluxe room that had a city view, a large flat screen TV and a very nice walk in shower.  A couple more things that let the hotel down was the WiFi, it blocked you going on some sites and the mini bar was outrageous even for mini bar standards.\n",

The bed is so comfortable and I even managed to find an English Channel to watch a movie.  Breakfast has everything you would expect from a 5* with fresh fruit, cakes, eggs,bacon and well just everything really.  The staff are very attentative.  The best though is the beautiful sky bar with views across to the Acropolis which is lit up at night creating an ambience to die for and top that with chill out music.  The pool is also on this floor so whilst relaxing on the comfortable seats you can take in the views of Athens.  Being right next to the metro it's a great location for getting around and about.

Turn left and you'll see the better side of Athens.  I'm not sure I'd class it as a 5 star hotel though. It has a lot going for it but again there was a number of things that needed picking up on but these didn't necessarily affect our stay.   We were given room 803 which was a lovely room with beautiful views of the city and the acropolis.  However the bedside lights played up and we were unable to switch them on or off.

Unfortunately not suitable for the shower, because the entire bathroom is flooded. The additional hand shower must then be used for manual showering (rather 2 star hotel).

      "Review is :I just spent a weekend at this property.  Everything you could need - helpful and service minded front desk, large room - spotlessly clean.  AMAZING shower!  I had a great view of the intersection in front of the hotel.  Not super luxury - but if you are looking for a fine deluxe hotel - this is it. Regarding location - it's a 20 minute walk  (or 5 minute metro ride) to Syntagma Square and a 10 minute walk to Gazi (for those interested in nightlife).  None of the categories below really are suitable.  It's a large hotel, not luxury but certainly deluxe, romantic depends on who you are with - the hotel itself it not romantic. It's not trendy - its very traditional in style (large lobby, front desk, dining room).  It's very user friendly and i recommend\n",

It suppose to be a 5 star but it's way far to see the fifth star shining... Rooms are nice and cozy, nice furnitures  ( hotel is brand new). The temperature in the wasn't adjustable and we don't know why, temperature was Sauna like!!! I had the TV not catching my country TV signal as it was disappearing after few minutes. The \"engineer\" get to the room to push all the remote button, then he said: It's not working!!!!!! REALLY?!?!?!?  The real problem of this hotel are the services, I can only save the front desk personnel, literally wonderful and the Bell boys.

The room view to the Acropolis is priceless. The panoramic view from the roof restaurant and pool are amazing. The hotel also has a spa service in it (did not use it). It's located one metro stop from the Plaka, and it's very easy I get from it to all the touristic locations. Although not the cleanest neighborhood it has some of the best local restaurants, tavernas and bars in a walking distance. And even a two Michelin stars restaurant to those who can afford it. Have fun.\n",

Last but not least the Above roof top restaurant experience! So many different tasty choices with fresh ingredients and stunning 360 view.  Try the succulent grouper or the Greek style shrimp pasta. The desserts were like little paintings!! Try Galaktompoureko with limoncello syrup. Thanks a lot for this unforgettable experience, I will be back very soon!!!\n",

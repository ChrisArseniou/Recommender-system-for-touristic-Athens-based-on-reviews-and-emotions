Renovated so as to accommodate modern travelers, they have managed to retain that air of the grand old hotel with the dark wood, marble floors, and spacious lobbies. The rooftop restaurant provide stunning views and we had access to all of the areas in Athens that we wanted to experience - the Acropolis, Plaka, central city dining and shops. The staff was professional and warm. The rooms are on the dark side, but we figured out the lights and were able to accommodate the need for charging our phones and finding what we needed. We would go back in a heartbeat.\n",

      "Review is :We had no issues with accommodations for our first 3 weeks of travel in Turkey and Greece, until we got to the “5 Star?” Royal Olympic Hotel in Athens. I’ve detailed our issues below:  SAFETY - ELEVATOR: Four people leave the elevator, my wife steps in as the doors close very quickly crushing her. The doors don't reverse direction like safe elevators do; so she is thrust back against me, and then me back against the people who have just left. They break our fall. The elevator doors close and it goes to another floor. We used the stairs for the rest of our visit.  - BATHROOM SHOWER has a slippery concave bottom. Soap will cause you to slip and there's nothing to grab onto to prevent a fall.  MAINTENANCE CALLS - I showed the maintenance guy that I had the THERMOSTAT set at 15 degrees    (Celsius) but the room seemed hotter. He told me \"you want 20, set 10\" (I suspect that most guests don't get this “inside information” and thus the hotel saves on energy costs).  - Our swing-out WINDOW wouldn't close. The maintenance guy pulled the handle up and to the right to get the left side to close. He said \"there, good now.\" I motioned, but he wouldn't look at the right side where the mechanism was bent - leaving a gap to let in hot air, traffic noise and the occasional mosquito.  LOGISTICS: CHECK-IN room allotment is rigid and not adaptive (quote: “no rooms are ready until all rooms are ready!”). At 3PM the queue (mostly bus tour and convention guests) lined up down the length of the main corridor. This queue dissipated to just a trickle by 4PM.  BREAKFAST - Was not all that \"included\"; they charge for anything other than regular coffee. - Same hot meal items every morning for the 4 days we were there. - No salt or pepper to be seen anywhere.  ROOM AMENITIES - No complimentary water. - No coffee maker. - No clock. - No \"About Our Hotel\" booklet. - No face cloths. - No notepaper or pen - Provided bath products were watery. - The double ply toilet paper wasn’t embossed stamped, so the two sheets separated when coming off the roll. The paper was so smooth, it was like trying to use gift wrapping paper. - No laundry service (the only place to drip dry our sink-washed clothing was directly above the toilet). - Only two electrical plugs in the entire suite (none in bathroom vanity area). - Fridge was the cheap semiconductor type, performance was even more hampered by them putting it in a poorly-vented cabinet. To get our drinks cold enough required a 3 Euro room service charge each time we needed ice. - Hair dryer was wall-mounted in the toilet area. The air hose would stretch to the vanity area mirror, but only enough to dry one side of your head. - Electrical control panels were mounted low on the side of each nightstand. After a few days, I developed the \"crouch\" with a flashlight to read and activate the buttons. - The two bed pillows were flat, solved by housekeeping bringing two more so we could stack them.  FALSE ADVERTISING  - Our “Panorama” room had 90% of the view blocked by over-grown plants on the sizable planter box outside our window and by trees growing from below.  BAD JUDGEMENT - A radical political group from a neighboring country that wants to attack Greece and take over their government was allowed to have a convention at the hotel. We experienced very heated arguments in the lobby.  POSITIVES: good central location, towels were great, and shower ran hot & strong.  …\n",

      "Review is :Location is excellent, short walk to the Plaka, Acropolis etc. Stunning views from the rooftop bar and restaurant and the balcony of  our Athenian Panorama room. We stayed twice, at either end of our holiday. Our first room (508) was spectacular – huge room, large sitting area, large bathroom with jacuzzi bath and walk in shower, all very nicely furnished plus a large balcony with deck chairs and a table and fabulous views of the Temple of Zeus and Acropolis. Our second room (601) was very nicely furnished in the same style, also had large balcony with the same view but was a fraction of the size with a much smaller bathroom with stand up shower only – we would have been thrilled with this room had we not seen the first room and it was still perfectly acceptable. Buffet breakfast very ordinary, congealing food in steel trays, coffee dismal, extra charge for cappuccinos etc; somewhat compensated for by spectacular views from rooftop. Very nice pool area with lots of loungers, towels, drinks provided from adjacent bar. Staff were fine, did stick to a 3pm check in so long lineups ensued. Overall an excellent choice for Athens and highly recommended.…\n",

      "Review is :Well sadly I can only write what is true. Classed as a 5* Portrayed by pictures as 5* Actual standard is a struggling 3* The reception area is lovely but beyond that it all goes downhill. We stayed in an 'executive double room' on 6th floor no. 619. No tea making facilities, no robes, no water and an empty mini bar  so just a fridge really! Tastefully decorated - no sadly only old, rather shabby with holes in the curtains and the room smelt of smoke. It did have a safe and ironing board. WiFi was good most of the time. The Bathroom was beyond belief, a very old block box style hairdryer a loo and tiny bath with a hose that could not be used as a shower, it was too short and the shower head holder was placed on the wrong wall you could not stand under it, so with a shower - definitely not! We asked them to rectify this after suffering 2 days all they did was put another longer hose on but you still couldn't stand under it as it was on the sloping end of the bath! This is a very basic function we all need in a hotel room isn't it? The balcony was just big enough for 2 chairs. There are no rooms around the pool even though they sell you this image on their website! We used the restaurant on one occasion, (not on the night we wanted as they shut the restaurant off for a private function) the views were magnificent but the lighting was way too low you couldn't see to eat. Rather expensive for some really basic food. The breakfast was good but the same every morning, and don't upset the blonde manageress! The pool is a nice area but the pool bar was never open, you had to get served from the inside bar, when someone was there. You can't get to the pool from reception they keep the big doors locked you have to walk all the way round and generally through people attending some function going on there of which there were a lot.  All in all not really a pleasant stay for the money paid, the hotel is under staffed which make the people that work there tired and unhelpful, the bedrooms need a serious overhaul and the Web site needs to truly represent what your not getting for your 5* payment. I felt we were not treated as a paying customer but more like an inconvenience to be tolerated. I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND if your looking for 'just a touch of luxury' on your stay. …\n",

We had to ask reception for new towels and house keeping to attend as it was missed. The rooms Do not have a kettle or drink faculties.  Breakfast was awful.

      "Review is :Location of Hotel is great for Acropolis Museum etc. We were upgraded to a panorama room on 1st floor (maybe due to contacting concierge in advance with some questions about the facilities), despite overlooking the street it was quiet with full windows across the entire room overlooking the temple. Room had all the usual facilities - except for lack of a kettle and tea-making stuff! Refurbished in a LouisXIV style which is a bit dramatic. We had an evening drink on the rooftop bar with great views as the sun went down. Also a good breakfast there, buffet-style with good local yoghurt, fruits and breads. We used the pool a couple of times; good size and several loungers. Staff were very keen to close it as soon as rain threatened, but when the sun came out again we simply went…\n",

The room was dated back in the 1960s. One still used blankets and a bedspread  in stead of quitl. A hotel should be judged by its cheapest room. It was clearly not worth 5 stars. The breakfast buffet was ok. The pool had quite a few flaws. A heap of tiles were cracked and it was very very slippery. The pool was obviously not cleaned. Location is top. The hotel has a beautiful view.\n",

Our stays are usually just 2-3 days so we feel no great need for superior rooms as we only need a base at which to change, shower and sleep.    On this occasion, we were given room 615.  Must be the smallest in the place but that’s not a problem in itself.    What is a problem is a bathtub/shower that is approx 45cm wide!  I mean, really?  Also, the bath/shower ‘switch’ would not stay in ‘bath’ position when filling the bathtub.  It was impossible to shower so we bathed.    What is also a problem is the door to the balcony has been severely damaged by previous guests to the extent that it won’t close properly.

Younger tourists might prefer a more “hip” location, but it was ideal for us seasoned travelers. The rooms are a bit shabby but very clean and comfortable: the curtain showed a repaired section, the bathtub was very narrow and old-school (although we all fit in it - not all four of us at once, of course!)

The elevator arrangements are mad, multiple tiny lifts you can barely get 2 people in and have seperate hotel sections to get from rooms to bar and restaurant requires two lift trips.

I was anxious before arriving, having read all the less-than-positive reviews but was pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by friendly staff and immediately shown to our rooms after a 10.5-hour flight. The location of this hotel can't be beaten. It is within walking distance of many attractions such as the Acropolis, Plaka, and Parliament. It is also a short taxi ride to the port. Our only \"complaint\" is that the pool closed at 7 pm.

Two suggesstions to improve slightly this 5 star hotel so perhaps to have complimentary tea/coffee  facilities in the room which we have experienced in a 4 and 5 star that we have stayed before in a different cities and the other some  more fruits to choose from for example strawberries.melon bananas to mix on their delicios Greek yoghurt.But…\n",

Breakfast on the roof is ok , self service buffet, but view of Acropolis is worth it all . Location is great , 5-7 minutes walk to the old Plaka district. Outside swimming pool but no spa . Price 200 euros for mid range room . The best is the roof breakfast dining room and the bar, with breathtaking view of the Acropolis, the Zeus temple and the Licavitos mountain .\n",

DO NOT order a taxi through bellman Demitris Vlachos. Other taxi drivers warned us not to order a taxi through him because his drivers charge a higher price and give him a cut of the money.  Finally, this is not a 5 star hotel. Don’t be fooled by the nice pictures online. Those pictures were taken when the hotel was first built, but in reality the rooms are very old and have never been upgraded. The blankets smelled musty like they haven’t been washed in…\n",

The pool was welcoming after a hot day's walking. My only issue is the bed! lumpy old pillows and a very hard and ageing bed - they obviously need updating - I can't see why this basic issue can't be fixed which would make it a true4/5 star hotel.

The rooftop restaurant is a great place to hang out and have a glass of wine after a day of sight seeing, but the cocktail menu is straight out of 1986 and could use a refresh.  We never ate a full dinner there, given all of the fabulous other places to eat, but breakfast was big and decent.

After booking a Deluxe Double  room , went to room and it was over looking the pool room 368, from the the website picture  it showed it was views looking out to the city.  I did go to ask at reception and the nice concierge said i could have a room over looking the main road but is nosey with trafic. The rooms have that nice warm and lush feel and veary large bed, as well veary comfortable to sleep on. The breckfast is served on top floor 7 and as the stunning views of athens land mark's food is fresh and a good selection from any country you come from, staff are extremely polite and friendly.  Did look at the evening menu but for me i feel for a three courses and couple drinks it would be around 150 euros…\n",

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied, though disappointing for vegans.  If you require gluten free you would have to ask.\n",

Think of classic curtains, carpet, headboard of the bed and bed cover were all in matching cobalt blue and gold. Large room. My king bed consisted of 2 single beds placed together. Gilded picture frame surround the flat screen TV. No electric socket near the bed. Small fridge without kettle/ coffee/ tea making facilities. Bathroom was bright in white marble. Toilet produced rather loud flushing sound. My room looked over the outdoor swimming pool in the courtyard.

While it served its purpose, I would stay elsewhere next time I visit Athens if given a choice.   The location is good - a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis and Plaka area. 10 minutes (even after running a marathon) from the Panathenaic Stadium stadium (marathon finish line). Lots of restaurants are within 5-10 minute range. That said, there are a lot of hotels in the area to choose from - so this doesn't make it unique.  The lobby and common areas of the hotel give the impression of a higher class hotel. That is, until it rained a lot, and the roof started leaking everywhere in the common areas.

During this stay we were upgraded to the panoramic room (in which we’ve stayed before) which offers lovely views of Zeus’ temple as well as being more spacious than the executive or deluxe rooms. This is not your average bland modern hotel - it’s got a style - marble bathrooms, decorative furniture, pelmets on the windows etc - that’s what makes it.

We received an upgrade on our first night, but the room which we had during the rest of our stay was fine. Staff were great, rooftop restaurant, where we had breakfast daily and occasionally cocktails in the evening was magnificent. (A perfect view of the Acropolis). Easy walk to shops and restaurants. At 6:30 am each day I would travel to the rooftop and sip coffee in the dark, and view the Acropolis, which was still lit. This before breakfast. Many conversations with the very friendly staff.

We had a view of the pool.  We sat by the pool one day, water was too cold to get in.  We ordered lunch and didn't care for it, so except for breakfast, we did not eat there.  Easy to walk to the ruins and museum.  We walked to a nearby Tiki bar that was good.  The walk to the nice sidewalk cafes area is a farther walk, maybe 30 minutes.

No explaining of how the hotel worked including the most basic such as where breakfast was served and hours etc. Acted like she was being bothered and did not want to be there.

The breakfast is good and varied, however, there may be not enough tables for all guests and you may have to wait a bit on a line.

We booked an Executive room for four nights. At first the room and bathroom seemed spacious enough, but bottom line, it just wasn't functional at all. Only two electrical outlets in the room, so we had to be selective on charging phones, laptops and camera batteries. The safe was mounted so near the floor that you have to get on your hands and knees to access it. Also the springs on the safe door…\n",

Ideal if you like:- very clean rooms; don't mind dated decor (but everything was immaculate, clean carpets, no mould); a powerful shower; hardly any road noise from 2nd floor; very good air conditioning; 10-15 minute walk from the Acropolis & main sights; great view from the 7th floor bar. Avoid if you prefer:- beige modern decor; need a more personal approach from staff; this is a conference hotel so it is impersonal; coffee/tea making in the room; evening turn down; lifts are always busy!  For us it was ideal for a city break where we had somewhere clean & close to rest our weary heads.

We stayed there for only 2 nights, in an executive double room and it was lovely. Huge bed, spotless and maid service excellent. The staff at the reception desk was friendly and well organised. The staff at the roof top restaurant was also great, couldn't do enough for us.  Note that the mini bar is extremely expensive, I understand they have to charge more then usual but a tiny bottle of Smirnoff vodka was €9, and Jack Daniels was €11.50! The breakfast was good, with all varieties of cold and hot food. Views are amazing. Overall we would stay here again in the future.\n",

The property is well appointed and beautifully kept, our room overlooking the pool was immaculate.  The rooftop bar has views to die for.   For me there are two downsides to the hotel.  Firstly it now seems to be primarily used for conferences, so you have large groups of people in the restaurant, pool and public areas that we found quite intrusive at times and secondly, some of the waiting staff and reception staff were just unbelievably rude.

The hotel definitely knows how to put on the charm in both creature comforts and personal attention to the guests needs. We used their roof garden terrace for breakfast where views of the Acropolis were spectacular, the food was very delicious and had a wide selection. Location of the hotel allows you to walk to the nearby strip of restaurants and enjoy many different tastes of Greece. Thanks Team.\n",

This hotel is superbly located and you can walk to most of the important places of interest from here.  The good things about this hotel are; the breakfast (including the view), the location, the lovely cleaning staff and the pool with very comfy sun loungers.  The things that could be improved are; the tea (tepid at most), staff seemed disinterested, the pool closed early two nights for other functions.  But we had a fabulous time and found the hotel comfortable and suited our needs.\n",

It is very centrally located being just a few minutes walk to the Acropolis entrance, restaurants, parks and the Metro. The public areas are classical in style. The restaurant on the top floor is also where you have breakfast has an AWESOME view of the Acropolis and surrounding area. The breakfast was fairly standard for this type of hotel but nothing out of the ordinary. Our room 568 was a reasonable size, clean and tidy but very dim and basic. The bathroom whilst adequate could definitely do with a revamping as it is very old.  For the price we paid it was really quite good\n",

However, our room was horrendous. Tiny, dirty, and the balcony was riddled with ants. We also, despite being a couple on their honeymoon, had 2 beds pushed together that moved every time we rolled over.   Fortunately for us, we were only there for 2 nights.

The view is wow from the rooftop where breakfast is massive assortment to please everyone. The pool is lovely but the waiters are awful. If they had a cocktail of the day at a reasonable price & decent service, they wouldn’t have guests bringing their own!! Even getting a towel is awkward instead of having them out readily available. These staff let everyone down as everyone else are so helpful & warm. The porters & reception are lovely & super efficient. Great Athens stay to our trip, booked on hotel website & fantastic correspondence & best rate.\n",

Great views of the beautiful ruins of Athens, with a short walk to the Acropolis , Sytangma Square and other cafe/tourist shops & restaurants.  Customer checkin & checkout is a little slow( If you are to arrive early like us or way before your checkin which is 3:00pm , then you will  either be asked to wait in there sitting areas or go out for a while as you will \"NOT BE ABLE TO CHECK IN BEFORE 3:00PM AT ALL\"). This place has beautiful spacious rooms, a great outdoor pool and pool sitting area etc....(only bad thing about the pool is you need to get there early so you can grap yourself a sunbed or sitting spot).

The view from the roof restaurant is second to none in Athens, and makes this Hotel 5*. We had an Executive room overlooking the pool (room 412), with a small balcony - which was an unexpected bonus. The balcony was sunny all day. The staff were al friendly. We spent our mornings sightseeing before retiring to the pool area around 3pm. Really worked well for us. The only things that we felt would improve the Hotel were tea / coffee making facilities in the bedrooms, and piping hot water at breakfast for the tea. Other than that, we were very happy with the Royal Olympic.\n",

Front desk was able to prepare our room for an early check-in (Many thanks to the gracious Despina). We waited just a bit for the room at the lovely rooftop bar overlooking the Temple of Zeus. Breakfast in the adjacent restaurant was plentiful and delicious. We had dinner in the same restaurant which transforms itself into a fine-dining setting: candlelit under the illuminated…\n",

We had a problem with the tub draining and difficulty with turning lights on and off which were quickly fixed by the hotel staff.  I've stayed at the Beverly Wilshire and the Georges V in Paris.

The bar is open and it was wonderful having a drink at the end of a long day of touring while watching the sunset over the Parthenon. Just superb!

Secondly the bath and shower was crazy, it was an enormous spa bath with a hand held shower.

Sometimes the lobby was filled with coach tour groups which made it loud and annoying,otherwise it was fine. Keytours are located literally next door which was useful.Didnt bother getting an Acropolis view room as found the charges for this a bit too high to make it worth while although plenty of people did.

The dinner at the top of the hotel (similar view) was a short flight of steps from the room (we were in 601), also very good. If you want to stay near the main attractions of Athens and enjoy a luxurious room with a spectacular view, no better place to stay. Of course, you need to ensure to book a room with the terrace/balcony for the views. Not sure if other rooms have the same. Caveat: beds are on the hard side and only one small pillow (however, there are some more in the closet). Only reason not 5 star for me. P.S. the picture is from the rooftop restaurant which I sent to my mom on mother's day. :-)\n",

I called the hotel to advise them of our delayed arrival and even though we were within the 24 hour cancelation fee range, they waived the missed night. That meant a lot since we had to pay for an unexpected hotel in our delayed layover location. The front desk was always so nice and even remembered us by name. The hotel and views were AMAZING and exactly what we hoped for based upon the pictures. I would highly recommend the Athenian Panorama Room - worth the beautiful view and balcony. Excellent location, as well. Everything is within walking distance!\n",

Important note: if you are used to stay in 5star hotels around the world, you will find a similar quality level to e.g. Brazil. But far away from asia.

      "Review is :We had three nights in the Royal Olympic, paying to upgrade to one of their Athenian Panorama rooms. The room was extremely spacious with a very comfortable queen sized bed. The bathroom was lovely, all in marble with a large jacuzzi bath for a couple. The room had a great view over the Temple of Zeus and indirect view of the Acropolis. For a spectacular view of the Acropolis, go up to the 7th floor bar. Staff were attentive and very helpful.  On the slightly negative side, the air conditioning is seasonal and so our room was stifling on the first night - even in April when it was around 20 degrees outside. It was also musty because of a lack of regular airing. However, the staff unlocked the windows for us which cooled it down although never fully got rid of the smell. For the…\n",

The transportation from the airport to the hotel can be easily arranged and paid at the end of your stay. 2. LOCATION- the location of this place is amazing because you can literally walk to la plaka in such a short amount of time. Next to the hotel, there is a small convenience store where you can grab any small items you mightve forgotten back home. It feels very safe to walk around at night from the hotel to la plaka. 3.

Pros: Yummy breakfast, close to the city centre, comfortable beds, helpful staff, great view from the rooftop restaurant  Cons: We opted for the cheaper room with no window and so the room was hot as the air conditioning was not that effective!\n",

When we arrived the man behind the desk was quite dismissive and not very friendly we got our room key and as soon as we opened the door to the room was instantly dissapointed with how small it was, also the fact there was no tea and coffee facilities only room service. The electric curtains didn't work and neither did half the light controls at the side of the bed. We went down to complain and got moved to a larger room but still faulty electrics and no electric curtains, when turning on bathroom light through night turned on all lights in room. I cannot fault the restaurant and room service staff they are a credit to this hotel…\n",

But the hotel rooms, the staff, the service is very poor. The rooms are quite crumpy, you dont even have a electric kettle in the room which is available in the OYO rooms also. And as i was travelling with a kid of 15 months getting the warm water was a hectic process. And if you order tea in the room - tea is for 2.5 euros and the service charge is 3 euros which is quite a costly affair for a cup of tea. and they have deliberately not kept the kettle to earn the money from this. They don't give packed breakfast if you have a early morning flights.\n",

The location is prime with a majestic view of the Acropolis and other Athens sites.   The rooms leave a lot to be desired.  We stayed in both wings.  Do not stay in the older wing - it was like going back to a hotel in the 70s with the decor and musty smell.  We also had a bad case of bedbugs in room 103 (supposedly a luxurious suite).

The pool gets just a couple of hours of sunlight per day, There are only a couple of tiny elevators and Good Luck trying to move your luggage or get to the breakfast room!!!  The gym is a half block walk from the hotel, you must walk through the main entrance lobby (in your bathers) to access the pool. We paid a lot of money for a large room with a balcony. Trouble is... we couldn’t use the balcony at all due to location and incredibly loud traffic noise just outside. I would urge anybody that is thinking of staying in Athens to keep well away from the Royal Olympic and look…\n",

      "Review is :Large hotel with central location. The roof-top restaurant offers panoramic views towards the Acropolis and the surrounding city. Paradoxically the hotel seems under-dimensioned for the actual volume of guests: The elevators are small, so expect long waits and crowded rides. The breastfast restaurant is overly busy, I waited 20 minutes to be seated. Well-equipped room. However the bathroom was rather small. My room faced a busy and heavily trafficed street, but this did not disturb my sleep. Wifi works well.\n",

It is literally a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis, the Athens Museum as well as The Plaka and the Temple of Deus.  HOWEVER, the not so good part is the hotel. The hotel is by no far a five star hotel as advertised. The rooms lack basic tea/coffee making facilities.

Second, it has a really nice rooftop restaurant (where the food is just about OK, but the view is great, and that's where you have breakfast), and a garden rooftop bar with a fabulous view of the Acropolis and Parthenon. But these are not necessarily available to the guests. We stayed for two nights in August 2018 and on each night the bar was closed for private events - once all evening, and the second day for about two and a half hours.

      "Review is :The 7th floor roof terrace (restaurant and bar) has without a doubt one of the best views in the world with Lycabettus Hill, the Observatory, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, and the Acropolis greeting you each dawn as the sun rises over the city and in the evening it is the backdrop that the phrase \"romantic dinners\" was coined for. For those of us who do not do romantic dinners it is the best view that I have ever had while eating a steak. It is a breathtaking vista and on its own would make this hotel worth recommending to any traveller to Athens. It is simply stunning and almost without parallell in any city centre hotel, in my experience.   The lobby and ground floor area of this hotel is five star rated. The rest of the building - not so much. The hotel is a combination of…\n",

It’s within walking distance to the Temple of Zeus & the Parthenon @ the Acropolis & the Acropolis Museum. There’s a strip of restaurants & souvenir shops within a 5-10min walk as well. If you don’t want to walk, 5 euros will get you a good distance via taxi. The icing on the cake is the roof top restaurant with perfect views of the Acropolis & Temple of Zeus; beautiful during the sunset. The rooms are quite roomy for European standards just remember to bring your own face cloth LoL... The breakfast buffet was decent with a large spread of food: fruits, veggies, cereal, oatmeal, lunch meat, cheese, eggs,…\n",

      "Review is :At time of booking this hotel, we based it on both the pictures on TripAdvisor and by members comments regarding the general hotel and it’s location! I personally feel duped into this, as the hotel foyer aesthetics is horribly misleading to the value of the cheaper ‘no star’ rooms! Effectively you’re paying €170 per night for a €50 room! (With equally shocking bathrooms, outdated furnishings...😢). Then to charge more for more modest ‘normal 3 star rooms’...  kudos to Daniel at front reception to salvage our first day nightmare!  The dinners were outlandishly expensive £35 for some stuffed chicken balls!  If you think that you’re getting a trade of to being close to the wonderful bazaars, etc... it’s a €5 cab from the Crowne Plaza!!!\n",

Hotel itself is beautiful with amazing decor around to keep you gazing throughout your stay. The staff were polite, courteous, helpful in many ways. The room was a standard room that even though I thought a deluxe room would’ve had better accommodations, but for the most part it did the job. The bed was super comfortable and plenty of drawers for extreme clothes packers such as us. Only thing that I would complain about is the air conditioning. Ours was barely blowing any cold air and if we forgot to leave it on for a day then the room would take forever to get cold again, especially in that hot Athenian weather. Overall, great hotel and…\n",

Our king sized bed was two twin beds, individually made and pushed together.  The bed comforter looked old/used and I wasn't comfortable with it staying on the bed. Two very mushy and used pillows on the bed.  The bathroom was pretty but the glass only covered 1/2 of the shower so the entire bathroom would flood when we showered and we'd have to use all of our towels to keep the flood from getting into the room.  No outlets by the bed or in the bathroom.  We found one underneath the desk and one on the wall outside of the bathroom. Very close to the Acropolis and panathenaic stadium.

We stayed there one night before a cruise and it was all fine. When we stayed there 3 nights post cruise - we booked deluxe rooms and they were a mess. The first room we were put in had really bad mold in the ceiling in the bathroom, so they grudgingly moved us. The second room also had mold and the furniture was old and tired. See the attached pics. It’s a pity because it’s in a nice location but never again for me.\n",

The restaurant manager upstairs takes his job very seriously but unfortunately there is  a certain air of arrogance that lacks friendliness and flexibility.  When we arrived our luggage was delivered with such neglect and just hastily dropped in our room with no attention to any welcoming sentiment.  No effort was made to even ask us if we would like our luggage placed anywhere in the room!  (maybe it was too hot that week and everyone felt spent?).

The cost to upgrade is 70€ at the time of my stay, so it's a matter of choice: waking up to the view of the temple of Olympus or just stepping out and seeing that and the Acropolis everyday. The good: location isn't on the main tourist path yet close to everything. breakfasts are decent with efficient staff. housekeeping ladies in the corridors are friendly and always willing to assist. The bad: Curt front desk. I was there for 5 days and there wasn't a check out I witnessed that…\n",

No need to stay for dinner, menu is quite restricted and Athens has some great restaurants.   Varoulko is worth a visit with a Michelin star, probably the lowest bill i have has in such a high class environment.   Arcadia close to the hotel looks very touristy but was surprisingly good.  Tzatzikas and mermigas is also worth a visit.  Note food is served mainly as portions for 2.  Clarify this at the outset to avoid food waste and incurring unnecessary cost.

We stayed in two Athenian Panoramic View rooms & the views of the Temple of Zeus were stunning...both during the daytime & at night! It’s as if you are standing on the steps of the temple. It definitely got us in the Athens frame of mind! We had drinks in the pool bar and the…\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is centrally located so you can visit the main attractions within a 5-10 min walk. Its an incredibly busy hotel and the staff didn't seem to have the time to be overly courteous but they were pleasant enough. The 'executive suite' wasn't overly executive but then we hadn't  planned on being in the room much.   Having breakfast on the roof top looking at the Parthenon was stunning. The breakfast buffet was incredible in itself. The view at night, with the sun setting is spectacular but the price tag that accompanies dinner is very high so be warned. The pool is nice, doesn't open till 9:30 and the sun doesn't really hit the area till after 10am  during summer. If you plan on spending time there for a swim, do it before noon or dont be late after your site seeing. The…\n",

      "Review is :A centrally located old hotel in Athens with multiple annex with no linkage.  One has to use two elevators to reach the rooftop restaurant for breakfast or others.  Greatest disappointment is that the water system in the bathroom produces hot and cold water intermittently.  That makes showering quite uncomfortable.  The AC system needs revamping.  Apart from that, the rooms are average in decor.  The morning free buffet breakfast is good, the night light of the Parthenon is magnificent.  This hotel is centrally located, and is a short walk to placa, shopping, and other famous historical sites.  That is why tour groups pick this hotel as their camp ground.\n",

When we were last in Athens with kids we stayed in Elektra Palace, which I probably would have preferred (it was booked out for our trip this time)....I have taken a star off because the service was good and everyone spoke English, which was super helpful, but they weren't very friendly...they were professional, but not overly friendly.

This hotel is just a few minutes from everything you'd want to walk to-Acropolis, Acropolis museum, Ancient Agora, Hadrians Library, Monstriaki, Anafiotika. It took us about 5 minutes to get to Plaka and from there everything is in your path.  If you stay in an Athenian panoramic room (which we highly recommend) you have the most stunning view of the temple of Zeus from your floor to ceiling windows and balconies, with views of Lycabettus Hill and the Acropolis. Breakfast was included,  which was delicious with a lovely view. We would absolutely stay here again!\n",

The big minus comes because the hotel bar denied to sell any fresh fruits even though they had them. They required that I need to buy fruit salad from the menu if I wanted fruit. I did not care how much a fresh fruit would cost. I think I don't need to explain why I needed my fruit.

Getting there from the airport was easy in a taxi, no drama, took about 40 minutes. The hotel lobby is large, marble clad, tastefully decorated and wonderfully cool given the 33 degrees outside.

We keep kosher and asked if the hotel could warm up our double wrapped food (since we cannot eat elsewhere) and they refused to do that for us so we had to eat cold food. The staff was not helpful or friendly to us at all. I will say that the location is convenient for a lot of the major tourist attractions (three-minute walk from Hadrian's arch) and the rooftop bar has a nice view.\n",

We chose this hotel for two reasons: it has a pool and it is close to the Acropolis.    Positives: The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis.  lt has very nice common areas, with many places to sit and relax.  The hotel pool is lovely but it is very deep with no \"shallow end\" (for those with small children). We never had a problem getting chairs or loungers by the pool and the pool staff were very nice.  We swam every day, usually twice!  All of the hotel staff were friendly and efficient. Also, the breakfast was good.    Negatives: the room itself was tiny and shabby.  We booked a room for 2 adults and 1 child. The room had two single beds and they put a cot in, which…\n",

      "Review is :First off, a lot of Athens hotels are in serious need of updating, this one included. It's like being in the 80's, but I will say the restaurant on the rooftop certainly adds to this. While the outdated furnishings and desperate need for bathroom updating, there are far worse places to stay in Athens, and I have stayed in those (this is my 3rd time in Athens, first time at Royal) this is by far one of the better ones in th Plaka.  Pros - centrally located, great concierge service to hail a taxi and carry bags, rooftop restaurant with great views and food, buffet breakfast was solid.  Cons - outdated, executive twin rooms are quite small, but how long are you really in it? Elevators are like jumping into a time machine, barely fit 2 people.

The suite itself; Precious Breakfast and the friendliness of the waitress who took our dinner order; very sweet person.  Aspects to improve... That there was no one to help with the suitcases to take them to the room or then collaborate taking them to the taxi or rental car to check out. They lacked a bell boy. Reception staff very unfriendly and empathetic, both check in and check out. It could be improved a lot in that aspect. I think it's the weakest point ... a pity.\n",

Yes, it was expensive, however it is Athens and as with any large city, quality rooms at a nice hotel will be pricey.

The location was also very good and close to restaurants and shopping. About 5 min walk and maybe 10 mins to the Acropolis. Can't beat that! Consider the Hop on Hop off buses. They are inexpensive and a great way to get around and see all that the city has to offer. Also enjoy the beautiful views for breakfast at the roof top garden. I would highly recommend staying here and chose the same room...you will love it!\n",

No enough light in the room Gym outside of the hotel  Terrible view: instead of swimming pool, i was looking in front of a building.   Nice view from restaurant.\n",

Roof top dining area on 7th floor offered a superb view of the Parthenon and Temple of Zeus, especially at night.   Disappointment: 1. This hotel does not provide kettle in the room and they charged me 3 Euro dollars for a small pot of hot water delivered to the room; 2. The wall plug does not pre-installed with universal AC power adaptor which I am used to in many hotels in Asia.

The hotel is located directly across from the Temple of Zeus and an easy walk to the Plaka.  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant with a view of the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus.  We made a dinner reservation prior to arrival at the hotel which was essential to getting a table on the terrace with a perfect view.  Dinner is expensive, but the food is quite good with excellent service.  We thoroughly enjoyed our evening there.  Rooms are a bit out of date, but are fine.  Service at the hotel is good.  Nice bar next to the pool with a good bartender.  Lots of groups clearly stay at this hotel, but it was not crowded and noisy.\n",

It just has a beautiful lobby and breakfast area but trust me, lack of warmth kills that also.

I was booked into a deluxe room but upgraded to a suite on arrival - it was nice although being on the first floor with an internal view of the pool I found the room quite dark, even with all the lamps on it never seemed to get quite bright enough. The staff are friendly and as other reviews have mentioned, having breakfast on the outside terrace of the 7th floor is a genuinely lovely experience. The lifts are a bit of a struggle at busy periods - small and don't all go to the same places - I was lucky to be able to use the stairs but they could do with an upgrade.

The hotel overlooks the Temple of Zeus and has great views of that monument and the Acropolis from its restaurant. It was just a 5 minute walk to the temple, the Acropolis, the National Gardens and the Plaka area.  The food, ambience and service in the restaurant were excellent and the views were breathtaking. It was however very pricey. The bar was nice but we found the bar staff fairly inattentive. Breakfast was included and was to a good standard with a wide variety of cooked and continental options available.  The reception staff were pleasant and the porters were very helpful.

Cabs were also readily available. For never having visited the city before, I loved the convience the hotel had to offer.  On top of the location, the hotel has a stunning roof top bar with amazing views of the Parthenon and the Temple of Zeus.

The electric curtains not working, amenities are little, AC almost not working & lighting & it’s controls is too sophisticated & outdated. Nevertheless the hotel location might be the best if you are traveling to visit the monuments. You can see the Acropolis from the breakfast restaurant on top too. Breakfast can be better at least a coffee machine providing espresso or the famous Greek coffee. Service is good staff very pleasant.

I heard there are also rooms with modern showers, no bath. Please renovate all rooms soon. The breakfast is not really inspiring, but the view is great. Drinks in the bar are very expensive.

Unfortunately there was no tea or coffee facilities in the room we had! We never ate in the restaurant apart from breakfast each morning. This I would only note 1 out of 5 and that’s not for the quality of food served but simply because of the chaotic service every morning. Firstly on arriving in the breakfast dining area there was never a table available. You could enter the area from one of two ends. The first morning we simply sat ourselves down at a table because unlike most restaurants you are received by the breakfast…\n",

The room is clean and the staff is really helpful and kind. I didn't bring my adapter for my mobile and they just let me used theirs for free!

The pool area was also nice and clean, and had sun for much of the day.  However, the images of the rooms across all booking sites are inaccurate - they are old and feel quite outdated. There is also no iron available in the room, which meant we also had to pay €7 to have a single item of clothing pressed.

They advertise many pictures and I was told I had a room with views of the Acropolis.  Apparently a \"Executive Room\" qualifies for the top floor (6th) but a room with a very a large block wall directly outside the patio.

I had an interior room at first, but the air was so bad in the room as the air conditioning/ventilation didn't work properly. We opened the window to get airflow, but the air coming from the window was exhaust from the air conditioning system for the hotel. Yuck! We both got sick, I lost my voice and have had congestion ever since. It was like breathing in dirty soup! They finally switched us to another room - for what is available in Athens for the money we paid, we should have been in the exterior room in the first place.

Thirty years ago, we used to travel with a little coffee making kit, nowadays we expect to be able to make a cup of tea or coffee in our room.  Not only was there no kettle in the room, they wouldn't even let me take a cup of tea from the lounge to my room, saying I have to order it through room service, which would have more than doubled the price of the cup of tea!  at the desk, we were told that this is the owner's policy.

My colleague had his bag stolen in the conference room while he was a few feet away. Either the security is so lax that any thief can walk in off the street and wander the hotel, or the staff are calling their buddies to rob poor tourists/conference-goers. It's incomprehensible that in 2017 a major hotel has no cameras at the door or in the elevator, so if you value your security, I would NOT stay in or even visit this hotel.

Unfortunately, we have VERY mixed feelings about this place mainly due to the front desk staff approach.   During our check-in, the front desk representative told us that only one person has included breakfast in the room rate; therefore, we were charged additional 28 Euros for another breakfast. Hmm… that was weird. He told us to take it up with Booking.com, but that’s what it is. The Executive room he checked us into was on the first floor and was facing a wall.

Breakfast was crowded on that day so we were sharing tables but I'm a biker too so the Harley fanciers and I shared a common interest. Rooms were perfectly good but not much better than a UK Premier Inn. The entrance kind of over sells the rooms but the location is excellent. The roof top breakfast on a clear day overlooking Hadrian's Arch under a crisp cobalt Hellenic sky is breathtaking. An easy walk to the Acropolis, the Plaka shopping  and restaurant area, the Greek Parliament to watch the remarkable guards and the calm National Gardens. So overall, I am happy with our choice.

Food was very nice, very fine dining but very tasty and so worth it.  Beds are comfortable, staff are friendly and helped my husband arrange me flowers and wine for our anniversary.\n",

You have a view of the Acropolis, The Temple of Zeus and the Lycabettus Hill. What more can you ask? You can forget sugar and cream to whatever you are drinking. The only thing to mention here is they should put a sign that says the line starts at the host stand to get you a table (in English). There are three (3) guest access that I know to get to the rooftop.

      "Review is :this hotel was the first stop on our Greek honeymoon tour. i thought it was a great experience, especially for the price. they knew it was our honeymoon so they upgraded us from a room with a pool view to one with the temple of zeus - it was so pretty to sit on our balcony both during the day and at night being able to see the temple and the acropolis.   the room was small, but clean and cosy - had an outdated appearance but that didn't bother us. the hotel was a 5-10min walk to the city center so it was really convenient to go back and forth from the activities and restaurants we had planned. i wouldn't recommend getting a massage as the spa is just a hotel room that guests don't stay in and it was too hard for what I like, but everything else was great. the staff was really…\n",

I was there for part of my honeymoon and stayed in one of the rooms with a patio overlooking Zeus' temple. 😍 Breath taking view of the temple and the Acropolis. A walking distance of all the main attractions and delicious food. Totally recommend this place if you're willing to spend a bit more, worth it!\n",

The entrance is very beautiful and, even when the rooms are not a luxus (we didn't have a window), the hotel has something magical: the top floor is the dinning room and you can have breakfast or dinner enjoying the incredible views of the Acropolis. I enjoyed myself taking a lot of pictures from there and I have to recommend it to all the tourists that visit Athens. Moreover, in only 5 minutes by foot you arrive to Plaka. It's a very good option in Athens. The area seems very safe and nice.\n",

The room is also right over an intersection so we had the pleasure of listening to honking at all hours of the day and night. It was the least relaxing hotel stay I've ever had. I could tell we were walking to the crap section of the hotel because the carpet on the hall floor changed from this beautiful blue plush to ratty, torn-up underlayment (not even a carpet) and boom, there was our room! The room was poorly maintained; one of the lights over the desk area didn't work, the remote control didn't work, etc. Staff at the front desk were rude and not enjoyable to engage with.

Being vegetarians, we appreciated having a very good Indian restaurant right next door.  Our executive room was very nice. Plenty of room and tastefully furnished. You must be wondering why I did not give it a 5 star.   There is no coffee machine in the room. No complimentary water. I had forgotten my comb and they could not help me. The people at the reception could have been more helpful and courteous.   They have a beautiful terrace restaurant with views of the Parthenon & Mount Seuss. Food could have been better. I did not appreciate not having an omelette station, but when I requested, they were nice enough to make them at no extra cost.\n",

The prices of in-house food, beverages and laundry etc, however, are not minuscule - the stock-standard 5 star rip-off! Our room had a minuscule balcony with view of a wall and, if you turned your head sharply, the pool - which closes at 1900. Be aware that the pool staff do like to start packing everything up around 1800 if they can get away with it.  The (window-less) gym is pretty well equipped but you have to walk out on to the street and round the corner to access it - which this reviewer found tiresome.  The rooftop restaurant offers a view of the Temple of Zeus archeological park - as well as a breakfast characterised by bain-marie mediocrity. An upside…\n",

I was surprised at breakfast that if you ask for any other coffee than a filter coffee it was extra, not encountered that before at a hotel. The breakfast, although very good, wasn't as good as most other five star hotels we have stayed at. Overall the view and location more than made up for the small flaws.\n",

They took care of all of our requests quickly and professionally. The breakfasts were amazing and the setting is exceptional. We had dinner in the restaurant on the roof two nights of our stay, the first and the last and we loved everything we had. We will definitely stay here again when we return. Just warning, some of the rooms can be a little small and not have good views. You have to be fairly specific when reserving about what you want.\n",

      "Review is :Couldn't have asked for  a better view from our balcony. We could see both the Olympian temple of Zeus as well as the Acropolis. Our room was good as well with comfortable beds and a nice and clean bathroom. The foyer of this hotel is beautiful and the patio near the pool is a great place to have a cocktail or a quick bite. The extensive breakfast on the 7th floor on the rooftop patio is very good as well. The elevators to get to your room in one wing and up and down to the rooftop restaurant are very small and painfully slow but that was my only complaint. I would absolutely stay here again, the location is awesome, 5 -10 minute walk to Acropolis and Plaka.\n",

The lobby and lounge is quite nice and front desk was ok as well. Now on to some good points; 1. The room was spacious with a beautiful view of the Temple of Zeus. The blue decorative carpet looked pretty new. 2. The room had a desk to do work and also had a small loveseat and coffee table. 3. The bathroom was big with a tub and a separate shower. 4. The room also contains an actual wall mounted power converter in the bathroom so if you have any 110v electric toothbrushes, hair straighteners or shavers they'll work here. 5.

Our room was overlooking Zeus which we loved to see and then of course the rooftop restaurant where breakfast is served you have the great view of the Acropolis.

The good points are 1) Location - Walking distance to most of attractions in Athen. 2) Rooftop restaurant- overlooking Acropolis and Zeus was amazing from this place. We had breakfast every day and I think it is one of the best view breakfast places in Athen just because of view.   Not so good points are 1) Building / room / facility - it is a bit old. 2) Pool area - it is not spacious and nice enough. In total, If you expect 5 stars, then you might be a bit disappointed but if you expect 4stars, then you will be very happy.   Value for money, I think it is a good hotel and we enjoyed a lot.\n",

I suspect that the majority of guests are like us – beginning or ending a cruise.   The hotel was overloaded during our stay and the staff was very accommodating. On the 7th floor you’ll find one of the best panoramic views of Athens. Just be prepared to share it with the crowd. I rate this place with 3 stars because of the rooms and breakfast. The rooms, especially the bathrooms, are average.    The fresh bread at breakfast buffet is the highlight but the remainder is mostly greasy steamer trays.

View: the 7th floor restaurant has a fantastic view of the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus. This is easily the best aspect of the hotel.

I thought \"internal room\" meant an inside courtyard view but it was literally just like the cruise ship internal room we had just left behind.

Breakfast is also served from this floor. Breakfast was very nice with an array of choices to suit everyone. The room in our opinion is a little dated. The bath for example is quite small and I wouldn't consider myself a large person and even I had to shower sideways as it's so small. Also the hairdryer is from the 80's I'm guessing takes forever to dry your hair with it. However the rooms were very clean and the beds comfy.

This hotel is beautiful and the decor is true Athenian style. If you're looking for an ultra modern hotel then it is not for you but it is not without its modern amenities. We stayed in an internal room and although we had no window, the room did not feel claustrophobic because of the beautiful stained glass window that you were able to light up in an evening. The air con is really cold which is great after walking miles in the hot Athens summer. Staff are extremely helpful and polite and make sure the hotel runs smoothly. Nothing is too much to ask here. The breakfast is lovely, but gets busy around 9 as it would in a hotel…\n",

Small boxed TV in the corner with probably the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept in. The walls looked like they needed painted and the bathroom was very small. The people were kind and the services they offered were very good. The location is close to the Acropolis and within walking distance to the museum. Overall would not stay there again. Deceptive pictures online concerning the rooms we purchased.\n",

The reception on arrival was offhand and snooty - we were told we had an \" internal room\" and to our horror it had no windows and seemed to be over a light shaft. We decided not to complain bc we were only staying over night but nonetheless were very shocked as had booked in January- when I mentioned this the gentleman made a very disparaging comment about having booked through Booking.com!!

This hotel is a bit deceiving for a 5-stars, but with a perfect location in the city center of Athens. The rooms are comfortable, clean, quiet and spacious. The wifi is working correctly. Only our air conditioning was too cold and difficult to understand, despite the easy in-wall control system. This wasn't much of a problem for one night, but it would have become unpleasant should we have stayed longer. My main criticism concerns the overall service impressions in the hotel, beginning with the reception hall. Arriving at the Royal Olympic doesn't feel like arriving at a 5-stars.

Its most outstanding features include an excellent rooftop restaurant, which I shall review separately, with breathtaking panoramic views that include the Acropolis and the Lycabettus Hill.  The rooms were comfortable, good-sized, and well maintained, although not ultra-luxurious.  We stayed at the hotel and both the beginning and the end of our trip.  Both rooms had a small balcony that looked upon the inner courtyard and pool, although our second room had only a stall shower, but no bathtub as had been in the first.

The hotel website advises on the ways of getting from the airport to the hotel:  Taxi at 60 euros (On our return to the airport we were quoted 40 euros by hotel staff which we booked). Metro Bus  We decided to take the Metro as we thought 60 euros rather expensive.  The Metro was crowded and our travel paperwork and my husband's passport were stolen from my handbag.

The view from the room is exquisite but let down by the fact the bed is two individual beds, separately made, and pushed together with a blanket over the top to give the illusion it is one bed.

The elevators are small and slow, the staff at the breakfast were rude, and the client computers were old and outdated.   Could be that the hotel has been renovated in 2009, but nothing seems to have been improved and/or changed since then.\n",

We were not by anyone outside the hotel, and not only had to carry our own luggage up the stairs to reception, but also were asked to take our own luggage up to our room. (Certainly no issue doing this usually...just not at a 5 star hotel when we are paying 5 star rates!)  Our room was large and clean. Bed was pretty good, but had to ask for extra pillows to be delivered to the room as we were only given 2 very thin pillows to begin with.   We went upstairs to the rooftop bar for a drink. The view was awesome! The service was really poor. The staff were very arrogant.   Breakfast was good. service was fast and there was a wide range of food. The scrambled eggs looked like bricks which were clearly overcooked. The fried eggs were much better…\n",

The rooms are OK--they are clean and everything works in the rooms, but we had a 15 inch old TV one night (not a flat screen), there were holes in the carpet, the halls need to be painted and the staff was unaccommodating. Every request we had which was 3- was met with an I'm sorry can't do that.  But for us the biggest problem was the check-in and check-out.

It has a great view of the Acropolis and Zeus temple from the restaurant terrace. At the restaurant we only had drinks and sandwiches, so I can't comment more about  the food, but the tab was quite high. There is only one elevator to go up to the restaurant and sometimes it was lengthy to reach that floor. The restaurant serves a buffet breakfast at 25 Euros per person, so we ate out  It has a pool, but not rooftop pool.\n",

The showers flooded the entire bathroom because the drains were not working. The flush toilets of the two bathrooms also did not work well and the \"natural waste\" did not drain.

The only thing this hotel compensates its guests is the location which is very close to the Acropolis.  The hotel staff are not too friendly either.  Breakfast is not bad and it provides a nice view of the Parthenon.  For the price of  $300 a night, it should have a better bed, much less, steady water heater.

      "Review is :This hotel is in an excellent central location for the main attractions of Athens and is opposite the Temple of Zeus. The views from the rooftop terrace restaurant and bar are stunning especially the Acropolis when it is lit up at night.  The staff are extremely professional, friendly and courteous and were very helpful to us when one of our suitcases broke prior to us setting off to the airport.  The breakfasts which are served in the roof top terrace restaurant are excellent with a wide choice.  The hotel lobby is impressive and stylish. Our executive  room was spacious with a balcony and clean though the style is rather dated. The swimming pool area is lovely, with a large swimming pool and sun beds.  I would highly recommend this hotel especially for easy access to the…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at this hotel for three days during our recent excursion to Greece. We really appreciated the superb location <can literally walk to the Acropolis and Museum as well as adjacent to the Plaka(sp) area>. The view off the rooftop restaurant/lounge/breakfast area is nothing short of spectacular and worth staying here just in itself! The breakfast also was superb and one of the best we enjoyed. While had a few drinks in the lounge didn't eat in the restaurant as numerous much more reasonably priced options available close by (two short blocks).          We also found the room to be quite nice, excellent bed, relatively spacious size wise, nice balcony <inner pool view>, AC worked fine, no issues with WiFi, mini fridge, and in-room safe. Wasn't a whole lot of storage space…\n",

The pool with it´s service was great, and the hotel and room was really luxurious.  The only minus is that the elevators was small and slow, but it was many of them!\n",

      "Review is :We stayed four nights in an \"Acropolis-view room\", which was spacious and well-appointed, with a lovely balcony from which we could see the Acropolis if we looked left. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to most sites and the restaurants of the Plaka for evenings. However, there were only two electrical outlets for charging electronics and plugging in my curling iron, and those were in ridiculously inconvenient locations, nowhere near a mirror for my hair and requiring us to unplug lamps each time to use them. On top of that frustration, the hairdryer provided was wall-mounted and old with little power, and we had trouble throughout with a shower that either ran way too hot or barely lukewarm. Finally, over four days we had used the glassware in the room a bit,…\n",

The doorman-who was excellent, corteous and helpful worked hard to let us park and let me in. He was the first to utter the apologetic mantra \"that is the hotel policy\" which was repeated by over half a dozen employees over a 24 hours stay. Reservation was booked over a month earlier, I arrived at 2pm and was told \"your room is not ready yet, will be ready in 30 minutes\".

The room was adequate but lacked the finish of a 5 star establishment. Small bathroom with very basis fittings. Very surprising was the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room as I do like a cup of tea first thing in the morning. I would recommend the hotel but it's not 5 star in my view.\n",

The best things about the hotel are the location (directly across from Zeus's temple) and there is a stunning view from the restaurant to the Acropolis. It is also very walkable to many of the key sites of the city. The price is also very competitive for a 4 - 5 star hotel. I found all the staff to be very helpful. The rooms themselves are adequate but fairly basic but this was not an issue for me as I was only in the room to sleep. A very good experience overall and I would return to the hotel for either another company evnt or if on personal travel.\n",

The rooms were decent , but not what I would have expected from this level of hotel. The breakfast was reach enough, and being served on the last floor with the balcony facing the grand view, it felt alike one could sit and relax for longer (early meetings prohibited from actually enjoying the experience. The small pool offers a quite place away from the busy streets, and only the lifts seem to belong to another era - being so slow and not fully connecting all hotel wings. Overall - a good enough choice , especially if you intend to spend most of your days outdoors... just step out and enjoy the neighborhood (the Plaka is just a minute walk).\n",

We were too tired to care as we'd just got off an overnight flight.  It looked better after we woke up from our naps, but I was still disappointed.

Awesome swimming pool. Not quite a complaint, but the water in the pool was VERY cold! But once in there it was great.  The only thing that I wasn't impressed with was the gym.The bench press was pretty dangerous as the hooks didn't slot in correctly. Luckily my partner was there or I may have been in trouble.

The room was spectacular and came with a massive private balcony. The rooftop bar and restaurant has one of the most incredible views of the Parthenon, especially at night. I did think the drinks were a little pricey at the bar, but the view was really worth the extra Euros.  The pool has ample space around it to lounge, but it is nothing extravagant.

The water pressure in the shower is fairly weak. But, of course you're not in Athens to watch TV. There's a fairly nice swimming pool, but we didn't use as we were there in late April when the weather is just perfect for walking and touring.

Room is not to 5 star quality, no iron,or coffee/tea making facilities.  Bathroom - Beware ,DANGEROUS SHARP EDGE ON DOOR ENTRANCE. Would not expect to see a shower curtain in a so called 5star hotel. Breakfast room- yes has a great view . BUT  hot food was stone cold at 7:15 am only opened at 7am. We were kept waiting at the entrance until 7:15 until they opened the door. This happened both mornings of our stay. To summarise this hotel should not be rated as a 5 star in our opinion. We are well traveled…\n",

There was a minor incident with a hotel administrator.

This is an average hotel, 3 stars MAX. It desperately needs a full renovation in the rooms and hotel amenities.  Breakfast buffet is alright, nothing special.  Staff is friendly and helpful. We had to move rooms because it was too hot and barely any ventilation because the AC system was shut off. We were told it was because of the cold weather (18 degrees Celsius) and that was also the excuse we received for the restaurant tables not being on the terrace with the view. Very disappointing\n",

It's only a five minute walk to the road that goes up to the Acropolis and to the Plaka area, so very conveniently placed. Lots of restaurants in that area ,even in February that are open. Only complaint and that's as it's a 5 star hotel it would have been nice to have tea/coffee making fascilities in the room. Also ,the room walls were a little thin.

We requested airport pickup (I highly recommend this to all) which made our ride to the hotel smooth one after a long flight. We were greeted by Yannis at the front desk who checked us in and within minutes we were off to our room.

The bathroom was old and the toilet flush sounded like an airplane coming in to land. Our neighbors flushing in the night woke us twice. We could also quite clearly hear the baby next door but as she was part of our party luckily it didn't bother us. The mattress was comfy but the pillows rock hard (foam filled?) and old fashioned blankets. I think this hotel is in need of a complete refit.\n",

Unfortunately, it became clear to us that our luggage whilst open in the hotel room had been searched and that a USB  (with personal items on) stolen along with a small amount of cash we left in my trouser pocket. We didn't realise this had happened until we checked out and found that the internal pocket of the holdall had been unzipped and USB stolen.  We reported it to the hotel whose response was to question the long serving chambermaid  who of course denied all knowledge. 2 days after leaving Athens someone was trying to hack our personal email accounts  and we were receiving numerous requests for passwords.

Focusing solely on the accommodation, the Royal Olympic is worth the price premium.  Huge rooms with first rate bathroom.  No wear and tear visible (though cigarette smoke made its way in somehow?)  Busy street with a fabulous view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus but noise and light were respectively shut out by (i) 4 layers of glass and (ii) heaviest grade of roller blinds I've ever seen.

      "Review is :The hotel is a bit old style with very friendly staff. My room had an old style tv but according to my colleagues this is not the case of all rooms. The room was excellent; nice bed, marble bathroom and a balcony. The location is close to Acropolis and in walking distance of Parliament and the Plaka. The view from the roof garden to the Acropolis is magnificent: both at day and at night when dining. Only minus is too few elevators and some missing amenities at the room which gives the rate of 4.\n",

Beyond that, the breakfast was nothing to write home about. The eggs in particular were less than appetizing. And if you're wanting to wind down for the night in your room, good luck! The only English speaking channels were CNN and BBC. Forget wanting to watch any movies...there were none. Lastly, if you want to get in a quick workout, forget it! ALL THE MACHINES WERE BROKEN....YES, ALL OF THEM. For a 5 star hotel, Royal Olympic left something to be desired.\n",

The hotel itself was extremely clean and well maintained. Our room however, was outdated and smelt musty, but we weren't inside for very long anyway so this was not problematic for us!

Location was perfect for sightseeing.  Acropolis and Musuem are a short walk away, as are many traditional restaurants and shops.  It was really excellent, and I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't leave with a satisfied smile.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed here several nights on vacation, two different rooms. Easily a five star. Wonderful location, great views from the restaurant, nice people, very clean. But technology lags: * Free, but slow wi-fi. (Can get faster, but costs.) * Only one free a.c. plug in the room. One has to unplug a lamps to get more. (Other hotels help by putting small power strips or 3-way socket splitters.) * Clock on TVs cannot be corrected. (Ever heard of black tape?) * TV channels weak (analog?), but this problem seems to be common in Greece.\n",

      "Review is :I had stayed at the Royal olympic hotel four/five years ago when i had visited with friends and i have to say at the time i found it had amazing guest services, rooms were large and the location was amazing. I decided to book in again this year- october 2016, to celebrate my fathers 60th birthday with our family and friends. The quality had drastically gone down, rooms feel very old now and not a single renovation has been done in all these years. Not only that but nobody was friendly or too helpful with anything barring one or two people who were nice eg: the doorman who got us a taxi was nice but it stops there. For my fathers birthday, It was hillarious that they were happy to give us cake and flowers but then sent an email to tell us that they would charge 45 Euros for it…\n",

The bathroom had smell of damp. We were couple but they gave us two single beds!!  It ruined our stay in Athens. It was suppose to be my birthday and our first night together in Athens. What a disaster !!  The view from roof was excellent but we were told to leave as there was private party. Clearly hotel does not care about all customers equally   The staff was good but hotel overall was not good I'm sorry to say. You are better of staying at alternative hotel.   Only positive I have is the breakfast and view from roof ( if ur allowed to sit there )   Considering ur paying top price .. I was very disappointed.\n",

If there was a disappointment it was breakfast. Although the rooftop breakfast room had spectacular views, the service was decidedly average. If only some of the staff could maybe smile at a guest occasionally rather than just at each other or their phones. The 'hot' food at breakfast was cold. Come on guys, if you're going to serve hot food like bacon and eggs, at least try to keep them warm. We had breakfast twice and the these items were stone cold on each occasion.

There is no information in the room about any of the hotels amenities, room service or Athens. Nor bathrodes or slippers as you expect in a 5 star.

Location is great, right by the Acropolis entrance and it's close to Plaka, a favourite area of mine. If looking for Syntagma, it's about a 10-15 walk.  This hotel roof bar is one of the most beautiful I have visited. Very inviting with large cushioned seats, warm torches and fires, a perfect setting to sit and look at the Acropolis overhead.  I would recommend this hotel to others.\n",

We were there for two days; view from restaurant is as many have stated lovely and the hotel location is excellent. Food for breakfast was decent but unexceptional; the restaurant was overpriced and not appealing for lunch or dinner. The room was quiet, at least as to outside noise with a nice firm bed; the air system barely operated even at maximum fan strength and the lowest temperature setting; consequently we were uncomfortably warm all night.

The hallway to our room looked like it was carpeted in 1980 the carpet was so raggedy and had so many lumps and rolls in it. The room felt outdated he plumbing and bathroom were also outdated! Since we had just left France, and did so much walking, and then came to Greece, we decided to do the spa treatment. The spa is a hotel room! Once we walked in and saw what it was we should have cancelled! It was ok but not what we were expecting for the price! I would not recommend nor would I stay in this hotel again!!!!\n",

Our first day, we were able to get great street gyros, see the Temple of Zeus, and shop on the \"almost pedestrian\" only strip. It's conveniently located next to the Acropolis, and it's roof top view of the Acropolis for dinner made it so worth it.

It is the most beautiful roof top I have ever set foot on and the view is to die for. Whether you're having breakfast, dinner or just want a drink at the bar.. You need to visit this. Breakfast is held here every morning and they also do dinner. The cocktails are divine!!! Customer service is ok, the staff who work during breakfast seem like they don't want to be there (but it's a buffet, so you don't really need to deal with them unless you want coffee), but the bartenders and staff who work during dinner are much more pleasant to deal with.

      "Review is :We checked in on 24 Sept and arrived at the hotel by lunch time.  I know check in time isn't until 3 pm but I politely asked the front desk agent if he could rush one of our 2 rooms as I was not feeling well getting off a very long flight.  He said he will try as they were fully booked - he was unsympathetic with my plight.  Now, I worked in the hospitality industry for 12 years and am very well versed with front desk operations.  Check out time is at 11 am.  By noon, there should be at LEAST 1 room available.  None the less, we left our bags and went out to have lunch.  at 2pm, I called the hotel to see if any one of our rooms were available, still it wasn't.  Fine.  Checked in at a little past 3pm and the gentleman who assisted us was the only nice and warm person I…\n",

The location of this hotel, a short walk from the Acropolis Museum and Placa, is the only good thing going for it.  I chose it because of the reviews and pictures published but in reality the place is nowhere near as good.  Trip Advisor pictures show large corridors and lovely seating areas which did not feature in our part of the hotel.  The seating areas were roped off with \"Keep Off the Carpet\" signs and the corridors were small and pokey.  On arrival the staff were functional but not very friendly.  Nor were they in a mood to make conversation.  We had booked an executive room with kingsized bed.  The bed was indeed kingsize but filled the room so there was no space for the promised desk or even an…\n",

Luckily the reception and pool area are decorated to a high standard and offer a great places to relax and the roof terrace where breakfast is served was large and offered fantastic views of the city. The buffet breakfast was excellent with a huge choice and even though it was busy, the staff still offered a friendly service. It was a few minutes walk from the hotel to the Acropolis and surrounding cafes and restaurants and there is a metro station nearby so the hotel is well located for tourists and offered a few areas for conferences too, just don't stay…\n",

The rooftop bar/ restaurant was beautiful with an incredible view of the Parthenon and the Acropolis! The food was great too!! The hotel was a five minute walk from the Parthenon and five minutes from a strip of restaurants! We would stay here again!\n",

However, we found it funny that our early check-in proposal was overlooked and we had to wait 5 hours till 3PM to check ourselves in. The hotel didn't seem to be fully booked. The staff, however, was friendly and helpful. Overall, the photos on their own site are definitely nicely edited...the hotel did actually not look and feel so modern.\n",

This was to be a special trip for my girlfriend and I and this was her first visit to Athens. Indeed the hotel faces in that direction but when checking in to the room I was allocated room 108 and I had a panoramic view of trees in front of the Temple. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk I got the same response as when I asked the poolside staff if they had any other loungers or chairs, as all were full - a shrug of the shoulders and a “tough luck” expression. This is not what one expects for a hotel purporting to be five stars. There were other minor niggles such as overpriced minibar items and…\n",

The hotel is very well-run with a beautiful rooftop restaurant & lounge which is where the morning breakfast is served.  There is also a pool which looks like it would get very little time in the sun based on its location but it's a great touch when the weather allows.  The rooms are very nice but slightly dated.  It seemed a little 1970s to us but it was still clean, neat, functional and tasteful.  The staff allowed us an extra 2 hours to check out because we had a late flight which is always a nice touch and the morning breakfast was done very, very well with an attentive staff, delicious food and great views.\n",

Decoration was classic, kind of royal-looking with golds and blues, well kept. Pool area was nice but with some mold in the pool step. Breakfast was a buffet with multiple choices, everything delicious, again excellent view. I only gave it 3 stars because it has the worst wifi signal... almost no wifi really.

      "Review is :I stayed for three nights and from beginning to end I was impressed with the seemingly effortless quality of the amenities and service. Of course the location, near the Akropolis area and Plaka, and the roof-top restaurant and bar with their breathtaking view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus nearby, the Akropolis and Lycabettos in the distance are tremendous pluses, but I also enjoyed the luxury of being in a first-rate hotel that knows what it is trying to do and does it well. Some of the rooms overlook a busy avenue, but the double glazing is effective. I was wary at first of the rooms overlooking the swimming pool, but actually they are not too noisy either. The pool, on the ground floor, loses the sun quite early in the afternoon. The service in the rooftop bar can be…\n",

It is beautiful; the ceiling in the lobby is a starlit sky at night! Every inch of the several libraries, lounges, dining rooms and guests rooms are squeaky clean. You can not beat the great location (walking distance to the Acropolis and the Platka and right across the street from Hadrian's Arch and the Temple of Zeus). The staff is amazingly helpful and friendly (Yes, if you try and check in at noon and rooms are ready at 3 you may have to wait. They have been fully booked all three times I have stayed there). Breakfasts on the roof top with the finest views in all the city leave a lasting impression...I may never be satisfied by NY brunch again.\n",

One tip- don't get the hotel to call you a taxi to the airport. Their flat rate was 40 euro but the taxi meter was only 25 euro. Even if you don't have dinner in their rooftop restaurant you have to at least have a drink or two. The views are amazing at night so highly recommend. A completely different feel from the (delicious) breakfasts in the same restaurant in the morning. Really central location which made sightseeing very easy!  Definitely recommend!!\n",

I did not give it a full 5 stars because we requested an early check-in and had to wait until 3 pm to get into our room. While I understand that they were booked to capacity and it was impossible to get us into our room sooner, they should have better accommodations for guests that are waiting for hours in their lobby for rooms to become available.

We also had to ask the staff if we were able to keep our luggage in the hotel before check in.  When we returned just before 3, staff still had to phone up to see if the room was ready.  We arrived in the room and it appeared dated and a little weathered.  The bathroom is…\n",

It's clean with good service, most of the staff are friendly specially the housekeeping and the concierge, the reception man was a bit rude. It's becoming old specially the furniture, I think it needs some renovation.  My room was small, I don't know about the other rooms. The best thing about the hotel is the rooftop restaurant overlooking the Acropolis and the temple of Zeus, what's better than that, the view was great at day and night. The food was average but I loved their bread and the service is good.\n",

Many in our tour group were not told not to go to the first elevator as using this elevator we could not access our rooms.  We should have been told this.  Elegant atmosphere.

We had stayed at another hotel for three nights earlier in the trip.  For the little bit extra that it cost to stay at the Royal Olympic it was full value.  The room was much nicer and the service was first class.  When we booked we opted for the breakfast which was the best breakfast of all the hotels that we stayed at in our 16 day vacation in Greece.  Not only was the food great, but it was on the rooftop terrace with views of the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus.  We had our last dinner of the trip on the rooftop and the great view was matched by the fantastic food.  The best calarmari that we had in…\n",

Only real problem being the chlorine level which prevents opening your eyes under water due to burning. There is also insufficient chairs & beds to accommodate for demand during the hot months.  Definitely request a room in the new part of the property as the old part is just that. Comfortable beds, but old fittings, bathrooms & a tv that never worked. The A/C barely works which is an obvious issue. The lifts are also ancient & small, but do work okay. The WiFi is okay in the common areas, however woeful in the room we were in.

We had booked 6 rooms and each room was a problem ! And we were told that the Air-conditioning was working at it's best. Finally we gave up complaining.  The front desk needs to be a bit more polite and courteous.  We asked if we could have a breakfast box on the day of check out as we were leaving early. They refused ! But offered only tea or coffee instead. Found that strange as normally cold cuts/cheese/breads etc are always ready! But I would like to thanks the servers on that morning who were kind enough to let us have those and served us tea and coffee. Staff at the breakfast was excellent every single day.\n",

We were on the same floor as previous but our room was on the opposite side, as soon as I stepped in the hallway I could smell damp and see that the walls and carpet were not up to the same standard as the other side of the hotel.

      "Review is :My wife and I stayed there for several days in mid July 2016.  Like other reviewers, we found it to be a nice but ageing 'grand dame'. The location, quite close to the Acropolis trains station and surrounds ,,,(and very near to Sole Bikes e-bike tours fortunately, for us) ... was great for several days of sight-seeing around Athens. Just a short walk to the Plaka restaurants for dinner and suchlike.  The pool was a late afternoon highlight, during the hot Summer sun.  The rooftop breakfast was pretty good, but sometimes quite crowded with a ten minute wait for a table.  The Reception staff were efficient and responsive, but not overtly friendly ... they were more inclined to talk among themselves than say Good Morning.  We do hope to return one day ...

If you eat at the hotel restaurant you have a great view of the Acropolis and the temple of Zeus but the food for dinner was not great. The hotel was very affordable but seriously needs updating in the rooms. Our toilet seat in our bathroom kept sliding off, the shower had a hand held shower head but not mount to take an actual shower. The room was very hot. Next time I would stay somewhere else in this location.\n",

Well what a surprise when we walked into our room and the first thing we noticed was the musty smell! I wish we had said something about it but as we were weren't in the room a whole lot we just left it. The room we were in was outdated as was the bathroom, however it was a good size. The hotel is located in a great position where you can walk to most of the tourist attractions in less than 20 mins. The breakfast was great and the views from the rooftop were amazing.\n",

      "Review is :Our family of five stayed in this grand dame late June 2016. It remains an elegant hotel in a remarkable location within Athens. Close to all the attractions, eateries, bars and the Acropolis, the hotel offers good service, excellent breakfast food, quite a decent pool for the entire family and the most brilliant bar/restaurant/breakfast area one could truly wish for. The rooftop views of Athens and the ancient ruins, especially the Parthenon is priceless. The rooms however are barely average and need improving universally - the aircon and micro fridge all take longer than 24-Hours to actually become cool. We stayed in two Executive rooms, a triple and a double, very small yet common for the area. Cleanliness is quite good. Our rooms were adequate, though in need of…\n",

The central A/C doesn't work in any of the rooms. We changed are room 3 times, but still it was pathetic. The only good point I could find is the location of this hotel, but let me tell you, there are many hotels which have good location around this hotel. The manager at the front desk are always busy and never have time to sort issues of the customers. Not just us, I saw many customers coming to the front desk and complaining about various things. I would strongly NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. I am sorry to be so critical, but after staying in other hotels in Greece, this experience was a total disaster.\n",

The hotel was in such a great location - from our bed we could clearly see the Temple of Zeus around 100m away. The Acropolis was also very close - probably around 350m walk! The hotel had fantastic staff who were super helpful. Our booking included buffet breakfast which was delicious - imagine eating breakfast across from the Temple of Zeus and Acropolis! Our room was huge for 2 people and the complimentary bottle of wine was a nice touch. Will stay here again when I'm next in Athens. The best value for money hotel during my whole trip.\n",

The breakfast is majestic not because the buffet its extraordinary but because the view it's just wow, they really won for the breakfast spot. All the rest minor just don't count for us, when you can deliver that kind of meal.  Please do go early at the breakfast so it won't be a line to be seat and you can enjoy the calm of the momentum.  Nice pool after a long day of walking around athen it's like te oasis. Big room great bed lovely interiors. Friendly staff not outstanding tough. Highly reccomend this hotel for the location as well.\n",

      "Review is :This is a superb hotel. Beautifully appointed and we couldn't fault the service. Staff are extremely friendly and attentive. The gem of this hotel is the view. Book a panorama room which overlooks the Temple of Zeus and the Acropolis and Parthenon off to the left. You have your own balcony to sit on and take it all in. Magnificent. Just a step away from the tourist bus hop on hop off stops. We were having 40C days so the less walking, the better. Breakfast was a huge buffet and dinner on the roof top terrace restaurant was superb.  The rooms are a little small but charmingly furnished. The balcony is a bonus. Only little negative is the air con. We needed it to be an oasis to come back to and it was cool but possibly needed it to be cooler. Apart from that we found it superb.\n",

      "Review is :If you do anything in Athens it needs to be dinner at the top of the Royal Olympic Hotel!   We felt extremely relaxed and satisfied with the atmosphere, food and overall hospitality of the hotel and restaurant.   The restaurant has a beautiful view of the Acropolis and it is best to have dinner from about 7pm (summer). This way you can see it in full sun light (without the harsh heat), during sunset and at night when they light it up. We stayed here one night and reserved a table about an hour beforehand. We had the perfect spot on the balcony in the middle.  As usual we went for the traditional dishes and asked the very patient and helpful waiter for advice. We decided to get a veal and  creamy pasta dish and the slow cooked lamb. We savoured every bite of these meals as they…\n",

The “thermostatic” shower was hot one minute and cold the next and the shower cubicle was tiny.  There was a wardrobe and two tiny drawers, but not a shelf in sight.  Where were we meant to put our clothes, let alone two suitcases?   Even the television was 20 years out-of-date – a tiny CRT set, not the flatscreen that one normally sees in even the cheapest hotels.   There was no ironing board and they charged €7 to iron (not press) a jacket.

Breakfast was better.  The main criticism isn't the room though, it was the complete lack of sincerity...they couldn't less if we had a good stay...the place is so busy it's a full on churn and burn. A slightly less important criticism is lack of phone chargers, they were thankfully very good about letting me charge behind the desk.

These rooms are located in an older part of the hotel that apparently have yet to be renovated. Rooms are not exactly clean! Washrooms smell.

This hotel has a wonderful pool area and just lovely decor and grounds.  It is truly an impressive and stately building!

The bed was comfortable, the windows were sound proof (so thick they could be bullet proof!) and the bathroom was very well appointed. The wifi was fast and reliable in the room, but on the balcony was spotty, possibly due to the double glazed Windows I mentioned.

A few minutes walk to the left are the pedestrian streets of the Plaka, the Acropolis museum (amazing) and the entrance to Acropolis site. Also a leisurely walk to the ancient stadium and the national gardens for a shady journey up to the Syntagma square area.

Our children and my sister had a triple room which was perfectly comfortable, but small (compared to our suite)... and only had a view of the pool area. The location of the hotel…\n",

The position of the hotel means that you will get direct sunlight up until 3pm. The hotel seemed to be popular for functions, there seemed to be a wedding on when we were there. Room was a little basic but this was fine as we weren't in the room too often. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is very central to the Acropolis and other ancient ruins and the busy nightlife of Plaka district, both within walking distance.\n",

With fantastic breakfast views and easy access to the main sites and tourist spots you will not be disappointed with this hotel. The service was great too and the rooms very comfortable and nice and quiet. I was nervous about the breakfast as had read poor reviews previously but I couldn't complain, they had lots of options and all delicious! The only bad thing and I'm really trying to think of one is the lift, there's not an easy access staircase so the lift often gets full quickly during breakfast time but that's really not a big deal.

The Bell Man only brought our luggage to the lobby, not our rooms.   The breakfast was extensive but all the hot food was cold.

The staff are friendly, the lobby is opulent and the rooms are nice. There's nothing 'wrong' with the hotel, but its certaily not what we are used to for 5*. The rooms are pretty basic, there is no iron and ironing board and no facility for making hot drinks (which we have been used to in lower star rated hotels across Europe).

We took a piece of fresh fruit from the daily offerings each day to have in the afternoon.  The pool is lovely after a hot day of walking around. The prices are more like an American big city hotel in a downtown location rather than a local pension, but it was really nice to come back to a beautiful hotel with great beds at the end of the day.

If the food provided was any indicator as to what a 'normal' guest would get, then it's excellent.  Restaurant prices are steep compared to what else I found in Athens - but this is a 5 Star place - do it goes with the territory. Lovely rooftop bar with classic views - but a local beer is 6.50Euro - so the view comes with a premium.  With a good special offer, I'd certainly use this place again - but would urge them to invest in a decent satellite provider for the TV and why no TV/Coffee making in the rooms?\n",

The only drawback is that it is on a VERY busy street, but to their credit - there was no street noise in our room.  Also, the showers were very slow to drain so it pooled up - but that didn't bother us too much.  We definitely got great value on this stay.\n",

The second stay room (arranged through a tour) was much better and had a small balcony.  The desk has a bi-lingual service to make calls for us in Greek.  They also printed boarding passes for us and held our luggage when we arrived early and left late.  The ground-level pool was nice, but closed much too early in the evening.

We actually thought they were remodeling the hall but now understand it was permanent.  Air conditioning was poor. Room was too hot to sleep and too noisy with windows open. Shower had no curtain so bathroom floor was wet and slippery.  Would not recommend.\n",

However once you hit your room you come down with a bang. As others have stated you don't get a room as shown in their glossy website. Our first room was 503 and when we entered I could have cried. It had a mismatch of old brown furniture a horrible gold bed cover that looks as if it had been there since ancient Greece. Plug sockets hanging of the walls. The bathroom was dirty with a shower that was no use to anyone. We did complain to staff but they said they couldn't move us as there was a conference on and all rooms were booked out.

There were 3 of us and our room was very large with sitting area and changing area. The bathroom was almost as large with a separate bath and shower room. Very decadent. The service is a bit hit or miss as other reviewers have noted especially when you come from the islands where service is extraordinarily. I would certainly return to this hotel as the location is ideal (walking distance to park, Acropolis, Plaka, Zeus temple, stadium etc) and views are incredible. From the 7th floor dining area you see the Acropolis, Zeus temple and city. Exactly what I wanted when I came to Athens!\n",

On my arrival (after a long flight) I found the shower broken, and it couldn't be fixed till the following morning. Reception staff service was very mixed - some staff very friendly and others dismissive bordering on rude. Breakfasts are served on the terrace with fabulous views of the ancient sights, and the food is good.  But again, the level of staff friendliness was very mixed.

The moment we entered we saw tons of luggage placed at the inside entrance of the lobby on two sides. This itself gave a very busy and chaotic feel to the hotel. So next you can only expect a busy reception and poor customer service. We reached at about 1:30pm and was told that our room will only be available at 3pm. This was fine since the check in was 3pm anyways. So we went to the restaurant upstairs to have lunch and it was massively full as there was 5 conferences being held in the hotel. Finally we went to the restaurant across the street. Once back at 3pm the reception guy told us that the room was still unavailable and was pretty rude. He just told us…\n",

The hotel is on the less popular side of a very busy road in a neighbourhood that I did not feel particularly comfortable going out alone in.   Hotel staff are very serious and need to learn how to smile.  While the ground floor lobby area appears quite grand, this feeling of quality stops at the lifts, which are old fashioned, slow and quite small.

The room size was generous but ours was windowless! No matter, if your are spending most of your time sightseeing or shopping, and only your hotel room to retire in the late evening , you will forget about the window.

The rooms were past their best, the bathroom had an \"interesting\" layout, but the maid service was good. i had a room with a nice terrace, but without a view to match, and as it overlooked the main road was exceptionally noisy - but the room itself was quiet with the doors closed. The roof terrace bar had a superb view, although it was rather let down by service - although it seems that this is par for the course in Athens. The food in the restaurant (also on top floor) was of a high quality. The gym was small and tired. The pool was ok - very deep at 3.5m - but it didn't seem to catch all of the sun and there was limited sunbeds in the sun. The building is large and there…\n",

Had a smokey room with no view.  I guess there is a difference of opinion on what defines deluxe room.  Asked front desk for a shoe horn as I forgot mine and was told all 3 were loaned out.  King bed is basically 2 twins pushed together with separate bedding.  Elevators unusable as very long waits.  Hotel is dated and overpriced.  View from restaurant to Acropolis was only positive.  Breakfast only average.  Recommend to spend your $ elsewhere.\n",

Having come from such a lovely hotel in Santorini, my husband and I were looking for a decent hotel in proximity to most things in Athens.  As far as location goes - this was pretty good and has a lovely rooftop bar with views of the acropolis, etc. - although you have to buy sub-par food for like $100k (check-out the view, but no need to eat).  In general I found the hotel unaccommodating across the board - we arrived slightly early (2:00PM) and were not able to check-in our room (I get it, we were early, so no big deal) - but had requested a non-smoking room to find we were given a REALLY smoky room (what hotels in…\n",

Third, the check-in was extremely slow without minimum instructions given. Fourth, they told us the breakfast is located at xxx and the timing. We did not book with breakfast. Other hotels will ask if we want to upgrade or purchase breakfast at discounted price.

The rooftop restaurant is beautiful with magnificent views of the Acropolis and another nearby ruin-- feels like you can almost touch them. The hotel staff, mostly men, were attentive and responsive.

The hotel is very convenient to explore the Plaka and the Acropolis, especially the Acropolis Museum. The pool was also appreciated by our kids! The highlight was the rooftop restaurant for a great breakfast with views of the Acropolis, and my husband and I also enjoyed a quick dinner there one night. I'd recommend this hotel.\n",

Checking in we were given no explanations of where things were we had to find our room in the maze of corridors that make up this hotel.  We dined once for a special occasion on the roof top restaurant only to find there were two large bookings of 90 and 150 people with not enough staff to cope. The food is expensive and the menu very limited with no sign of any help for the staff to deal with such large numbers we were left to chase waiters to pay our bill and help ourselves to our wine.

I e mailed the hotel to ask but didn't get a response and it was too late to switch hotels.  When we arrived we were greeted by a plethora of men in uniform and plenty of desk staff. Despite arriving an hour early, our room was ready and they let us check in. So far so good. The reception and rooms off it are very sumptuous but tellingly no fresh flowers anywhere - all plastic.

Very clean rooms with quite comfortable beds and royal interior design. Friendly stuff and although the pool area was being under construction indeed, nevertheless this did not create any difficulties or noisy environment.

To keep things simple, here is my verdict as bullet points, first the good:  Good location for the relatively few sights to see in ATHENS Grand entrance Lovely rooftop restaurant with excellent views Clean Rooms Big comfortable beds Lots of mirrors in the room  Now the bad:  Unsafe taped up wire straight out the wall to power the bedside lamp - this should have been a wall socket and plug arrangement - definitely not 5 star electrics! - Beware if you have children who might unpick the tape of the electrical joint! Rooms too hot with no way of controlling the temperature Very noisy both from outside and neighbouring rooms bathrooms No tea / coffee making facilities Hairdryer in bathroom…\n",

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They offer free wifi and they also do currency exchange.  there are also money exchange places and banks in the area. we went on a bank holiday so I don't know the exchange rate and commission charges. My friends and I went to breakfast mistakenly believing that breakfast was included because thats what we requested from our travel agent. Breakfast was on the enclosed rooftop balcony with an amazing view of the acropolis that looked exactly as the pictures. Breakfast was buffet style and the food WAS delicious it included continental but also had egg, sausage, and spinach…\n",

But there are some shortcomings, the mirrored doors of the wardrobe are broken and there is mould in the bathroom. The staff are not attentive, very short bound and arrogant.  For the guests which leave the hotel before the breakfast, there's nothing except cookies and coffee. After asking there offered us a breakfast package for € 12 per person and this also without any sandwich included. The response we got is \"this is not our hotel policy\".\n",

The room was  nice and serviced daily (be sure to use the do not disturb signs - as the housekeeping staff are enthusiastic).

The room was very well appointed, again spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, in fact EVERYTHING in the room was just great.  Breakfast was good but could have been hotter, the introduction of warm plates would be a big help in overcoming this. And now to put my caterers head on, I feel that the lighting at the breakfast buffet let it down somewhat, it looked good but it would look GREAT with  the introduction of some extra lighting.

This is the reason one visits Athens and this hotel is perfect for that. In addition to the location, the hotel has a lovely pool. This is a wonderful asset as it is extremely hot in Athens and it's awesome to have a pool to jump into after the boiling hot hike through the Acropolis. I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

After I complained I was relocated to room with a window, at an additional price of course, but the door wouldn't lock and the safe was broken. Couldn't be bothered to move rooms again as the staff made me feel like I was being an inconvenience. To top it all off, bought a Nescafe at a price of 11 euros.

      "Review is :A friend and I spent 3 nights at the Royal olympic hotel as part of a deal with an airline. From trip advisor we thought it would be ok. What we found was fantastic!  The staff are friendly, professional and always available. The hotel features are very grand in themselves. Whilst you have to walk around 200m outside the hotel proper to get to the gym, it has an impressive array of different equipment and is well stocked with water and towels. The one weakness is probably the bedrooms whilst clean and comfortable with good facilities they're not quite up to the grand standard of the rest of the hotel.  However without doubt the stand out feature of the hotel is the sky restaurant/bar/breakfast area with excellent decor, open fires, great ambience and the most astonishing views…\n",

I put the air con on and for a very expensive, poor quality dinner on the top floor(I would avoid..). Came back and the room had not cooled down, there is no window in the room so couldn't let fresh air in.   Called reception and they said air con works every hour for a while, I said I had been at dinner for over an hour and still not working, then I was told it was turned off for the winter!  Got a transfer to room 530, lot better but still poor, shabby and a bit dirty.  Watch out on your bill as I was charged a sneaky €15 for parking but never told there was a charge.  It is a good location and breakfast was good.\n",

We keep choosing this hotel because the location is perfect, the rooms are awesome, hotel is super clean, staff are so accommodating and it's priced right.  We have only stayed 2 nights minimum as we use this hotel as a stop before we head home to Canada.  We have been very fortunate to have been upgraded both times when booking.  First time we booked we opted for the De Luxe Room and when we arrived they upgraded us to the Athenian Panorama.  Our 2nd time there we booked the Executive Room and were upgraded to the Junior Suite.  We will always stay here when in Athens because the location cannot be beat.  The beds are very comfortable.

The executive room comes with a \"view\" and we had a view of a brick wall for another hotel.   The staff are extremely rude and very unhelpful.

The view from the rooftop restaurant is definitely breathtaking and I enjoyed going there every morning to enjoy a buffet style breakfast.  The breakfast was consistently pretty good each day but I wouldn't say it was the very best I have had at a hotel.  The location is definitely excellent as it was within very close distance to Plaka and overall very central to things by cab.  We stumbled across other hotels within walking distance and I felt we made the best choice given what we had seen in passing.  Overall, the customer service was good.

The stay was still very confortable and breakfast on the roof was great. The rooms are large with decent beds and the basic toiletries. However I would say skip the restaurant at night, the food is now reminiscent of an expensive grill, not the refined and decadent experience of a few years ago.   As for the staff, to be honest we felt overlooked. Whilst I had informed them of my plans, there was no effort to make our stay a romantic experience and even the table…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed here as part of tour as many people have previously mentioned. Stayed 2 times, a week apart. First time got a teeny room in the back on the first floor. Perfectly adequate: king sized bed, updated bathroom and had a nice sunny balcony with chairs which were perfect for afternoons. The nice part about being on the first floor was being able to avoid the elevators which were slow and don't offer a lot of capacity. The second stay got a room in the front on the 3rd floor. Can't beat the view--which is the same as the 7th floor restaurant and bar: Temple of Zeus, the Acropolis and Hadrians' Arch. Wowsa. The 2nd room, on the 3rd floor, was a suite with seating area, 5 piece bath, king sized bed and a control panel with automatic shutters. This must be how the \"other half\"…\n",

The reception area and rooftop restaurant are 5* but the rooms that don't look onto the temple are really not up to standard.  I was allocated room 618.  It looks onto other rooms (the hotel is a u shape).  The mattrass was dead and hard.  When I sat on one side, it went onto the base.  I rolled over in the night and nearly fell out of the bed.  I took a photo of the huge dip in the mattrass.  I sat in both chairs and they too were dead.  The bathroom was clean but hadn't been renovated either.  Shower curtains don't belong in a 5* hotel.

However, on the return visit, because we were \"return guests\", we were given rooms on the other wing that were truly five star. They were very well decorated, faced the Temple of Zeus, and had an incredible bathroom.  Breakfast is a buffet with a good selection of hot/cold selections. Wi-fi was decent and the first floor pool looked well maintained (it was too cold to swim).  If you visit this hotel, make sure to ask for a room in the new wing.\n",

I was upgraded upon arrival to a beautiful room with a view of the pool and a window that opens (which is lacking in a lot of the bigger hotels). The room was clean, spacious and extremely comfortable with a TV, fridge, safe, large double bed, bathrobe, air-conditioning/heating, clean carpet and strong wifi.

The hotel is perfectly located very close to Plaka, the Acropolis Museum, walking distance from the Acropolis entrance and in front of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. It's also about 1 1/2 blocks from the stop of the Hop-on Hop-off bus, which we used in Athens, The breakfast was magnificent. Perhaps the difference is the room. We reserved an Athenian Panorama room, which is a very big room, suite style with a magnificent view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus in front. I took pictures from my room at all hours and it was simply magnificent. If you can, reserve this type of room, it worth it.\n",

They have a point. It all seems a bit 1986 and a well maintained example of what would have constituted a classy 5 star hotel at that time. Right now a 4 *+ would be a more accurate description. The rooms are in need of a bit of an update. I found the marble bathroom clean and neat but the bath and toilet again had a colour scheme from a quarter of a century ago. The room overall was nice but with this slightly faded feel. The wardrobe space was dreadful.

      "Review is :5-star hotel??  That depends on where your room is.  We’re on a tour with Gate1 and paid extra to upgrade to this hotel.  We stayed 2 nights prior to our land tour and then 1 night at the end of the tour before leaving for the islands. The first 2 nights we’re assigned a room (#549) in the old wing.  The room was tiny.  As you open the door and take 2 steps, you practically land on the bed.  To say the room is outdated is an understatement.  The carpet is old and discolored and has a big stain.  The chair and stool are also stained and filthy.  Even the garbage can is all rusted and dented.  I can pick up a better one at a garbage dump and I kid you not.  (See my pictures.)

Cons: The rooms are quite small and very outdated. AC barely worked and shower was very narrow. The pool area is in need of renovating as well.

The beds were super firm, and our \"king\" bed was really two twins pushed together, made separately with their own sheets and a bedspread covered over the two, so we couldn't even cuddle at night.  :(  And the shower was frustrating, as the drain wouldn't drain the water, so every 5 minutes you had to turn off the water to let the bottom of the shower drain before it spilled out onto the floor. (Pictured below)  If that was fixed, it would have been decent as a 4-star hotel, but I found it as a misrepresentation that they are a 5-star hotel.\n",

The top floor restaurant and bar is not to be missed for service and food but more importantly its view of the Acropolis.   There is a Lobby Bar, a Sitting Room with a Library and an outdoor pool.

The lobby looks nice, and maybe if I had been given the option to rent the penthouse or a higher level floor, the room would have been better. But when I booked 4 months prior, the only rooms they had were what I booked. It was on the second floor and dingy.

The hotel is spotlessly clean and very spacious - both rooms we had (we stayed twice) were large, comfortable and well appointed. The rooftop restaurant and bar has stunning views towards the Parthenon to the left and the Temple of Zeus in front. When floodlit at night, the view is simply spectacular. The breakfast was very good with a wide range of options - both hot and cold.  The only slight downside is the pool, which, although a good size, is on the ground level is therefore surrounded by the hotel buildings and consequently loses out a bit on the sun early in the morning…\n",

We found we could reasonably walk just about everywhere we wanted to go from the hotel - pretty much all the major landmarks and points of interest are within walking distance. There are stunning (almost surreally beautiful) views of Athens from the rooftop restaurant, where breakfast is served. Our room was comfortable and very quiet. The only negatives were the pool and poolside area (which are much too small for the number of guests in summer). (The pool was also only open from 9.30am until 8.30pm.) Sadly, as so often in Greece, service was also hit and miss, with some staff helpful and pleasant, and some not. Worth booking though, if just for the location.\n",

It is a very nice hotel, well located 5 mins from the Acropolis museum and another minute or two round to the entrance to the Acropolis. Maybe 15 min to Plaka or Constitution Square. Well appointed rooms but a quibble about the shortage of power points, especially none by the bed. Also, in peak season it takes a while to get the one lift/elevator to/from the 7th floor bar & restaurant, but it's worth the wait (and for those in the know, you can go up to the 6th floor on the other side of the hotel, walk round and then up the stairs to the restaurant).

Food quality was very good but still expensive taking everything into consideration. Be sure you don't leave going to breakfast to the last minute because come 10 am on the button - EVERYTHING is removed from the serving areas very quickly! The hotel is rated 5 star and probably just about lives up to the rating although strangely there is no shower in the ensuite only a shower head that you have to hold whilst in the bath.

Lobby is very beautiful and the view from the roof also, as for the rooms we were in not so much and definitely not what I would call luxury.

Virtually everything is in walking distance - the Acropolis is a 15 minute walk, Syntagma a 10 minute walk, the Plaka a 5 minute walk.  The Acropolis underground station is 5 minutes away, and the system is very efficient.  Rooms - I read some of the complaints about the rooms in other reviews, and they are largely correct.

Okay, maybe I should have gathered that from the price (but still a fair amount at €130 a night) but there is a stark contrast between what the hotel markets itself at and what it actually is.

The lobby area is stunning with marble floors, a library area and various sofas to relax in - but as you venture to your room it a complete contrast.  My Dad and I were in room 646, which apparently is in another building. We had to go in some ominous service-lift that groaned at every floor it crawled past.

Plus the big attraction seems to be the view of the acropolis and temple of Zeus from the rooftop restaurant. Has an indoor swimming pool, did not get to use it but looked occupied through the day. The hotel does have some quirks like the super expensive breakfast, paid EUR 50 for an average buffet. Plus be sure you know what view you get, we had a room overlooking the pool, so not so hot. Service quality was very good and the whole operation is very slick.  Definitely recommend.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed for two nights during August at Royal Olympic and over all a disappointing stay. The pool area is nice and the roof top is impressive but I would recommend staying elsewhere in Athens. The WIFI was poor and the air conditioning in our room didn't work. Whilst we complained about the aircon they offered us another room but it was exactly the same. Don't be fooled into the lobby and roof top area. It's clear no expense was spared for these areas but the rooms could do with some attention. It's a big hotel which certainly caters for families and big travel groups. At times we felt we were at a retirement village or kid club due to the clientele. Perhaps our expectations were too high but if you prefer boutique style accommodation and good basics of a hotel than I would…\n",

The views of the surrounding sites from the rooftop restaurant are awesome if you get to see them as they randomly close the rooftop for private functions.   We paid for a deluxe room and one would think looking at our pics their of a different hotel compared to The Royal Olympics marketing pics.  The room we were given was a disgrace.

When we arrived we were blown away by the glass front and 10/10 reception area. Decoration and cleanliness is a 10 without a doubt.  The concierge was very helpful with details about the area and our room. We had the basic room, luckily we had a balcony and, although the view was of a back road it was the perfect place to sit and relax for a moment or two before bed.

All I can say it is location and view from roof top restaurant is amazing Rooms are small and bathroom ceiling is horror really. First off all it is very low and dirty , covered with mold and bath curtains are old . It is worse than in 3* hotels. There is no kettle and of course tea facilities in the room, so if you need hot water as I did ( for my kids baby milk) you may call room service and it will cost you 3 or 4 Euro. The other way is to go upstairs to the restaurant and ask for it , as I did in 1 am in the morning ( luckily it was open). Roof top bar beverages are overpriced . Breakfast is good and has variety of food.\n",

After arriving in Athens following a long day of travel from Canada - we were so excited to walk into this room and crash in the bed.  We loved that the light panel beside the bed was accessible and we didn't even have to leave the bed to turn off the lights.  We say this, as we were extremely jet lagged.  Prior to diving into the bed, we did take a chance to check out the AMAZING view of the Temple of Zeus.  Breathtaking.  Unfortunately our stay consisted of mainly getting over the jet lag, so I can completely say that the bed is SO COMFORTABLE.  We did go to the rooftop restaurant in the evening, and the view of the Acropolis and Parthenon are second to none.  The only complaint is that the shower either drained slow or…\n",

It should not have been necessary to confront the staff in the first place. Overall, the staff were terrible - the only great service came from room service and the porters, who I tipped generously.

      "Review is :Arrived at this hotel to spend our final evening in Athens before flying home. The hotel location was great, close the the Acropolis Metro station and only a 10Euro taxi from Pireaus Port. The lobby is very impressive, however the rooms weren't quite 5* standard.   The rooftop bar/restaurant is by far the most impressive part of the hotel. We had dinner here, the food and service were great although slightly overpriced.  Breakfast was disappointing, we waited 15 minutes to be seated and the only only available table was a table of 4 which we had to share with another couple. The buffet selection ran to empty quite a few times and took quite a long time to be replenished - overall definatly not 5*.   I would return to this hotel again if ever in Athens, but be aware that it may…\n",

The rooms are small, the air conditioning doesn't work, the walls are thin and you can hear the upstairs neighbors. Don't get Level 5 rooms below the ballroom on a Saturday night, as wedding functions kick on to 5 am, that is if you want to sleep.  There are three star hotels that can do this better.\n",

One can reach the Hotel conveniently from the Airport by the Metro with one change over at Syntagma Square station (just 1 stop away). Clean & spacious room with complimentary wifi ! Courteous house keeping staff. Grand breakfast spread at their rooftop restaurant that offers beautiful views of the Temple of Zeus.

Room was beautiful with a Panoramic view of the Parthenon and Temple of Zeus.  Room was luxurious and big.  Staff was very friendly but not seem to go above and beyond which was disappointing.

After all how much time do you spend in your room? The pool area was gorgeous but the jewel in the crown is that rooftop. The most beautiful breakfast area ever (very awesome staff) and drinks at night to look across at the Temple of Olympian Zeus and up at the Acropolis. I don't think you could get a better location for inner Athens. Right at the Plaka as well, where there are a million market shops and eateries.

Hands down this place had the best buffet breakfast experience I have ever had in Athens the hotel had an incredible view of the Acropolis with morning sun.

The king bed that is actually two twins pushed together is a little awkward. I was traveling alone, so perhaps less uncomfortable than traveling with a companion (given the hard line in the middle of the bed where the two meet!), but it still put a cramp on stretching out and being lazy in bed. My other issue was with the cards, losing their effectiveness. I spent two nights at the hotel, and twice, my cards had to be fixed... I was a little disturbed that no one asked for id when fixing the keys instead of just reprogramming and handing back over. Those issues aside, it was a good launch pad to explore Athens.\n",

Also on arrival we were uninformed of the location of any hotel facilities including breakfast or the pool. Following this we were left to navigate the hotel ourselves with our large bags to find our room. The location and facilities of the hotel were good although would not rate the customer service. We also dined at the resteraunt which had nice food and a veiw, although was very expensive and also understaffed. Our server was very polite and helpful but the sheer volume of tables he was waiting ment a long wait time for menu requests or drinks.\n",

Unfortunately, the 'king sized bed' was actually two single beds and they weren't even zipped together - not exactly romantic. And there was no powerpoint in the bathroom which made for some noisy hairdryer-action in the bedroom. But it had an atmosphere of opulence and was remarkably clean.

      "Review is :Stayed here with my teenage daughter and my husband in June 2015. We booked a room for 2 grown-ups and a teenager. We checked in late in the evening. We were greeted nicely and professionally at the reception in a nice, clean lobby area. I quickly realized though, that they were not prepared for us to be 3, so as the receptionist started calling around to get us a room, I suggested we go up to the roof terrace bar until they had fixed our room which the receptionist found was a very good idea. The rooftop terrace houses a restaurant and a bar with fantastic view to the Acropolis. We ordered wine and our daughter wanted a cheese platter. The woman working in the bar was very sweet and helpful, but it took some time until we got our order simply because she was alone waiting all…\n",

No coffee/tea maker in room - they wanted you to call room service to have coffee in your room even though the room had a fridge and a minibar (very odd) but really loved the room overall.  We were on the 5th floor.  Rooftop restaurant is where you have the included breakfast that was very good with many choices.  A bit pricey for dinner, but a nice quiet setting with great views and good food.  The service was professional, but very stand-off-ish.  Almost no one smiled at you except a few of the waitress and doormen.  Not that they were not polite, but they just were not very friendly.

The lobby was beautiful, the pool was very nice and the restaurant on the top floor had absolutely amazing views both of the Acropolis and the Temple of Olympian Zeus. The hotel also had a very nice reading room with a view of the ruins of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, but the hotel facade outside looked very old and dirty and the room itself was also old, dated and small. The a/c didn't work the entire time I was there and I had to leave my window open every night just to cool the room down. This allowed mosquitoes to enter the room freely.

It is across from the Temple of Zeus/Hadrian's Arch and easy walking distance to the Plaka (shopping/restaurant area) and the Acropolis. We had a deluxe room which was clean and nice. It had a mini fridge which was stocked but we took a few things out to put our own drinks in there. There is a pool area on the first floor which starts off quiet but does fill up after 10am.

Trust me 5 star Isn't always better.  Stayed 21st June, 2015\n",

      "Review is :I stayed here with my husband and two friends at the beginning of May.   Our room was one of the Athenian Panorama Suites  at the front of the hotel overlooking the road with views towards the Parthenon.  Super room, comfortable bed, and absolutely no traffic noise.  The restaurant was very good, again the open air part had superb views towards the Acropolis which was within walking distance.  I was surprised at the lack of fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet, however, I did enquire and had a bowl of fruit salad prepared for me.  My only criticism of the hotel was that the swimming pool was rather small, but as this is a city hotel it's probably to be expected.  I would definitely stay there again\n",

There is a great roof top restaurant where breakfast is served whilst enjoying amazing views.  Staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble, would definitely stay here again next time I come back to Athens.  Just a few niggles small lifts and only one taking the entire hotel up for breakfast in the morning, climbing into a slippery bath to take a shower, caused a couple of nice bruises, tea is horrible but way more positives than negatives, breakfast is huge as well\n",

We stayed in Mykonos and Santorini, then had one night left back in Athens in which we stayed at Royal Olympic. Reviews seems good online, not sure how many are made up or paid for. Upon arrival staff was not friendly or warm, we ate at the restaurant which the food was decent but again staff was not very nice. The biggest surprise was when we checked into the room which was a suite looking over the temple of Zeus. The room was so tiny and there was no shower, just a tub!

The food at the restaurant was good, but the views were certainly the highlight of the evening, it's definitely worth a meal up there in the evening, however the buffet breakfast was somewhat lacking and if your a coffee lover- well be prepared to be disappointed! Staff were not overly attentive in my opinion, but perhaps as were in a large group they struggled with getting orders correct\n",

For our second 2 night stay we had a better room with a view of the Temple of Zeus, which is across the street from the hotel.  It is very conveniently located near the Acropolis and Plaka.  The staff was always very helpful and accommodating.  It was great to take a dip in the pool after site seeing.  The rooftop breakfast is plentiful and the view of the Acropolis is amazing.

The location was great - excellent proximity to the Acropolis - and the view from the top floor at the restaurant was wonderful, which is why I booked the hotel. Breakfast offered a large variety of very tasty food, and the lobby is beautiful.  We stayed in the old, basic section, which was very average, but adequate for one night's place to sleep.

The rooms are a bit small but efficiently decorated, every essential part is there, the beds are very comfortable.

The room sizes are small, dark...lighting is an issue  as they use energy saving bulbs. The quality of shower and bathroom is not 5 star. They dont even have hair dryers. They dont have iron for guests to use or provide service for that. You can't control a in your room as it's controlled centrally, don't see the point of having one in room. The staff are not helpful at all, I found them really arrogant and especially  management. The only nice thing about hotel is the view of Acropolis when you have breakfast. It's central so lots of attractions in walking distance. Personally I wouldn't go back.\n",

Since we caught a flu days before with a long vacation ahead of us we did mostly stay in our room, but what a room, a huge plate glass window where we could see the Temple of Zeus just outside our window with a balcony to get fresh air.  The service was perfect starting with bellman to the wait staff, we did mange to get to the rooftop restaurant For some wonder Greek food.  The bathroom was all marble with some more marble, very nice.  If I have to be sick outside my home this would be the place.\n",

Their wonderful breakfast is served on the rooftop with a great view of both.  The hotel is also within walking distance of the Olympic Stadium and the shops and restaurants of Plaka.  The hotel is also steps away from a major north-south bus line, which took us to city hall and the changing of the guard.  Our room was fine, nothing remarkable.  In a city like Athens who's going to spend much time in a hotel room.  The hotel also has a pool which was a plus since we visited in the summer.

The view of the Temple of Zeus, especially at night, is so worth it. According to our taxi driver on the way in, this is the only hotel in Syntagma Square that has been renovated AFTER the 2004 Olympics. It's nice, but it is done in a very classical and formal style. If you are looking for a contermporary or sleek hotel, this is not for you. The room was huge and the bathroom was all marble and very nice.  We were a bit surprised that our king bed was actually two twins pushed together . . . so just be warned about that one.   The hotel is very centrally located.

The room has the bare minimal, one towel of each size, no complimentary water bottles or tea/ coffee maker, and they do not have iron and ironing table which was a bit of a problem as I had packed a lot of summer dresses.

We booked the Athenian Panarama room and whilst it is expensive if you can afford it it is well worth the expense. The huge picture window overlooks the temple of Zeus which is illuminated at night and it also has a balcony large enough to sit out on, although I have to say the seating left a little to be desired. Come on hotel, for the price of the room don't let the cost of better seats ruin what is a wonderful experience at your hotel.It is truely magical sitting out a night looking at the temple.  If you can't afford the Panarama room you get a similar experience from the wonderful open air terrace restaurant from which you have the same view of the temple and can also…\n",

It was included as part of our travel package to Greece, hosting us 1 night before and 2 nights after our cruise to the Greek Isles.  This is a very nice hotel with an excellent, central location. It is located across from the Temple of Olympian Zeus and within short walking distance to all the other main tourist sites as well as the Plaka district for restaurants and shopping.  For our first night, the hotel upgraded our room, which had a stunning view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Acropolis from our balcony. It really made for a wonderful first night in Greece.

Downsides... at checkin the staff took my passport and processed my cjeckin without a hello or an acknowledgement of my existence. When we went up to the bar again the service was poor and rude. The upgraded room we recieved didnt have a window to outside.

Staff were friendly, particularly those in the rooftop bar (though one or two were less than cheerful on reception). Overall great value for a 5* hotel, would come again.\n",

      "Review is :Location - Excellent, overlooks Temple of Zeus, Acropolis to left and a lot of the city. Well maintained - The hotel has a feel of class and sophistication, but also comfort. Food - Breakfast was amazing, excellent range of quality hot/cold food and plentiful.            - Dinner was very tasty, and a lovely experience on the rooftop restaurant, but             only did this 1 night as it was exceptionally pricey. Parking - considering you are in the city centre, and parking is difficult to say the least,                 hotel parking is essential. This is in the basement of the hotel, and seemed to                 be manned all of the time which was good. But not free ($15 per day). Room - OK. Nothing to write home about, but has all the essentials, and was clean.              …\n",

Very OLD, and besides that, bed matresses were hard like ROCK as a result we could not be able to sleep any night! And on top of it, the pillows were so small and thin it felt like there was no pillow. Even the slippers that are suppose to have the hotel brand on in and the freebies as well, it was all irrelevant and bad quality.   Room very old, dirty carpet, small, hard bed, old fashined bed cover (no duvet), wifi would stop working every some time.  Not suggesting it.\n",

The views from where you eat breakfast are amazing. I would recommend avoiding eating in the sun, it gets very hot and after that breakfast becomes not so enjoyable.   Pool was nice for sunbathing, didn't use the actual pool much because there was usually a few people around.   Didn't interact with the staff much, only when checking in/out. They kept to themselves.   Overall, clean and tidy hotel, I found it not to be a place to 'chill' but a good location to rest head and check out ruins.\n",

Granted, it was the 'cheapest' available, but being called and 'executive room' so we expected something of it. Sadly, it was small and smelt of smoke (we thought it was a 'non smoking hotel'), my partner has asthma and quite frankly we didn't want our belongings to smell of smoke. We popped down to reception, after some checking they said they would be able to move us to another room - although it would be for only one night - and we would have to move again.

We got instead two single beds which, upon request, they moved together and put a queen matress on top of the beds. Also, for some reason, the covers of the two single beds were thrown in a corner of the room and stayed there for the duration of our stay. The other hiccup of our trip was that we thought we had breakfast included and upon going upstairs to the restaurant to have breakfast, we were told breakfast was not included and that we could pay 25EUR each if we wanted to sit down.

Located excellently opposite the Temple of Zeus in central Athens, the views of the Acropolis at breakfast and dinner were simply breathtaking and probably the best thing about the hotel. The nearest metro station (Acropolis) is really close (2 mins walk) and Sintagma is not very far at all. The rooms were clean, tidy and we could have no complaints at all. I would definitely stay here again, simply for the location and views, but the fact the staff are so helpful and welcoming adds to the good rating,\n",

Well what a very pleasant surprise helpful reception staff on arrival, the room on the first floor was of a good size with a huge bed and very clean and comfortable, oh and the towels were fluffy. The room decor had grecian overtones - much nicer than nondescript chain hotel furnishings yes the view from the small window wasn't brilliant overlooking the internal courtyard containing the swimming pool - probably looked better in summer.  A couple points of issue with the room - good TV discreetly placed in a frame on the wall but this probably once held a mirror - only mirror now in bathroom! No…\n",

Opulent decor (maybe over the top?) which was probably more impressive when they were purchased 20 years ago. We were in a wing that may have been an expansion and as we turned the corner, the carpeting changed from a deep royal blue to what looked like a temporary industrial runner complete with baffles to trip over. Sort of felt like the poor cousins. The hotel is feeling a little aged. However, the staff are very friendly and the roof-top breakfast with it's million dollar view is a great way to start a day in Athens.\n",

The entrance feels grand and luxurious with plenty of seating area and a lovely and cosy library.   The room wasn't that great and bad either. No tea or coffee making facilities and the mini-bar price is quite high. No bathrobe provided. A plus for extra pillows   The bathroom is nice in my opinion, but the toiletries are in a good quality.    However, I found most of the staff a bit unfriendly.

Old stuffy pillows, extremely few toiletries in what is rated 5 star. Breakfast ok although could do with more traditional Greek food being one of the reasons for coming to Greece. Hate having to pay extra for what are standard coffees in other hotels such as cappuccino, late or Greek coffee. €6 Euro to iron a shirt outrageous. Most hotels around the world have an iron in the room or ironing room as a basic standard as well as coffee and tea making facilities in the room. Hotel would be much better if it looked after these basics\n",

Aircon doesn't get cool, room paint is tired, small room, not anything like the pics, and the bathroom, wow horrible and so basic. Nowhere to place toiletries, shower is terrible. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel? ? 2 star maybe. So disappointed, foyer is nice and breakfast place has a great view, but the room is just terrible. won't be back and don't stay here.\n",

While not a international 5 star rated hotel, it certainly checks most of the boxes - view from the terrace by the restaurant, view from the Athenian Panorama room where we stayed overlooking the Temple of Olympian Zeus, I'd say it was one of the most romantic views in the city at night. Will be visiting back one day for my anniversary.\n",

They don't have tea making facilities in your room, what! I went upstairs to restaurant and a reading area over looking the beautiful Acropolis but no service there either, as it was between breakfast and lunch. Hard to do without my tea. Service otherwise excellent. I expected to eat  Vine leaves and dips as appertisers or mousaka but these were missing from the service menu.  When in Greek eat Greek food, although the menu would be classified 5 star but no real accent on greek location.  The hotel is also near great restaurants, cross at lights head toward Acropolis, streets and streets of restaurants.…\n",

I have always found the staff polite and helpful and the breakfasts wonderful with a very large choice of good food. The view from the roof top restaurant is panoramic-right across the whole of Athens and was often photographed by visitors. The hotel has several fine bars and a good choice of wines-one being adjacent to the elegant swimming pool. This time we were rewarded by an upgrade to one of top room which was large, clean and a excellent  view of the Olympian Temple of Zeus just across the road. Highly recommended!\n",

With a thin veneer suggesting former gentility, it probably has seen better days, but everything is in working order, clean and inviting. The front desk is efficient, and the staff is multilingual and knowledgeable. The breakfast buffet is divided in half with traditional continental offerings to the right and standard British/American fare to the left. Service is a little disorganized but well-meaning.

Location is very close to the Acropolis and even pretty close to the Monastiraki shops. Panorama room has a great view, though I must say ours was not arranged as the hotel's photos which degraded our view - unless we sat on a bench adjacent to the window. Wasn't pleased by this. Breakfast was included, and while the staff in the restaurant was generally rude, the food was good.  Now the bad - we were in 406 - a Panorama room - and every night around 11pm music began to blare. At first we thought it was from outside, but I soon realized it was from the restaurant on the top floor (7th floor). The music ran well past midnight each night and disrupted our sleep; on the…\n",

One of the hotel's best features is the rooftop restaurant, with views of the Temple of Zeus and Lykabettus Hill on one side and the Acropolis on another.  The breakfast buffet is sumptuous, with a good variety of hot and cold items.  We stayed there before and after our cruise and had a different room each time.  They weren't fancy and didn't overlook the historical sites, but both had comfortable beds, good showers, and a mini-fridge which we used to cool drinks we bought from the convenience store 2 doors down the street.

Dining here was an experience and the food complemented it. Maybe a little pricey but it's worth it for the location. Breakfast is in the same room but on busy days is a bit of a bunfight, and not worthy of this hotel, and the breakfast itself is poor. On our second morning it was quieter as most of the guests were competing in the Athens Marathon and had left early, however the quality of the food didn't improve.

Make sure taxi takes you to hotel entrances, one person unloads and counts the number of bags then the other person pays.\n",

Although we may have been staying in the old wing, the rooms were really tired and small, the air-con was not working, the lights were dim, there was no desk to work from etc.  The pool is really tiny and crowded. The location is good being near the Acropolis Museum but this alone does not justify the prices they are charging for what is barely a 3 star room.\n",

Arrived at the hotel and was impressed with the lobby. Ended up although the room was quite basic it was a very welcome and comfortable reprieve after long hot dats out and about. The breakfast served on the beautiful rooftop terrace overlooking the Acropolis could not be beaten! Beautiful!!!! A lovely clean pool and various comfortable and relaxing sitting areas. Professional and friendly staff and a fantastic position  for a bit of holiday shopping . Highly recommended . Comfortable clean not super modern but perfectly nice. Just wish they would put tea and coffee in the rooms and good hair dryers! Yes I'd book there again for sure.\n",

The hotel is easy to find from the metro and the location is excellent, not in the middle of the hussle and bussle but near to the centre, The rooms were dated, but we did not go to sit in the room all day, we were there to see the sights of Athens which we did. The breakfast for pretty average too but not a disappointment as there was plenty of choice. The roof breakfast buffet and evening bar is just great for fantastic views.\n",

Based on all that, this would have been an \"average rating\".

Great views from the roof top breakfast in the morning which was even more spectacular in the evening at the bar.  My only criticism is that the hotel allows delegates attending a conference to break-out into the pool area during their coffee/lunch break.  This made myself and two other hotel guests very uncomfortable as the delegates sat on pool beds next to guests trying to relax.  Also this is where the delegates break out for a cigarette.\n",

However, we got great deal through one of the websites and had to fork out only £100/night including breakfast. Rooms are quite decent but a few minor issues exist: cleanliness of the carpets in the corridors, wires showing, and bathroom fittings loose. Definitely not a five-star appearance.

      "Review is :I found that all of the staff at the royal olympic were extremely rude, apart from one of the waiters. Even checking in and out took a lot of huffing, tutting and sighing like we were an inconvenience to them.  There were a lot of conferences going on at the hotel whilst we were there which seems to be mainly what the hotel is used for. Whilst you can't fault the cleanliness of the hotel, the cleaners knocking on the door every morning at 8am was extremely frustrating. The room we stayed in (316) was rather tired looking and the bathroom needs a lot of updating too. The breakfast buffet had a good selection of food and you have a beautiful view of the acropolis whilst at the rooftop bar.

      "Review is :We stayed at the Royal Olympic for 5 nights during our visit in August.  It is a beautiful hotel.  We had one of the executive rooms with a small balcony and I would have to say - it was just average. Beds and linen weren't that great, but once again, it could just have been the type of room we were in.  I am sure one of the larger rooms facing the Temple of Zeus is much more spectacular!  The restaurant on the roof serves a great breakfast, but during peak seasons, make sure you get there in time to reserve a table. Dinner is probably very good, although we preferred to have dinner in Plaka. Much better atmosphere.  But DO go up to see the views at night from the roof of the hotel.  This hotel has a PRIME spot!  You can really just walk everywhere, or catch the metro or tram. …\n",

Breakfast was up on the roof, where you coils take in the marvellous views of the Acropolis, fantastic start to any day.  Getting around was easy and most things were easy to walk to, but we used the metro too.  Using the metro to get to and from the airport was easy too, and we purchased a 3 day ticket which we were glad we had done, it came in very useful.\n",

The service is standard, at best. Overall, it doesn't deserve 5 stars - I would give it 3 at best. Admittedly, the hotel was full when we were there, but this led to the ridiculous situation where, when I complained that the internet didn't work in our room, the receptionist replied that it was because the hotel was full, and too many people were online. Surely, a hotel should design its wifi to cater for a full hotel (when its income is greatest), not for a half-full hotel and let the guests down whenever its well-booked. We arrived in the late evening and were given what seemed to be the last room…\n",

The view from the breakfast terrace is awesome, you can watch the sun rising on the parthenon. The common areas (Lobby, business rooms and pool are very nice. The service is perfect. On the other hand, the rooms are small and the hotel is expensive. If you are smoker, you can ask for a small terrace in your room.  If you are in a business trip, working in your room is quite difficult, although wifi is free, the desk in you room is very small and the chair is uncomfortable.

The check in was fairly straight forward with assistance offered. Staff were friendly and helpful.  The room size was OK and the cleanliness was very good. As you would expect the mini bar was ridiculously expensive, why would you pay 9 euros for a spirit or 5 euros for water when the supermarket next door sells water for 50 cents.  Breakfast was very good, with an excellent choice. The rooftop restaurant offers an excellent view.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Acropolis which is a must visit. Didn't try the bar or restaurant so I can't comment on those.  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the stay in the hotel.\n",

Changed lines once for 1 stop got off at the Acropolis and ended up only a couple of blocks from the hotel. Good fun. Hotel itself is beautiful inside. Classy lobby, courteous staff and very nice lower bar - courtyard - pool area with poolside bar service. Our room was a free upgrade to a junior suite that was truly magnificent. Hotel is an easy walk to the hop on - hop off tour route and the Plaka - local tourist shops. The roof top garden restaurant view is spectacular and worth at least one dinner reservation and the buffet breakfast is beyond normal expectations. Taxi back to airport was €40.\n",

For less than 24 hours in Athens this was perfect.    The rooms looked like they were straight out of the 70's- the nightstand even had a built in radio!  The rooms were tiny, dated, and shabby and I didnt really want to touch anything in the bathroom which only had a bathtub and no shower.

Minuses were an old fashioned small elevator, the crowds (seems like a popular hotel for conferences), the noise that carried from the neighbor's balcony and bathroom, and the less than friendly staff.

Agree with other reviews about the restaurant on the roof top. Over priced and the food is very average. Our waiter was very rude. Would not supply a torch as you can not read the menu. Ordered a drink for myself and my husband. Mine never came. Then he tried to charge us for it. Loved staying here for the location and the view. Would never use restaurant again.\n",

Just a 2-3 minute walk to the plaka with plenty of restaurants, shopping and points of interest.  Enjoy a night cap on the roof top terrace with the acropolis straight ahead and the temple of Zeus to the right.  An enchanting view that is enjoyed again at breakfast which was delicious as well. Staff were very professional and helpful and the king size bed very comfortable.\n",

Gym facilities were limited and in another building, so the walk back to the hotel was a freezing cold 200 yard dash around the corner.  Superb view of the Acropolis from the rooftop garden or inside from the restaurant.  Athens is steeped in history but the graffiti daubed over nearly every building is saddening to see.\n",

      "Review is :First hotel we stayed at after landing in the airport. This hotel is listed as one of the few 'luxury hotels' around the tourist Athens area. While it is not a 5 star hotel (as its listed), it is certainly one of the better ones around.   Due to local laws, the buildings in Athens cannot be taller and obstruct views of the Acropolis and therefore none of the hotels are that majestic.  Then lobby is certainly impressive, the concierge very helpful. The gym is located offsite in a dark room, but serviceable as well.   I was initially taken back about how small the elevator was and the mechanisms, but this seems to be a constant theme of the hotels in Europe. The rooms are small and the bed dominates most of the place. The bathrooms are mediocre as well and the whole room just…\n",

Check-in and out at the reception was average to say the least. No welcome, no introduction, no guidance, just key card and go find attitude. The deluxe room was in need of upgrading, not traditional but just 'worn out' ! It took over 10 minutes to figure out how the shower worked.

The hotel itself has a lovely pool. Our first stay saw us with a tiny room with inadequate wardrobe space in that it wasn't worth opening my suitcase for. The second stay of 4 days saw us upgraded to a larger room which was infinitely better. I found the wait staff to be pleasant but not as attentive or prompt in their service. They could benefit from learning about service from the Americans and I am sure their tips would go up accordingly. This is a very centrally located hotel enabling easy access to public transport and The Plaka. I would strongly recommend this hotel.\n",

The pool was freezing which cooled us off nicely. Rooms were decent size but nothing special but we didn't spend any time there anyway except to sleep. Breakfast was good, although a little crowded at 0930. Staff all v helpful especially when we found someone else had charged their bar bill to our room!

However, the reception staff I found really helpful and the location was superb.  The pool was the reason for choosing the hotel and it was tired, badly managed (overrun with children on one particular day) but towels are provided there and if you are lucky you will get a sun lounger.

Breakfast was excellent for the range and quality of the food, as well as the views from the restaurant of the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus. Something should be done about the location of the coffee though as at certain times there were queues which obstructed the buffet.

My taxi picked me up at 5:45 a.m. and the previous evening, while checking in, I asked for a cup of coffee in the morning, instead of breakfast, prior to my check off. I was told the policy of this five star hotel is to provide a cup of coffee at early check out only for the rate of room service.

Only 1 seat to sit in the room and so my daughter or I had to sit on the bed. Executive rooms on website show a pool view with French doors out, I could not see how any of the executive rooms had this as the only French doors to the pool were from the bar area. Saying this I would stay here…\n",

The hotel is literally across TEMPLE of Olympian Zeus with Athens Gate also nearby but i would say this hotel is a better choice.we stayed for two nights and went to mykonos and santorini then while coming back we checked in at 12 am as our cruise came in at 11:30 pm at the port and the place is 20 minutes away( TIP : go well in advance near the exit of the ferry or cruise while getting down on the port in Greece to avoid getting super late because of traffic, no cabs or unable to locate your signboard.)

Somehow they manage to make this an oasis of quiet and calm in the midst of a bustling city scene.  The swimming pool is bottomless and well placed.  After a long day of touring, we always looked forward to returning \"home'.    Great for families or business.  Decent wi-fi and most speak english.  Spacious rooms with large marble floored lobbies.    Our family loved this and so will yours.  The price was far less than expected and we could easily have expected to pay much more.\n",

They also were decorated very tastefully, as was the lobby. Breakfast was fantastic. However, the front desk staff was rude and not particularly helpful.

Having said that though, the food and breakfast is great.

We dined underneath the stars in the hotel's idyllic rooftop restaurant in the shadow of the Acropolis. The perfect setting for one of the most disappointing meals we've ever had. The food was cold and distinctly average and the service was appalling (it took the waiters three hours to serve two courses). If we thought dinner was bad there was much worse to come next day at breakfast time.  Again, the food was cold and tasteless, the service was non-existent.....and the crockery was chipped!. In a five-star hotel? Not good enough. It's a great shame because the public areas are gorgeous. A Greek tragedy if ever there was one.\n",

In our particular case it was worth it as we got a balcony room on the 6th floor overlooking the Temple of Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch and, off to the left, a good view of the Acropolis and Parthenon.  We got to the hotel early in the day (~10AM) and our room wasn’t ready.  We did not get the same quality room when we returned to Athens the night before our flight out.  I’m sure there are a number of lucky breaks that land you a room like that but the rest of the hotel was pretty nice and the location was pretty good as well.  Our first room was huge with glass windows looking out over the scenery.  We probably had at least40 sq ft of balcony and the view was outstanding at night, with all the ruins lit up.

The tub did had a separate hand held faucet but we're used to showers.  Also there were no cups on the sink area.  Finally the hair dryer was mounted on the wall in the area where the toilet was.  It didn't reach over to where the mirror was so drying your hair was a little awkward.  Overall a very nice and comfortable room with a great view.

There was no power point to connect either hairdryer, electric toothbrush or shaver. No face towels. Existing towels in need of replacement. The lighting in the room is poor. Again, power points are far and few between. I would have expected a 5 Star hotel to turn the beds down at night! When checking out, the staff didn't have the courtesy to thank for visiting or acknowledge our stay! Against that, the Porter was nice and helpful.

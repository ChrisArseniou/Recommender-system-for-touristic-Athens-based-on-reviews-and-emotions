Breakfast good. Most sights are within walking distance if you are happy to walk. The metro is a 5 min walk from hotel & easy and cheap to use. Do be aware pick pockets, but that goes fo r any city. The hop on hop off bus has a stop from the hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend or stay at this hotel again\n",

      "Review is :Many travel blogs say “stay somewhere off the beaten path” but I could not disagree more! If you have limited time in Athens and want a reasonably priced hotel close to EVERYTHING, you should stay at Plaka Hotel. We arrived late on Thursday night (10:00 PM) and the staff was super welcoming and helpful. We checked in quickly and went up to the roof for drinks and a light dinner (it is open until 12:00 AM). The view of the Parthenon is spectacular and we had the whole roof to ourselves! The room was very comfortable and our balcony was a nice surprise. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and exactly what we needed. Every single site in Athens is within a 12 minute walk. We did not spend a penny on transportation. The staff also provided extra blankets and fixed a light in the bathroom minutes after we notified them. They held our luggage after check-out while we wandered around Plaka and did some shopping. I will definitely return to Plaka Hotel when I return to Athens.…\n",

Literally everything you need is on your doorstep.  I am so glad we stayed here. We went to Syntagma square which is known as the heart but it's too busy and too spaced out, whereas Monastiraki is the gateway to the ancient sites, lots of high street shops, small tourist shops, and tavernas/bars. Rooms are fab, very clean & comfortable. The star attraction though has to be the rooftop bar with an amazing view of the acropolis which is lit on a night. We had breakfast, which was not that great, but ok to start the day. Staff were lovely and friendly and happy to help at reception with any queries. Can't wait to go back!…\n",

The breakfast is fresh and plentiful and what you would expect in a 3 star hotel. The location is amazing with close proximity to all sites, restaurants, cafes. The rooftop bar and cafe has great views of the Acropolis, reserve a table in advance to get the best views. Would recommend!\n",

      "Review is :I am so glad I chose this hotel for my first night ever in Athens.  The receptionists were extremely helpful, friendly and polite and the hotel itself was easy to find. I walked from the KTEL station in Athens after travelling from Kalamata, which took around 40 minutes (by choice). The hotel is bang in the centre of the main touristy district of Plaka.   The flea market and Monastiraki square are about two minutes away on foot. Areopagus Hill (well worth visiting) is about a seven minute walk, and the Acropolis, Parthenon etc are all within walking distance too.   The room itself had a spectacular view of the Acropolis and, especially at night, the window looked like a hung piece of art! The bed was comfortable and the air-conditioning was great. The shower was spacious with…\n",

      "Review is :I booked this hotel as my last night in Athens and immediately regretted it. I should have stayed here for my entire stay. My room was overlooking the Parthenon and that absolutely warmed my heart. The rooftop bar was an amazing place to relax, watch the sunset. The breakfast was extensive as I could see but since I had to leave for the airport very early, I could just enjoy a cup of coffee.   Downside - my room was on the top floor just under the rooftop bar. The chairs were making so much noise that I couldn't sleep. I had to go down to the reception and ask if a solution could be found as the whole idea of booking this hotel was to get some sleep. This is not something they could sort out immediately but perhaps could look into it for the future.\n",

I was only here for 2 nights to explore and do the things I wanted to do, and I knew what I was signing up for when I booked this hotel. It has a free breakfast, although I woke up late and missed it. I didn't expect much so I wasn't disappointed. You can't beat the location and the view from the rooftop. It's in the middle of everything tourisy. Overall, I'm satisfied with it, and would recommend this place.\n",

The room was clean and updated and the included buffet breakfast was generous with many choices. The clientele was wonderfully cosmopolitan.  We really appreciated the hip rooftop bar & restaurant with lovely views of the Acropolis (& the city) on a balmy summer evening upon our arrival when we were too tired to venture out.  The friendly service we received as also excellent and the hotel helpfully arranged to a private taxi to take us to/from an out-of-town event, which was a great relief. Highly recommend Hotel Plaka and would definitely stay here again upon return to Athens.\n",

Our room (508) was a Superior Double Room which was a good size with plenty of space for storage.  The bathroom was quite big with all the facilities that you need.  There were a couple of things we didn't like about the room.  The walls were painted a dark green and the low lighting was unable to dispel the gloomy atmosphere.

There is also a small fridge if you need it. Lots of power sockets, including one each side of the bed. Mirror is on the inside of the wardrobe door.

Check in was excellent- such a warm and friendly lady who always greeted us with a smile ( even under the face mask you could tell she was smiling ) Our room was first floor but after reading reviews about the noise we asked if we could go higher. And the highest they had was floor 2. Gotta say that I know it’s out of season but we had no disruption from the noise.  Room was very clean and big enough for 2. It was cold when we was there and the room was lovely and warm.  Fridge was faulty - although we did not asked to have fixed while we were there as was not needed.  Breakfast had a very good choice.

A much smaller room , smaller bathroom and even smaller shower (502) but ok. The noise above us was still SO noisy that even with our white noise machine we were woken at 530am in the mornings with noise, every morning.  Very unfortunate.  Called front desk reluctantly to ask...WHY and were told this type of complaint has NEVER happened before and well....that was that.

Close enough to great shopping and restaurants nearby, but the hotel feels far enough away that you can get some quiet sleep.   The staff was wonderful - from the front desk personnel, to the woman supervising the breakfast buffet, to housekeeping, to the bar staff upstairs on the rooftop. They were all very friendly and warm, and helped us out in perfect English. The front desk helped arrange a terrific driver for us to the airport at the end of our stay.

We took the metro directly from the airport to Monastiraki SQ and it was a 5 min walk from there to the hotel.   The rooms are furnished and the bathroom (albeit a little small) have amenities. There are sanitizing stations everywhere. Mask is worn by the staff and they expect the guests as well to wear them in closed public areas of the hotel.

You’re very close to the Acropolis, which was only about a 15-20 minute walk. The best amenity is the rooftop of the hotel. It is open 24 hours so if you need to kill some time before dinner you can head outside to see an amazing view of the Acropolis. The bar on the rooftop opens up at 18:00 and I highly recommend this too. The Acropolis is lit up at night and it’s an unreal view from the rooftop. The staff is also extremely friendly and accommodating. The free breakfast is also a huge plus. For the price of the hotel, you get tons of value.\n",

I dont know..) But overall, nice smiley people,  clean, comftable room. Not need more.  Paid 90€ for BB looks like a fare price for this location and view.  Do not try to come here with a rental car.

Of course the normal buffet breakfast wasn’t available, instead it’s necessary to order what you want and this is then delivered to your table by friendly staff.  The hot food (scrambled eggs and bacon) to be very cold. I’m sure if I complained this would have rectified but I didn’t bother, the staff were quiet busy.

I wanted to give them a chance after having stayed there in 2019 with a power outage (still they made me pay full price) but this year the room was NOT a superior room, there were 2 Aircon vents on my minuscule balcony and the sheets were unclean. The rooftop bar does not exist anymore (bare walls and cables) and the least management could have done is to be upfront about it. Avoid at all costs!!!\n",

Breakfast was tasty with nice options but quite crowded if you are eating at a popular time. Finding seats was occasionally difficult. When we had an early tour and ate as soon as breakfast opened we had much better seating options and nothing was unavailable in terms of beverages in the coffee machine, etc.   The hotel is located with a beautiful view of the Acropolis, and it was an easy walk to many Plaka attractions and walking tour meeting points.\n",

About 5-10 minutes walk in the opposte direction from the Hotel bring you to the Monastiraki Square, flea market and and the remains of Hadrian's Library.

The rooftop is under construction, but still had plenty of space and outdoor couches for guests to sit and admire the acropolis. It was chilly but so peaceful and relaxing to sit and enjoy the view.

The reception is small but the rest of the hotel is deceptively spacious. There is a small lift up to the breakfast area on the first floor. Our room was a few floors up. The view from our room was of the side street. The room was fairly large and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay, including safe, fridge and plenty of storage space.

      "Review is :It started badly and only got worse.  The manager demanded to see proof of my reservation and room confirmation, and all but called me a liar.  Once proof was produced there was no apology forthcoming.  The lift was not working and we had to use the service lift that barely fitted two of us.  The room was drab, smelly and small, the bathroom smaller, no room for an electric outlet. The power went out, our access cards didnt work and no one at reception to answer the phone. this meant walking up and down 7 flights of stairs..The rooftop furniture has seen better days and the view although nice, could be seen from many other vantage points. The breakfast was average. The location was good.  I would not recommend this hotel.\n",

View from rooftop, of city and Acropolis, is wonderful, day and night. Rooftop bar open until 11:30pm. Breakfast starts at 7am, allowing for early start of the day, and there is a huge array of food and drink. Rooms are clean and bathroom is nice, especially the shower. Great place to stay.\n",

Upgraded to a room with a view of the Acropolis however the windows were really dirty and the bathroom shower door broken. The bathroom itself was very dated and not very clean - not good enough for €200 a night. We were also woken by the cleaners at 7am which wasn’t ideal  I would stay here again simply for the location but the upgrade simply not worth it - view from the rooftop will tick that box\n",

Plaka is one of the best neighborhoods (so we were told) and was good and central for us to wander.  Aside from that, the hotel itself was just odd.  Maybe we got a strange room but some things to note.  First, the hotel has one elevator that holds 2 adults with luggage at best.  We took the stairs mainly but felt bad for the older guests trying to get their luggage and themselves for that matter to their rooms, there is no \"bellhop\".  The room, updated and clean however rather small.  The room door itself didn't close easily so had to kind of slam the door closed to ensure it was closed when we left. The bathroom shower…\n",

The room was well taken care of but the front desk area felt like a rundown inn or hostel; could use some work.  Unfortunately the front desk (apart from the young lady) was extremely rude. The older gentleman who checked us out seemed to accuse us of not being able to pay (our original credit card used for pre-booking was stolen a month prior to check-in which forced the account number to change, this was explained to the staff via e-mail the weeks prior; he seemed unaware or still skeptical).

The rooftop has a view of the Acropolis that is fantastic!  Beware that there are thieves in the area that seem to be watching the hotel lobby.

Rooms are clean but a tad small (quite common).  Initially the room was configured with two single beds. By night 3 we requested they make the beds up as a queen - which was done without fuss - just wish we’d spoken up sooner. The bathroom was also small with a small shower - the shower was hot and strong - but if you had it on full you would flood the whole bathroom very quickly. The water drains very slowly and the placement of the drains means that your bathroom floor will definitely get wet.\n",

You are within a 20 minute or less walk from many of the major attractions. You also have the option of many trip advisor highly rated eating spots spread within a 15 minute walk, so you won't run out of delicious reasonable options. There is an AB market adjacent to the hotel and the flea market with anything and everything you are looking for. The rooms were exactly what you need; ample room space, clean and air conditioned, and a modern (albeit a bit small) bathroom.

About a 30-35 min cab from the airport (38€ flat fee unless between 12am-5am; then more) or 60 min metro ride. If you’re taking a cab I highly recommend you download the Beat app since there is no Uber in Greece- it’s like Uber but for cabs, and you can pay on the app like Uber.   Shopping, tons of restaurants, about 20 min walk to acropolis. This is a notorious pickpocket area though so watch your bag.  The hotel has an elevator, and the rooms are spacious, quiet, and clean. They have an amazing bar area with food out from 1am-5am (before breakfast) for the night owls or those leaving super early to the airport. 24/7 coffee and water available too.…\n",

We walked to Acropolis and it’s museum 3 times only 15 minutes away. We found staff so helpful. Washing was done in a day for a reasonable cost. Views from some rooms fabulous. Our room, 601 was at bottom of stairs from rooftop bar. It was noisy late. Our shower was small for older travellers. Bathroom bench was roomy. Both our friends had large showers with sliding screens. We had breakfast included and this area could be used for tea and coffee during the day. Wifi was good. Stronger after lunch. Hotel is about 20 min to 45 min from airport depending on times. We caught train on arrival and taxi departing.…\n",

It’s close to the metro station as well as several attractions   They also provided local sweets and wine in our room that we thought was a nice touch.

The hotel itself is pretty typical of a larger hotel anywhere in the world. I don’t know that I would worry too much about paying for the Acropolis View again. The best view of the Acropolis is definitely from the roof top bar. It is a very average bar but it does have a spectacular view of the Acropolis and other parts of Athens. The rooms are of average size and comfortable enough. The hotel has 6 floors and does have a lift, albeit a slow one. Internet was pretty slow but worked. The staff on reception were friendly, the person (1) in the bar was well, there. Breakfast was pretty good but once again what I call international, I’ve had the same breakfast in…\n",

I stayed for one night in an Economy Room in July (see pics). The room reminded me of a university dorm room; a small room with a double bed against the wall, utilitarian furniture, laminate flooring, and bare walls. The bathroom was small but functional with a shower only. The AC is a wall unit that worked very well and was relatively quiet. There was a small safe that is operated by your hotel key card. There is also a good quality hairdryer, TV, wifi and mini fridge. The bed was a double and sagged in the middle.

The hotel has a nice breakfast and very friendly front desk, and it's located right in the \"Plaka\", a huge shopping and restaurant district near the main center of Athens.  My room was very nicely set up, and the hotel even provides a GPS locator for your convenience so you can shop the internecine byways of the Plaka and  yet return to the hotel with minimal hassles.  Strongly recommend. Indeed, I plan to be in Athens again in late September and to my surprise? I found the hotel was fully booked for my proposed five-day stay.

Rooftop bar is nothing fancy, but reasonably priced and friendly.

Big pieces of feta, pastries, eggs, fresh honey, and real Greek yogurt. Above else, the management takes great care of the guests.

Fortunately that did not affect our checkout, but it could be an issue with groups of people. I'd recommend this hotel.\n",

Comfortable, modern rooms, which were very clean and well appointed. Great breakfast, good selection, pleasant room and good service. The rooftop and bar with Acropolis views was amazing. The staff is very efficient and good. We found some to be more welcoming and helpful than others,  I would stay again and encourage others to do so.  We left our windows open the first night.

But the Plaka Hotel managed to distinguish itself even so.  We arrived around 11 pm after a very long day of flying.  We were shown our compact but clean and very serviceable room.  We went down to inquire about where we might get a bite to eat.  The front desk clerk helpfully directed us to a pedestrian friendly plaza only a couple of blocks away.  We were surprised to see so many people out, enjoying the cafes, etc.  Around one corner, we caught a glimpse of the Acropolis hill all lit up—a remarkable sight.  We found an informal place where we got some take out tasty skewers of meat and grilled vegetables that we enjoyed in our room.  A great…\n",

There is a rooftop bar and seating to enjoy magnificent views of the acropolis.  The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable.  The only demerit was sound in the halls and adjoining rooms.  Although this seems pretty common for mid-priced European.  The best part of the hotel was the breakfast buffet.  It was by far the best breakfast buffet we have had in all of our European travels.\n",

You could not be closer to everything! Was so nice to be able to pop back to the hotel during the day for a break or to drop items off and know you weren't having to do a big detour to do so.

The best services provided by the Hotel which really stands out are  : - all rooms come with free handphone and free charges for you to carry and use google maps to explore the city without getting lost. I find it very useful because you can easily lost your way when you wonder in many small alleys and pathways. - cool food and drink are available at all times.

Check-in was friendly, quick and efficient, something we really appreciated after a 24 hour travel day. Since we booked on Expedia, we got a complimentary bottle of wine and plate of pastries with our room, another nice touch.  We booked an Acropolis-view room and weren’t disappointed. Sure, we had to pay a slight premium and the room was smaller than most in the hotel, but it was worth it, the view from our room was amazing.

On previous occasions I've stayed at the sister hotel, the Hermes, and made use of the Plaka's wonderful terrace for an evening drink.  I couldn't get a room in the Hermes and so opted for the Plaka.  Although more expensive it was well worth it.  A few minutes' walk to Monastiraki Square gives an idea of how central the location is.  My traveling companions and I were able to walk to all the major places of interest even though we are in our late 60s.  My single room was adequate for a single occupant with just enough space for all my stuff.  The bathroom was a good size and the shower was spacious with hot water at high pressure.

      "Review is :Plaka Hotel is a fun property.  It is vintage but has been updated.  The staff was very attentive.  The elevator is tiny but much appreciated.  We stayed on the top floor.  Some rooms have views of the Acropolis.  If one doesn't get an Acropolis view there is the rooftop terrace.  Watching the sunset from the rooftop terrace with the view of the Acropolis is amazing.  The blankets were a nice addition as the fall evening was chilly.  Plaka Hotel is walking distance to most of the major attractions. There was a full breakfast buffet as well as restaurants on every street nearby.  The front desk staff were very helpful.  The side streets around the hotel are filled with little shops.  They were fun to explore.  The botanical garden is nearby too.  It was very nice to be able to…\n",

Our room was comfortable and quite generously sized for European standards. The view of the acropolis from our room was also great, can't get much closer and awe inspiring than that. We got our room at a rate less than $100CAD a night which is a steal for what it offered, I would definitely stay here again.\n",

Buffet breakfast was very satisfactory and receptionist staff ver very helpful. The hotel offers free hot drinks throughout the day and they kept our luggage for A couple of day while we flew to the islands. Unfortunately there was no restaurant for dinner.\n",

Right down the street '' Kitpo.\"  Just relaxing, outdoor, peaceful and good, reasonable food.  Our hotel room was very comfortable -- we only heard one group come in quite late and they were not making an effort to be quiet, so won't blame the hotel.  We loved breakfast and the gal, Eva, who wandered around helping guests with their day plans -- really a wonderful service.  She also managed to hook us up with other guests who were heading to the same cruise we were getting on -- we shared a hired driver to Piraeus because the taxis were on strike.

It is a smallish, older hotel (with miniature lift) but well-maintained, and the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful (as well as impressively multilingual). As other reviewers have mentioned, it's location is fantastic - walking distance to all the major sights of Athens, as well as to Syntagma Square railway station & airport bus stop. We splurged on an 'Acropolis View' room and it was worth it to see the amazing sight of the Parthenon lit up at night through our window. The room was a reasonable size, clean and very comfortable. The roof terrace is a great spot to enjoy a wine or ouzo while soaking up that view. Breakfast was plentiful…\n",

There are a few metro stops within a ten minute walk to get you on a variety of lines. All the Athens sights are within a comfortable walking distance.  Breakfast was okay.

      "Review is :This was an above average hotel especially lauded for its location in the center of bustling Plaka. Nearby was a pedestrian mall with numerous shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants. Inside the hotel was a beautiful roof deck bar with astounding views of the Acropolis that can’t be missed. The hotel staff during the day was mostly very friendly and helpful especially the female workers. Breakfast, included in the daily rate, provided for a good start to your day consisting of eggs, breakfast meats, fruit, Greek yogurt, cereals, fresh fruit, and other Greek delicacies and pastries. Coffee and cookies were left out self service until the evening.  Rooms were clean and serviceable albeit a bit on the smaller side. Typical European double beds which is two twin beds side by side.…\n",

Rooms were of good size and they gave us an adjoining room with our friends. Helpful staff. Breakfast was well appointed and enough food to last us till a late lunch. The 24 hour espresso/coffee machine was used daily and served with cookies and cucumber water. All self served.   Every night we gathered with a nice glass of wine on the rooftop deck, which was incredible!!! Location and views can not be beat!!!!!\n",

And the manager graciously invited us to enjoy a yummy breakfast when we arrived early on our check in day. The room was quiet and spacious, even after they provided an extra bed for our third family member. The only inconvenience is the tiny elevator that gets very busy during check in and out times. After it stopped on our floor completely full for the third time the day we checked out, we finally schlepped our heavy bags down the stairs. But that was a minor complaint. Would definitely…\n",

A room upgrade with an Acropolis view more than compensated for our lost time as we were flying out the next day. Thank you Vasillis for your welcome . We dined close by, bought last minute souvenirs and went to the roof top bar to view the Parthenon under lights. Unfortunately it was extremely windy and the full moon was not visible but such an amazing spot regardless. We left the curtains open through the night to further enjoy the view. The wifi was strong and the included breakfast was plentiful and varied. This is definitely another place to revisit.\n",

When we first booked it, we thought that the hotel would be just OK but it greatly exceeded our expectations. The hotel is not modern by any stretch of the imagination BUT it is a solid, clean hotel with good size rooms, comfortable beds, good size bathroom, great buffet breakfast and because there is a small entrance way as you enter your room, there is some distance that provides a buffer between the hallway and the room.

      "Review is :Plaka hotel is an overated and a tired hotel.  Rooms are tiny and furniture needs to be rearranged to be able to place suitcases or manouevre around.  Showers do not drain, and a stagnate smell from unwashed bed covers fills the room (bed sheets were clean though). Maintenance has been lacking with hand basins cracked, tapware well worn, skirting boards lifting off walls. There does not appear to have any interest in any upkeep of the premises.    Staff were only interested in doing the minimum anything else was bothersome.  The hotel asks its guests to write favourable reviews on tripadvisor, but really aside from the great view of the acropolis on the roof, there is nothing much going for this hotel.    Strongly advise to research alternate accommodation as the price did not…\n",

The roof top views of the Acropolis are phenomenal, the location is 1/2 blocks to Plaka shopping, only blocks from Monasteriki, Ermou street,  other locations, and metro. There is a mini market next door, elevator for luggage, quiet, clean and tidy. They let me borrow an electric plug, and helped me with directions. The particular room I had, had a small shower, it was tight. If you are a big person, you should ask about shower space in Greece hotels, they tend to be wet rooms vs full bathrooms.

Only two nights here. Definitely would have liked to stay longer. Did not have much time to fully enjoy walking around the Plaka District. The room itself was standard. Slept comfortably. Good strong A/C. Breakfast had a large selection of items. In a nutshell we were pleased with the accomodations and especially enjoyed the rooftop view and location of this hotel!

Room was clean and bathroom fairly large for such an old building.  Walls were paper thin - so if you’re looking for privacy this probably is not a fit.  Delicious FREE breakfast in the morning too.

      "Review is :This was the third time we have stayed at this hotel. It is in a great location for shopping, exploring and general sightseeing. There are a multitude of restaurants nearby with a range of choices in terms of quality. The rooms are not 5 star but they are very comfortable and clean. The lift is painful as it is very small and can take ages to come to the foyer from the upper floors. The staff in all areas are always very helpful. Be mindful if you go upstairs to the bar at night that prices are exorbitant. We had 1 small bottle of water, 1 beer and 4 glasses of wine and the lady charged us 37 euro. Compared to the median level pricing for the rooms this is over the top. Either the lady made a mistake or you need to review your prices. One thing I would suggest is to get rid of…\n",

This room was small and was two single beds pushed together. The shower was also very small. On our way back from the islands, we stayed an additional night and this room was better in that there was a full shower tub, but again, beds pushed together. The beds also weren’t that comfortable. Would recommend this place if you are just looking for a nice location and clean room, but don’t expect the best nights sleep.\n",

This is a delight, eating under the stars with a group of traditional musicians playing Greek songs. Do go up to the rooftop bar and see the view of the Acropolis, it is amazing. Make sure you go at sunset to see the Acropolis light up. This must be the best view in Athens. The room was good and very clean. The beds were great. We had a view of the Acropolis from our window (costs extra) and had the wonder of going to sleep looking at it and waking up with it. On the negative side, there are a lot of stairs.

There is a rooftop bar which is open in the evenings and you can sit and look at the amazing view of the acropolis as the sun goes down and Elsa is there in attendance and looks after you so well.

Honestly, we spent little time in the actual room since we were exploring basically all days, but it was a great place to put your head down after some busy days. WiFi was excellent. The breakfast was the best out of all the hotels we stayed in, and the rooftop lounge with view of the Acropolis can't be beat. The location is fantastic, with the Acropolis being about 15 minutes away and a metro station about 8 minutes away walking. We didn't interact with the front desk staff that much; check-in/out was smooth and efficient.\n",

The streets nearby carry little traffic and there are many lovely squares filled with trees and cafe tables.  Monastiraki metro station is 3 minutes walk away, Syngtagma Square is about 6 minutes and the Acropolis about 20 mins.  The view from the rooftop terrace is great, especially around dusk, and drinks on the rooftop bar are quite reasonably priced. Breakfast is good, with plenty of choice.  All the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. The problem is the bedrooms.  The lift up is small and was occasionally not working.  Our bedroom was tiny, with a small double bed.

First and the foremost is the proximity to all the tourist attractions of athens, we walked to all places and we had a 5 year old kid with us. Their front desk was ready to help for anything round the clock , I had several queries being a tourist and they were happy to help us. Rooms were spacious and they cleaned it every day. Only point of concern, although not a major one was their breakfast spread, It was the same every day for 5 days we stayed.Will recommend any tourist whose sole aim is to be in the heart of everything touristy of athens to stay here.\n",

A major shopping mall is one block away. We stayed at this hotel on three occasions during our visit to Greece. On the first occasion we were upgraded to a spacious room containing a bath and a balcony which overlooked the main street. On the second and third occasions our rooms were much smaller (no bath but a shower). The beds and pillows were very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water.

Helped with our laundry enquirers) and also checked on us during breakfast to see how they could help.

Prices are quite high so I recommend monitoring online offers. I love the fabric store that's right on the corner with Mitropoleus. I recommend it for the location although in the city you can find more reasonable prices hotels, perhaps not positioned as well.\n",

Fantastic location enabling everything within walking distance just outside the hotel - restaurants, cafes, shopping, public transport and tourist attractions. We walked to the Acropolis from the hotel - admitly with a map and some instructions for directions! The breakfast was okay, a lot of things were empty and were a little slow to refill, but a nice range. Plenty of sweet options (pastries etc).  The roof top bar is perfect for a drink as the sun sets and you have one of the best views to the Acropolis. Whilst this isn't a 5 star hotel, this roof top would place it far higher than similar hotels in its price range.

The location is absolutely perfect for everything in Athens you are right in the centre of most of the major sites and you can walk to all of them within minutes. Some of my favourite restaurants and cafes are also within a short stumble away so even when your feet hurt from walking around so much you don’t have to go far for some coffee.   The room we had was perfect my only criticism is the hairdryer doesn’t pack much punch. We were on the sixth floor which was amazing having such a great view and really being in the centre of so much activity. There was a gentleman playing the accordion not far from the hotel which we could hear until quite late but I quite enjoyed it.   I would recommend going to breakfast quite early before the rush…\n",

The breakfast was much more than expected,with a great choice of food and drinks. We had a room on the 5th floor, the only sound I heard was my Husbands snoring, The view from the terrace bar was outstanding. Athens is a BEAUTIFUL CITY my only disappointment was with the amount of graffiti around the place, even churches and historic buildings were covered in it !! Such a shame. All in all a fabulous time spent in Athens and would definitely recommend the Plaka hotel\n",

I asked for a high floor due to potential traffic noose and the hotel put us both on the 6th floor (top floor) and we both had an acropolis view to die for.

I do it because I truly believe that the Hotel Plaka offers the BEST LOCATION, the BEST VALUE for a major European city hotel, and \"Φιλότιμο\", loosely translated in this review to mean the INCREDIBLE WELCOME & HOSPITALITY that one receives. I've been traveling to Greece for 44 years and I've stayed in rooms offered at the ferry boat docks, five star luxury hotels, and everything in between. Yes, newer hotels may come and go.....but none of them have changed my opinion.

All the employees  were very welcoming & helpful. Some examples of being helpful were suggesting itineraries and arranging taxis at specific times.   This was particularly useful on our final day. We checked out at noon, but did not have a flight till the evening. many times this can prove to be a problem. Not at the hotel Plaka. There is a dedicated storage room next to reception where we left our luggage whilst we continued our exploration of Athens. Free coffee & biscuits were also available in the restaurant even after checkout. So our final afternoon was a pleasure.\n",

Location is excellent -- an easy walk to the Acropolis and the main sights of classical Athens, a few blocks from the Monastakiri Subway stop (where two of the three subway lines in Athens cross, including the one that goes to the airport.  The Plaka District is bustling with restaurants and shopping. We had dinner at different restaurants every night within five minutes of the hotel.

The hotel room (503) was quite small but comfortable, the bed especially was very comfortable but the room could have done with some tea and coffee facilities as this is only available in the breakfast room up until 5pm.  The bathroom again small and comfortable and the shower was the best of any hotel, nice and powerful and no changing of temperature you normally get.  All hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.

The hotel room is a decent size and provides for all the basics but is not luxurious. It was clean and functional and the bed comfortable.

The room is considerably smaller than the one our friends got, but the view was worth it. Wifi was good enough for normal casual use. The bed had seen better days, but didn't impact my experience.  Included buffet was good, with a solid spread of eggs, bacon or sausage, cold cutsand cheese, various breads, pastries, olives, greek salad, desserts, etc.  It is also nice that the breakfast room is available to hang out and grab coffee/tea/water and a biscuit.\n",

The location and views from this small hotel are outstanding. As you will read in numerous other reviews, the staff at the Plaka Hotel are excellent. This strong emphasis on service is what makes up for the, arguably, little inconveniences: Small lift - this wasn't any trouble for us. In fact squeezing the two of us and our luggage in was kind of fun. You are in an older building and this is the norm. If this is enough to \"ruin\" your stay, take the stairs (great exercise) or stay somewhere else. Small bathrooms - yes, they're small, but functional. You won't fit two people in them comfortably. The renovations have gone a long way to tidying them up and, yes,…\n",

      "Review is :This hotel is in a great location, that was the big selling point for us when booking. It’s reasonably priced and the rooms are clean and comfortable. We did have a slight issue with the shower head; you had to have the water pressure at a certain level as otherwise the head would spray up towards the ceiling. It wasn’t enough to warrant a complaint though. If you have trouble sleeping, this may not be the hotel for you. We could hear people above us quite often, I would request to be on the top floor if possible. Only had breakfast once, was ok but not much of a breakfast person. The staff are friendly and helpful when you approach them. They don’t make small talk or anything but not everyone wants that anyway. The rooftop bar is nice, relaxing after a long day.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed here for a couple of nights when we first arrived in Athens. Staff are lovely and helpful, and breakfast was reasonably good. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there are dozens of tourist trap restaurants nearby. Frankly Greek cuisine will disappoint after France and Italy. The location is very good but we soon tired of all the tourist shops all selling the same thing. But this is a review of the hotel and we loved it. The view from the rooftop bar of the city and Acropolis is wonderful. Highly recommended.\n",

The hotel provided great breakfast in the morning with ample food to eat to start the day. Excellent location with lots of shops, bars and restaurants nearby and easy access to the airport by bus, cab or train. The only downside to this hotel is that it was so noisy outside of our room that we hardly slept. Cars and motorbikes can be heard throughout the night and construction noise starting as early as 7 am!\n",

Our Superior room with balcony was not special but very nice and perfectly adequate. We changed our plans and asked for a third night. The hotel was very full so we had to move to a Standard room the last night. It was a little smaller but just as good overall. The staff was very helpful in arranging the third night as well as everything else. A very good breakfast included in the reasonable room charge.\n",

Situated in the center of Plaka district it is handy to the shops, eating places and sight seeing especially the Acropolis. The rooms though on the smaller side are clean, tidy and adequate. The staff are extremely helpful and polite. The breakfast was good.  You get an amazing view of the Acropolis from the roof top especially at night when it is flood-lit.

Good : location is right in the middle of everything, a lot of tourist attractions are only 11-15min walking distance away, hotel is surrounded by many many shopping, drinking and eating places. Event metro station is close by. Good breakfast is included. Bad : we had car service to and from the airport , make sure leave ample of time because definitely walking is faster than by car  because roads are so narrow and most one way around this hotel, traffic jam around this hotel before you can get to the bigger main road.\n",

The ladies in the breakfast room were super friendly and helpful. The room cleaning staff were superb, very attentive and super nice, some of the best I have met. Front desk folks were great as well. The only downside is the small room but you get what you pay for. It is fairly modern and clean though. Walking distance to every sight and metro is close by. Ton of restaurants and the famous market, right down the street. Very safe. Known for the roof view of the Acropolis which was great. Not a party scene but more of grab a drink and enjoy the view. Would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Review is :The Hotel Plaka is a European style hotel in the heart of old Athens. The location is fabulous--loved seeing the Acropolis lit up at night from the rooftop garden/bar and the balcony of our room.  The staff was incredibly hospitable and friendly and went out of their way to accommodate and assist us. They serve a great breakfast all morning--extensive offerings including Greek salad, potato salad, Greek yogurt, eggs, meats and cheeses, fruit, spanakopita, and the most wonderful Greek pastries. The rooms are very clean and adequate.  The noise is the downside--walls are paper thin and you can hear street noise as well as your neighbors. The people, breakfast and location--walk to most things--make it worth it.\n",

The complimentary breakfast was fine and they even had items for a continental breakfast available for our 2 am wake up to make our early flight home. The staff was very helpful - I had fallen and hurt my hand (turns out I had broken my thumb) before arriving and they were very helpful and prompt to bring me ice in a bag for it. The elevator is small but the steps were easy after walking the steps in Santorini before we arrived here. The view of the Parthenon from the roof at night was spectacular with tables and chairs and a bar.\n",

Panos at the Plaka Hotel is always the same - very pleasant and full of information when required and also very efficient at his position in reception.

Probably out of their control but was not offered another room and one of us is asthmatic. They did give us a late checkout. We had door to balcony open all night to get rid of smell and there was a bit of street noise. the only dwon side to the stay.\n",

The service at this hotel was perfect!! Reception staff were amongst the friendliest and most welcoming I met throughout Europe :). The highlight of this hotel is the rooftop bar! The rooftop is surreal, offering breathtaking views of acropolis.  Daily breakfast was lovely. Unfortunately the rest of the hotel was very Outdated and in need of refurbishment. The room itself was average, simple room, however clean. Bathroom also clean and modern. The bed was very uncomfortable.  It was very hard to sleep with the noise from the street and other guests. Overall I enjoyed my stay and do recommend this hotel…\n",

The Plaka Hotel was ideally located to do this, while providing great value for money in terms of hotel accommodation and service.  The adjoining rooms were as described, clean and more than adequate for our needs.  The breakfasts were excellent - in fact voted by the family as the best experienced during our four week trip - and support from desk staff was exceptional.  The rooftop view of The Acropolis was outstanding and a real \"bonus\" to our visit.  The proximity to excellent cafes/restaurants and shopping allowed us to maximize the Athens experience on foot.

Its location is definitely unique, right in the centre of the ‘suburb’ Plaka; walking distance to all the historical sights we wanted to see, shopping, public transport, and so many restaurants and bars you would find it difficult not to find something you like.  The roof top garden/bar is a must to see. The bar opens between 5.30 pm and 11.30 pm with views to the  Acropolis, but you can sit up there at any time during the day if you want dome sun.

      "Review is :I had previously had a nice stay at the sister hotel the Hotel Hermès, and decided to give the Plaka Hotel a try. It was great. The view from the roof bar was marvelous and the hotel was quiet and very comfortable. We really loved the bed and there was plenty of room, a nice clean bathroom, and a tv with many international channels. The location was great on a quiet side street within walking distance to two subway stops and all the main sights.  The lift is a little small so you might need to make two trips up depending on how much luggage you have. The staff at the hotel were kind and helpful. We would absolutely stay here again.\n",

Reception super friendly, hotel simple and clean, good size bedrooms and the there's the rooftop....while the bar set-up is pretty simple/no frills, the view across to the Acropolis is totally amazing and even more so at night.  Further, this hotel is right amongst a really good district - the Plaka - with restaurants, markets, coffee shops and a major train station right by.  Breakfast included which is plentiful and again, no fuss.  So tick's the boxes for location, service and value.   Easy to get from the airport by train should you wish or a fixed price taxi at $38EU.  Mind you, brace yourself for the taxi ride as there's a \"no-rules-no-limits\" kind of mentality compared to Aust!\n",

Shower had great pressure and temperature. Plenty of sockets. However, there was no tea/ coffee making facilities. Thankfully, we read previous reviews on Tripadvisor so came prepared. However, there is a mini-supermarket next door to stock up, which is a very useful. Staff were very helpful and friendly, in particular Amanda. Breakfast was a continental buffet.

The rooms are fine. The breakfast was a very good selection. Across the street is a building that has been abandoned with drop clothes, which is a sight sore. However, the location is excellent to get to all the major sites and walking distance to the Metro train. The frosting on this cake is the roof top bar that has a direct view of the Acropolis!!  It is phenomenal to sit watch the sunset and see the Parthenon light up. It's breath taking.  Highly recommend.\n",

During each of our visits we stayed in a different room and found each to be comfortable although one room showed some signs of wear.  On two occasions we had an Acropolis view that was exciting as this was our first visit to Athens.  These rooms were slightly larger than the room without a view and, for a short stay, worth the extra money. As noted by others, the Hotel has a beautiful rooftop bar/ terrace which affords a wonderful view of the Acropolis.

It is in the heart of the old city, where most of the ruins are, walking distance to the top of the Acropolis, good souvenir shopping, and cheap food at the touristy tavernas nearby.  (Go to Psirri district, also in walking distance, for better food, such as Lithos Taverna.) At any rate, what I didn't realize was the exceptional morning breakfast offered by this hotel.  I have not had a wider selection of food at a breakfast bar anywhere.

On departure day they actually had breakfast available for us promptly at 430AM as promised. That is the type service we evidenced in all our dealings with any of the staff.  Room was large, meticulously clean and even though we had a street facing room I was not kept up by any celebratory noise coming from the Plaka bars and restaurants which are only a couple of minutes walk away.

I got into Athens before the start of check-in, but the agent checking me in allowed me to check-in to my room so I can drop my bag and enjoy my short stay in Athens. He paid attention to detail during the check-in process and wished me a belated “Happy Birthday!” He let me know my room had breakfast and that I should also check out the rooftop for the amazing view of the Acropolis.  One of the reasons I chose the hotel is that I like being around the Monastiraki Metro Station. One of my favorite tavernas was just blocks away from the hotel where I could get take away gyros and enjoy in my room.  The room and the hotel is definitely dated, but it has a…\n",

The breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  Free afternoon tea and coffee served in the breakfast bar was a bonus and welcome respite to the day's activities.    The location was superb for shopping and site seeing, I caught the bus from the airport for 6 Euros and it was a simple walk down the street even with a couple of bags in tow.  A handy little supermarket next door meant I could buy fruit and snacks for the day out and about which saved me money.  Very welcoming.\n",

The hotel is very near the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, and a short walk to the Acropolis, central square and other tourist attractions.  The staff were very helpful.  I was in Room 610, which is a cozy size but fine for one person.  It has a double bed, decent size desk, chair, TV, luggage rack, cupboard, safe and fridge.

Both rooms were the compact size typical in city hotels but had comfortable beds, small fridges and effective air-con. The balcony was pointless, really - no chairs, and the space was taken up by two air-con units - but it didn't bother us as we used the breakfast room during the day (free tea and coffee) and the roof terrace at night.  Location is ideal - countless restaurants and shopping options on the doorstep, 10 minutes walk to the Acropolis, 30 minutes to the main Archaeological Museum.   Staff were very helpful, booking tickets, chatting to guests at breakfast, trying to track down a hat left on a tour bus etc.!\n",

      "Review is :Our family of four (2 adults, 2 teenagers) stayed at Hotel Plaka for five consecutive nights, and then one additional night after a few days in Santorini.  We had a family room, which is two adjoining rooms, and we felt that it provided us with plenty of space.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast and the many options it offered.  Additionally, it was nice to be able to ask questions of the staff person who is there to help with planning your day.  We came to really count on this each morning.  This hotel offers a laundry service that we did use and we were very pleased with how quickly the clothes were cleaned and returned to us.  We also appreciate that this hotel will hold luggage for you.  We went to Santorini for three days and then returned to Plaka Hotel for one last night. …\n",

We sat for 2 hours and watched while daylight turned to night and the lights slowly came on at the Acropolis. Even the hill side lights up. It is like time stood still, loved it. The room was large and the bathroom was a decent size. The lady that was at the bar that night on the rooftop was wonderful, she was so friendly and great to talk to. Breakfast was included which is a bonus and the staff were really helpful. Free wifi and we were able to have a cup of tea or coffee the day we arrived.\n",

We got off at the last stop and it was approx. an 8 min walk to the hotel. Check in was easy and the front desk concierge was friendly. The room was basic, just what we needed and was clean.  Great rooftop bar with a stunning view of the acropolis. The acropolis was also only a 15 minute walk away. We went at 7ish in the evening and it wasn't too hot which was nice.  breakfast was included and was pretty good. You must try their homemade spinach and cheese pie (spanakopita) it was delicious!\n",

And this hotel's location is amazing for those tourists with just a few days in Athens. Close to absolutely everything. Plaka area is probably the best area to stay.Food. Sights. Shopping. Only thing the area is not close to is beaches however that is anywhere in the centre of athens. The hotel itself is very clean. New towels etc daily. Breakfast was quite good and had a decent variety. Views depend on your room. Some have Acropolis views like we did but that is just luck I think as other rooms view is just the building right next door. The staff were actually verrry helpful. Had to leave at 5.30am to check out…\n",

The breakfast is wonderful and includes Greek specialities.  Also free tea/coffee and biscuits are available during the day.  The view from the roof is wonderful, especially at night when the Acropolis is illunminated.  The room was clean and spacious and the price in Feb/ Mar was very reasonable.  That time of year was perfect for weather and less tourists.  We also made use of the supermarket next door.  We would definitely stay there again!\n",

Suggest wearing good walking shoes with rubber soles to avoid slipping on granite steps and pathways qheading up to and in the acropolis.

Its in such a great location and everything is at your doorstep so if you are in Athens for a short amount of time or a couple of nights, this hotel is perfect. Lots of restaurants close by and little shops.  The reception staff were so nice (and funny)! we also got an upgrade to a bigger room which was great! Ladies --- if you are after some amazing (cheap) leather sandals head out of the hotel and turn to your left across the road you'll see a giant sandal shop!!!!! I was in shoe heaven!!!!  Also - head up to the roof top bar to get a view of the Acropolis, very nice!!\n",

The rooftop bar is nice and gives a view of the Acropolis which is quite serene. The breakfast is pretty standard for Greece. I did enjoy that they had a section with some Greek breakfast foods, such as the cheese pies and spinach pies.

Other negatives were an air con stuck on high all night and a door key pass that stopped working necessitating more up and down 5 flights of stairs ( lift only takes 3 so with 60 odd rooms it's rarely available).

If you are looking for hotel based on location, this is it.  The roof top terrace is also a major benefit.  The views are spectacular and a magical way to enjoy the Acropolis at night.  The major downside is the rooms pretty basic and institutional, not a place you want to hang out.  The room was small and had the feel of a dorm room.  Fine if you are spending your time sightseeing, but in brutal 100 degree days some might prefer better rooms and more amenities.  The staff were accommodating when we needed to check out early.

      "Review is :The hotel is in a great location around the corner from the flea market and in the midst of a plethora of cafes and restaurants. The staff are incredibly friendly and the rooftop bar offers fantastic views. The selection at breakfast was reasonably good and Wi-Fi was free and strong throughout the hotel.  The not so positive was my economy room which was very cramped and bereft of amenities. The shower had good pressure but water leaked under the door into the bathroom.   Air conditioning was good though and I had no problem with traffic noise. I’d probably choose a bigger room next time.\n",

      "Review is :Located midway between Monastiraki and Syntagma metro stations, we had two adjoining rooms. Both were clean with comfortable beds and modern bathrooms, and were small but sufficiently sized - we didn't spend much time beyond sleeping there. The included breakfast was fresh, extensive, with generous hours. The view from the rooftop bar can't be beaten. The reception staff were fluent in many languages and actively helpful. AC was quiet and effective. While we weren't disturbed by road noise, many guests returned through the small hours and the noise of the doors or giggles woke up one of us who is a light sleeper. But a highly recommended hotel: we would return here.\n",

The buffet breakfast was so good! We were not expecting such a delicious spread from a three star hotel. And although the rooms were small they were well maintained and clean and the best surprise of all was just how comfortable our beds were! The most comfortable beds in all our six week trip and we stayed in some very fancy hotels!  And you can't go past the rooftop bar with the amazing view, especially at night.

The view at night of the Acropolis is stunning and without par!  Loses one star because the carpet in the hall really could be cleaned and/or replaced.  Huge stain right in the middle of the hall.

Service until nearly midnight means you have plenty of time to relax,  The room was clean and spacious and comfortable.  The staff were extraordinarily helpful.

The best part was the concierge who wandered from table to table each morning offering advice on things we were considering doing that day, including the shortest ways to get there and back.  Rooms were decent sized and comfortable.  Only drawback was the uneven friendliness at the front desk, though that might partly be explained by English proficiency.\n",

The staff are very helpful, checking in with you every day over breakfast to find out what your plans were and if you needed any help.  Breakfast itself was good with a wide selection of continental/Greek/western items.  The real selling point for the hotel is the roof top bar, open from about 1730 which has amazing views of the Acropolis.  If you sit there there long enough, you can watch it change colour from sandy to golden to floodlit.    The only bad point  about the hotel is the lift - there is only one and it's tiny.

The room was comfortable and relatively large by European standards and had a good A/C unit which was welcome after a long day hiking around Athens.   There was…\n",

The rooms are typical European size so there small but clean and bed was comfortable. The vathroom small but shower had good water pressure and hot water. The roof top bar has amazing view of the acropolis. They have free WiFi and breakfast. Breakfast some warm food mixed with the typical cold meats and cheese and pastries. The staff was all very nice and helpful. If we return to Greece would stay here again.\n",

But you cannot beat the location! One street over is an area devoted to eateries and next to that a market street. Climb up to the roof garden, especially at night to enjoy the Acropolis\n",

The location was perfect for walking around Ermou and Monastiraki.  The breakfast was delicious, and we really enjoyed everyone who worked at the hotel -- they were all very helpful.  Rooms were a little outdated, but they were clean and comfortable.  Only negative I would say is that there is no air conditioning in the hotel, only in the rooms itself. It was very hot in Athens and it would have been nice to enjoy the second level of the hotel with air conditioning.   All in all, we would definitely stay here again.\n",

Plus, their location minutes from the Monastiraki station and close to all the main tourist activities is essential to making a tourist's life better.

Yes, newer hotels may come and go.....but none of them have changed my opinion. Previously, I'd stayed in rooms offered at the ferry boat docks, five star luxury hotels, and everything in between. However I have chosen the Plaka Hotel for the past 13 years (and will be returning again this year) because quite simply, the Plaka Hotel does everything right; providing the best all-around guest experience, comfort, superb location, and reasonable price of any of the Athenian hotels! The Plaka is our \"home away from home\".

The room was basic European standard but we did have a view of the Acropolis so that was nice to fall asleep to!  The rooftop bar was great - we went both nights before going out to dinner just to lounge in the chairs and stare at the Acropolis and watch the sun go down.  Definitely worth it just for that!  We had the breakfast the first day, which was fine - I would say nothing special but perfectly adequate.

Coming from the airport, it was an easy 7 minute walk from both where the bus stops (Syntagma Square) and the metro. All sights are within easy walking distance and there are tonnes of eating/shopping options.   Rooms are clean, breakfast buffet was decent for the size of the hotel. My friend is a coeliac and there was a great selection for her also. It was a bonus having the guest relations staff do the rounds during breakfast to help guests with questions and plan their days. The hotel kindly stored some of my luggage for me for over a week whilst i travelled around the country.  I would definitely stay here again the next time i'm in Athens.\n",

The ideal location was within walking distance to the best restaurants, shopping, and the city center of Athens. The Plaka neighborhood is very historic with its small streets and wonderful restaurants and souvenir stores for Athens. The best part of the hotel is the rooftop terrace with some of the best views of the Acropolis at night. You have to visit the rooftop terrace close to sunset and into the night for a cocktail and just soak in the views as well as a photo.

The rooms were clean and we even had a breath-taking view of the Acropolis! The breakfast was delicious and had numerous choices of foods.  One of the staff members would check on us during breakfast each day to make sure we didn't have any questions or to see if we needed help finding anything around Athens.  The rooftop bar is also fabulous and a great way to unwind after a long day of walking around seeing the history of Athens! Great location, great staff, and comfortable rooms!\n",

Staff cannot assist enough from booking cabs, to recommendations, to just asking how your day had gone. They really seem interested.

View from the roof was amazing- If i get a chance will upload my pictures.  Cons - the shower we had would over spill so the bathroom could be a small pool of water - easily fixed if they just changed the rubber sealer on bottom of glass door.  They also advertised the wrong closing times for some of the monuments which was annoying but easy mistake to make.\n",

Once we had unpacked we headed up to the rooftop bar for our first view of the Acropolis, it didn’t disappoint, so beautifully lit in the darkness high on the hill, we sat on one of the couches sipping red wine completely enthralled by this piece of ancient history.

We were given a room with a view of the Acropolis on the first night and when we returned we were very kindly upgraded to a superior room! Vasilis was lovely and always happy to help. Breakfast was great. The highlight for us was the rooftop and bar open till late, we really enjoyed going up there after dinner and having a drink - they have blankets for the chilly nights! The lady who runs the bar is also lovely and friendly. Would definitely go back.\n",

Highlights: - reasonable price - very friendly staff - full ( large) bag laundry for 9£  washed and delivered the next day - very friendly and helpful manager who comes around at breakfast to have a chat and check if you need anything. She gave us handy tips on going around - location is splendid, walking distance to everywhere - good selection of food at breakfast buffet - beautiful rooftop bar with views to the acropolis  Low lights - room is a bit small but adequate for sleeping - can be a bit noisy at night but this is possibly the same for all hotels in the touristy Plaka area - cleaning service only comes in late in the evening   Overall highlights definitely overcome the lowlights. Will definitely recommended…\n",

We asked for a room not near the elevator or steps (because of what I've read in the reviews) and that' what we got. A big room, excellent shower, great bed. very welcoming crew. good breakfast. On the negative point - no parking place near the hotel, there are some very small parking places nearby but they are mostly full. If you want to park your car you should go farther away. We got here on Easter's eve, and it turned out that due to a religious procession - most of the center was closed to cars. We were trapped in a terrible traffic jam for about 1.5 hours, it was impossible to get to the street we needed. When I called the hotel for advice they told me to park wherever I find a place, and to come by foot.…\n",

It's location puts many places you will want to go to within walking distance or jump on the Green Train for 5 Euro per day, The view from the roof is pretty spectacular\n",

Our rooms were standard ones and suitable for our visit, basically we needed somewhere to sleep and shower etc. The rooms had twin beds, a wardrobe, shower and toilet etc, Tv, and  telephone. The rooms were spotlessly clean and there was plenty of hot water for showering etc. Breakfast was very good plenty of variety, egg, bacon, sausages & beans as well as cheeses, meats, pies, pastries, cereals and of course juices and tea or coffee. There was plenty to set us up for our day of sightseeing. The roof top bar is a bonus and ideal for taking photos of the surrounding area especially the Acropolis, it only opened around 5.30pm but…\n",

The breakfast offered plenty of choice and the hotel provide free tea, coffee and biscuits until 5.30 every day which was a nice touch too. Our room also had a hairdryer which as a woman i thought I'd mention as i wish i had known this, shampoo and shower gel are also provided and Il add here that the shower was fabulous, powerful and with plenty of hot water. The location was great as we could walk to every attraction in the city from our base which saved a fortune in cabs.

Request a room AWAY from the elevator and stairs, higher numbered rooms indicate distance from the elevator on every floor. Also request an upper floor as these rooms will be quieter.

In fact , the hotel pretty much backs onto the Roman Agora with the Tower of Winds on one side, and Athens Cathedral on the other. Syntagma is a three or four minute walk. Another thing that is perfect about this hotel is how easy it is to get to from the airport.

It was easy to lose control of the hand held shower head, and there was a half-glass door.  It's fine, and hardly worth mentioning The daily breakfast was really good.

The view from the Acropolis view room we had (on 5th floor) was breathtaking...and just like the picture on its website (obvious, perhaps, but worth noting!).  3. The roof terrace view is, if anything, more impressive than the above as it also gives you a panoramic view across Athens which is almost as impressive as the Acropolis.  4.

      "Review is :This hotel is in a great location and is good value for money. Roof top terrace is lovely with great views. Only down side is the roof top bar is closed in winter but you can take your drinks up from downstairs. There is no 'proper' bar downstairs but this is not a problem as you are out and about a lot! Very clean, staff very helpful and my room was a good size. Did notice the church bells ringing when the Duomo reopened after a refurbishment though!!!  Great restaurants close by!  Would recommend if you don't want to pay 4 star prices.\n",

      "Review is :10 of us met at hotel Plaka for a birthday celebration weekend and found it to be perfect for our needs.  The location is central and easily accessible. The rooms are not huge but the accommodation is very comfortable and the shower is above expectation.  Breakfast was fresh and well staffed and the free coffee during the day appreciated after a days site seeing.  But the best part of hotel Plaka is the view from the roof terrace that is well stocked with sun beds and easy chairs and tables with a stunning view of the Athena.\n",

The Staff of the Hotel were extremely friendly and always eager to help! The breakfast area was lovely, the food selection was great - for both cold and hot food.  Of course what makes this Hotel extremely outstanding, is the rooftop bar! Which has a great view of the city but mainly provides a magnificent view of the Acropolis - specially at night, and if you're lucky to be there on a full moon - the moon lays right on top of the Acropolis.  Would definitely recommend!\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the Plaka hotel for a week in January with our 1.5yr old daughter. It was a great stay, the staff was very friendly, the breakfast super yummy! The location is unbeatable, you are in the heart of it all, walking distance to all the sights. It was rather chilly out, however our room was always comfortable. There is a mini fridge in the room, which was super helpful, because we were able to buy some milk for our little one and leave it in the room instead of having to rely on restaurants for milk. We all had a great time. The only downside, I think is that when we made the reservation we had to book a triple room, and the extra bed in the room just took up extra space, since our little one co-slept with us the entire time. We didn't ask to remedy this, so really it…\n",

Bathroom of good size (Adding a magnifier mirror would be a plus) - Breakfast room has large windows facing the street corner surrounded by trees - Food selection, very varied (even for my vegetarian daughter) with some delicious Greek delicatessen.

Upgraded to a superior room on arrival was a bonus, but to be honest the standard rooms are just as nice. Attentive staff and clean and comfortable rooms are just two of the positives from this centrally located hotel.\n",

      "Review is :First the positive points concerning Hotel  Plaka Economically priced if booking ahead . The location is excellent , slap bang in the middle of Athens centre , walking distance to most tourists sites . Clean rooms and bathrooms. The staff are very polite and helpful . The breakfast is available from early morning and is of a high quality . The views from some of the back rooms and from the roof top bar are lovely . Now the negative points concerning same hotel. Lift far too small ! Rooms could be made a little more welcoming , they are looking rather tired . Not enough towels provided, at least larger face towels please. The reception area could also do with a more welcoming make over . My room 207 had a small pice of carpet at entrance to room , with a large stain . Maybe it's…\n",

Breakfast was extensive, and the lounge was an unexpected surprise bonus with tea and coffee available all day.

      "Review is :You stay at this hotel for 2 reasons, ease of location and for the rooftop view.  Both are great!   The hotel is located in the Plaka district, one main street away from lots of shopping and food.  In the other direction is the Acropolis, about a 15-20 minute pleasant walk.   Also to be noted, we had to depart our hotel at 3am, and their restaurant on one of the upper floors had their breakfast buffet food ready to go (no one to serve you, just help yourself.)  The main bus stop area is about a 7 minute easy walk away.  (And it's busy at 3:30am too.)  Room was sufficient for our needs.  Nothing spectacular.  But the rooftop view was definitely spectacular, especially at night!\n",

Check-in and Checkout was very friendly and the morning breakfast buffet spread was very tasty with great variety.

This is a great hotel with a fantastic location, within walking distance of almost every thing you would wish to see in Athens, and priced to suit even a tightwad. The rooms are quite spacious for Europe, some with a view of the Parthenon, however these really are not needed as the rooftop terrace and bar, lures you to spend your evenings there, providing a magnificent view of the floodlit Parthenon and and this allied with the remarkable service of Elsa, who remembers every customer and their drinks, even weeks later, why would you lurk around your room?

The hotel was clean, the staff were very helpful and the breakfasts had a good choice of food. When we vacated the hotel on the last day I accidentally left my keys in our room and the hotel very kindly posted them to me at no extra charge.

(Authentic Greek yogurt, too.). The rooftop has incredible views of the Parthenon and history in every direction, along with three very sweet pigeons who look/act like doves.

The best areas to stay in Athens to experience the city sights include Monastiraki with quaint shops and restaurants along narrow pedestrianized streets, Plaka with more upscale shopping and dining, and Syntagma, the urbanized city center.  This hotel is in the Monastiraki area, not far from the other two.   This hotel is just 10-15 minutes easy walking to most of the sights in the city, the shopping districts and great outdoor dining.  The only time we used the metro was to visit the National Museum and that was in part due to the fact that it was raining that day.  Even the Benaki Museum and Lycabettus Funicular are easy walks although a little further out.   Most important, the hotel is just two blocks from the Monastiraki…\n",

Acropolis at basically eye level and right in front of you...need I say more. Price for hotel is a bit on the expensive side for what you get, as this is only a 3 star hotel. The other downside is that the elevator is tiny!!! It only fits…\n",

We were treated so well by the staff. The rooms were small but clean and our view was over the Acropolis itself. One of the lovely attractions of this hotel is the roof garden. The weather was in the night 20's and we had plenty of time and opportunity to enjoy the beautiful vistas. The breakfasts were very good. The hotel is also accessible to many lovely restaurants with great cuisine and wonderful traditional music. Highly recommended.\n",

We caught the train from the airport - a direct trip - to Monastiraki Station, then walked a quick 2 blocks through the markets to the hotel. I can't recommend the location enough.   We had a superior room, which was on the larger side and had a balcony overlooking the city streets. It was fine - not really noteworthy in a positive or negative way.   The rooftop bar is amazing - only a few drinks to choose from, but you're there for the view of the Acropolis, not the menu!\n",

Breakfast is good and the staff are very accomodating. A plus for us was that they would do your washing for about 10 euros a load.

Everything is in walking distance, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.   The only problem was that we could hear a church bell ring on the hour and half hour which woke us up a few times during the night and in the morning. It didn't wake us every time, but enough to be annoying.   Breakfast was great. Lots of choices (I loved the Greek yogurt with honey), some of which are out before the official breakfast start time of 7am if you're up early. Coffee is always available.   The rooftop has an amazing view of the acropolis and we enjoyed some wine and ouzo up there our first night. We were able to charge to the room, but I think they charged us an extra euro for that at…\n",

The rooms are of standard quality, we didn't have much of a view from our room - opened the curtains to scaffolding, we did ask whether another room was available at the same rate, however going in peak times meant an uplift of 70 euros a night for a view of the Acropolis.

The breakfast was plentiful with a good selection and set us up for the busy sightseeing days we had.  What this hotel has going for it is the location and the roof top terrace.

From the taxi drivers, waiters and shop owners all of the people we encountered were just wonderful. There was almost no language barriers and the city seemed very safe.

      "Review is :For us this hotel was perfect.  We had 3 days in Athens.  We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel (about 30 minutes and about 40 Euros).  The hotel is located in the middle of historic Plaka.  We were able to walk to all but one place we wanted to see.  We walked up to the Parthenon, went to the Acropolis museum, visited Ancient Agora, walked to Parliament and saw the changing of the guards, went to the National Gardens (it is more like a big park since it concentrates on tree species rather than flowers and provides a lot of shade, which is nice on a hot day) and walked to Congress.  We also went up and down the many side streets with so many vendors and something for everyone. We arrived at midnight (due to a delay with the airline) and we were welcomed warmly.  The…\n",

Well it is more like 360 degrees view of Athens, but the Parthenon view is the most up close given how close the hotel is to the site.  If you are driving to the hotel prepare your self to struggle with the parking and deal with traffic that is worst that NYC. Make sure you watch out for the people on scooters. They don't follow any rules and it's just a nightmare driving in Athens. I got lucky with the parking and parked right in front of the hotel. There are no meters, so if you park and don't move your car, you can be parked there for days without getting a ticket. But streets are tiny and the paid parking was 25E a day.  Rooms were clean and nice. City view, a bit noisy from the traffic, but…\n",

The roof terrace with views of the Acropolis is definitely a unique selling point of the hotel. But it's got more going for it than just this. Breakfast is delicious and plentiful - as good as you'd get in any 4-star hotel. Staff are SO friendly and professional. They greet you at breakfast one by one and ask you if you need any advice / help with exploring Athens, getting to the airport etc. They're also multilingual - English, German, French, Spanish etc. Quite impressive.

I kept seeing these amazing photos of the Acropolis at night and they all seemed to be taken from the Plaka Hotel Rooftop. The price was right and since we only had one night in Athens I wanted to make the most of it so I booked. The hotel room is nothing to write home about as it was very small and hard to navigate with a lot of luggage but it was clean and did the job.

The location of the hotel is what I'd rate it highest for. It's close to transport links, the Acropolis, local markets and restaurants/bars. Easy to pop back to if u forget something or need a nap!

Great central location, great view from rooftop bar and Acropolis view rooms, pretty good breakfast, tiny elevator, etc.   That said, my low ranking is because one male staff member was extremely rude and inappropriate to my wife and I.  Normally I wouldn't make a hotel's review based on that, but a quick search here of 'rude' reveals many past reviews mentioning one particular male front desk staff member, so it seems to be a pattern here at this hotel.  We stayed July 20 and 21 and I didn't get his name, but he was working at the front desk both nights at probably about 11pm and later.  We had three separate interactions with him to ask very typical and simple guest questions (things like a dinner recommendation, how to work…\n",

My (single) room was very small, but it had Acropolis view which is a big thing in Athens. All rooms numbering X10 and X11 have that view, starting from the 2nd or 3rd floor. The bathroom was also small but well designed and maintained. The appearance of the hotel is not as well-kept and stylish as the marketing suggests. Breakfast was okay, the buffet had some interesting local specialities but terrible coffee. The rooftop terrace was not in good shape. The bar opens in the late afternoon and is surprisingly pricey.\n",

However, if you have the right expectations you will probably be ok -  expect a very basic hotel (3 star) with dingy furnishings, limited service, old / tiny elevator, and crowded rooftop but with a great central location.    Pros: convenient location in walking distance from central square, acropolis, and several metro stations, rooftop (only open to 11pm) with lovely nighttime view of parthenon, large room with partial acropolis view   Cons: limited service at front desk, included breakfast was unappetizing, rooftop was crowded with students, uncomfortable beds   overall i would not stay here again…\n",

It's open all day - with the bar opening at 1730h.  The hotel is perfectly located for all the tourist stuff you need to do.  We stayed in the standard room - it was surprisingly good. Quite roomy, very clean with a nice modern bathroom. The hotel has free wi-fi which has very good speed.  We'd DEFINITELY come back here if I was to visit Greece again.\n",

      "Review is :Two of my friends recommended Plaka Hotel to me and it turned out they were right! The hotel staff went above and beyond to help us during our 3 night stay in Athens Greece. The rooftop view is worth the stay. The bartender was pleasant, funny and helpful! It was very relaxing after hot days in Athens to sit on a nice, breezy rooftop with the view I'll remember for a lifetime. The hotel was clean and the A/C in the room was ice cold, which was nice after the hot days in the city. A nice surprise was the complimentary breakfast. It included greek yogurt and feta cheese as well as other nice Greek specialties. Special thanks to the hotel management who took extra special care of us. The hospitality rivaled the hospitality I'm used to in Georgia, USA.\n",

We also gave them a huge bag of laundry which cost €9 only to wash, dry and fold in about 3 hrs. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The breakfast was okay.  There is a great view of the Acropolis from the roof top.  The hotel is central to all the major sights. We were very happy staying here.\n",

      "Review is :Plaka Hotel is well situated (as the name would suggest) in the Plaka District with all main sights within walking distance.  Getting to the hotel from the airport was a breeze as it is very closely located to Monastraki Station.  Many places to eat/shop close by.  The view from the top floor terrace of the Acropolis were spectacular.  Ensure you head up here for a drink in the evening.  Buffet breakfast offered a great variety of choices.  Only downside was the lifts, they are old and small but that's just the way they were made I guess!  Stairs were often easier and faster.  Didn't really have a lot of contact with the staff, other than a simple hello and goodbye upon arrival/departure.\n",

      "Review is :Stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of July with my wife. We had a room on level 6 with an obstructed view of the acropolis which was still OK. If you want a great view you just walk up 1 level to the rooftop bar. The view from the Rooftop bar is sensational, I have stayed in 3 others hotels in Athens previously that don't have as good a view as this place. The location again is the best if you want to spend your time around the Plaka and Monisteraki. We found the service very good with no issues at all except the lift broke down for a few hours however you were still able to use the service elevator. The breakfast was very good with freshly cooked eggs the way you want them and plenty of other things to eat. The room itself I found quite comfortable, not modern but clean…\n",

No drink making facilities (if you like a cuppa in the morning you'll need to bring a kettle!) shower gel, shampoo and soap were provided daily, as was clean towels. Hair dryer. Decent sized bed, TV - English channels were very pixilated and the sound was bad. Bathroom, small I thought. We had a balcony but not all rooms have one and most importantly air condition. There is a safe in the room operated by the door key card.  The wardrobe had 6 coat hangers, and 4 shelves.

Even though the room was a bit small we found it to be quiet and they have a good internet connection if you want to use wifi.  I would say this is a must stay if you're in town.  Its not a huge hotel but it has everything going for it.  If we come back to Athens we'll be staying there again for sure.\n",

We enjoy smaller boutique hotels with character and Plaka Hotel fits that profile.  Yes it has a small lift (normal for older hotels in Europe) but it isn't an issue.  We learned years ago to send spouse with luggage up to room first and either walk up or wait for lift to join them.  The view from the roof is truly worthy of a postcard.  Very good European style breakfast (we actually look forward to the breads, cheeses, meats, fruits, etc).  Syntagma Square is just a few blocks away and the launch point for a number of tours.\n",

This small boutique hotel has a wonderful breakfast everyday with food to suit every nationality, and the concierge and front desk personal are always there to accommodate you. The rooftop bar has a wonderful view of the Acropolis and the city and we went up there every evening to relax. We spent 2 weeks at this wonderful hotel in early April and would certainly go back in a heartbeat!!\n",

I gave it a little lower rating because we didn't think the breakfast buffet was worth the high ratings most were giving.  It's good for Europeans, but not so much for Americans.  The elevator is extremely small, so you walk up and down marble steps several times a day to your room. We also found the man at the front desk during the day to not be very helpful or friendly.  The later afternoon shift was much nicer. The rooftop area is wonderful!\n",

Breakfast was included and there was a good variety of hot and cold dishes. The hotel was close to the market square and there were ruins up side streets.  The hotel was close to the tour bus stop and to the metro railway station, but a word of caution, our friends arriving on the train had a group of pick pockets target them. A young girl with a group of five well dressed young men crowded around them and the young girl took out a map so no one could see the boys hands unzipping their bags. It all happened very…\n",

There was kind of an odd overflow of noises into the bathroom, but not where we slept.

The front desk staff made things very easy!   Rooms:  They located us on the same floor.  The rooms were a good size by European standards.  They managed to get luxury bathrooms into a small space.  The beds were very comfortable.  The rooms maximize small space well and feature a small fridge with drinks for purchase.  There is no coffee or tea maker- I wish they would add them.  The automatic blinds were wonderful, also great for blocking out street noise.   Staff:  5 stars from valets, to front desk.   Location:  perfect for all the sites!

The cafe on the roof is perfect. It was never too crowded, the staff is very friendly. The view is incredible. You have almost a 360 degree view of the city, including of the acropolis.

All rooms get a standard breakfast; I had to know how to spend the credit & plan ahead of time.   Room tip: room 612 was great! Large in size, room for 3 checked luggage. Quiet.

Terrific location - an easy walk to the Acropolis, Plaka, Syntagma, etc. Many great restaurants in the Plaka (we ate at most of them.) Rooms were small but comfortable. Hotel was extremely clean and conscientiously maintained.  Lovely roof top restaurant and bar with great views of the city.

      "Review is :5 stars  Great modern, art design hotel. Extremely clean with wonderful staff.   Spent one night as a last minute booking. Booked directly! Staff were so accommodating and the room was perfect.  Clean, spacious on the first floor.  Art design hotel with lots of wonderful design aspects. Really appreciated this as an interior stylist and Airbnb Superhost! Great vibe in rooftop bar overlooking Lycabyttos Hill.  Breakfast was great. As a celiac it’s hard to find good options but they made me an omelette with smoked salmon and avocado gluten free toast!  Downstairs Gym and spa and massage facilities looked great although I didn’t get a chance to use them but definitely on my next visit.  Totally recommended this great hotel that’s centrally located.\n",

We arrived in the early hours of the morning after a late flight but were greeted by a friendly receptionist who took the time to explain all the information we would need to settle into our room.  The room was small but adequate for a short stay.  It was designed to accommodate the limited space fairly well with a decent wardrobe and drawers, TV and toiletries daily with fresh towels if required.  The one thing I would mention is bathroom has a toilet and shower unit inside with the wash-hand basin outside (which was the first thing you see as you enter the room).

Minutes walking distance from Syntagma station for easy metro access to city and airport and super easy 5-10 min walk to the heart of the tourist attractions and South Acropolis entrance. But also on the edges of the heart of Plaka and within easy walking to downtown areas.  For a small boutique hotel, the service was fantastic. Very well trained team here. From front desk staff, to doormen, to F&B staff and housekeeping. All friendly, professional and do have attention to detail.   Rooms were a surprise, usually design hotels are form over function.

This was a summer when temperatures were over 100 degrees F and the only way we could take the walk up there was to leave at 8 in the morning while it was still cool -- and less crowded.  I had been there in 2019 but wanted to go back and I really enjoyed the lovely walk there from the hotel.  There is also a restaurant/bakery across the street that serves cappuccino and breakfast to take back to the room which was convenient.  We had dessert on the top of the hotel one day at sunset for spectacular views too.\n",

As soon as we arrived, we had lunch on the rooftop with a perfect view of The Acropolis. The food was outstanding and our waiter (I believe his name was Mihalis) was the BEST. Not only did he make us some incredible cocktails, he was so fun to talk to!

The Syntagma train and metro station is also a 5 minutes walk for longer commutes.  This is a very quirky hotel, clearly a lot of effort went into the design. The lobby walls are mesmerizing, and even the couches and chairs throughout the property are unique.   The rooms are on the smaller side, but are comfortable and again the design is very nice. The only thing we did not like is the bathroom situation, particularly with the toilet/shower combo that is quite awkward.  Our room was on the 5th floor (out of 6), and was facing the street.

Our airline lost all three of our checked bags and the front desk team worked with the airport on finding the luggage day and night.

The side of the roof they tended to have open though did. It face the Parthenon directly.   From the start to the end serice was very good - especially the gal who worked the roof when we were there and also breakfast.  Kids at home and she was alway there!   …\n",

The best part was the rooftop terrace with the view of the Acropolis. We had an amazing dinner during sunset time with an incredible view.   Like all Hotels of the YES Hotels Group “New Hotel” has its own concept. For example, they didn´t get rid of all the old stuff of the former Hotel in this building, but they renewed it and used it to highlight the interior.  It was really amazing to see the effort they put into designing and concepting every single hotel. Once you are in Athens you have to check it out. I totally recommend staying in one of their hotels once you are in Athens. The people working there are super friendly, every space is clean…\n",

There was never a response to our first two mails, only our third mail after several months was answered and the hotel told us that they could not transfer the miles back to the Aegean account or give us at least a cancellation invoice that we could claim from our travel insurance. They just took our money for nothing! I have never experienced such a customer-ignoring behavior from a company and will never consider this hotel chain again in the future!!!\n",

      "Review is :Love the décor and design of the hotel. Not the biggest and posh type, but definitely hip and modern. Space in the room was cleverly maximized, spacious bathrooms with dual showers. Bed and linen is comfortable enough.  Rooftop bar ( The Art Lounge ) is awesome with a great view of acropolis, we are there every night before we end the day. Gym is average though.  Location wise, 5min walk from the square, and at the beginning stretch of Plaka. Walking distance to the main attractions. Personally, I very much prefer Plaka area to Monastiraki, hence I really enjoyed staying at this hotel, except that the gym is not complete ( which I guess is common in Athens )\n",

      "Review is :Once stood here the Palace hotel for 50 years. They have utilised the old furnitures of days bygone and decorated the walls with it. It’s tremendously creative.  The hotel has great attentive service with  a genuine happy feeling to the place. The door staff were friendly and super welcoming.  The bar staff are dashing and add the flair to the bar - which is worth a visit for them and the view!  The breakfast is good but the breakfast staff seemed flustered and it made for a bit of a stress filled morning.  Overall this was the best hotel we could have picked for our quick stop in Athens.  It’s a smashing hotel and super close to everything.\n",

The rooms are clean and the staff is very helpful and very friendly. The rooftop restaurant is really good, with a very good wine list and an amazing view of the city, including the Parthenon (although I recommend a reservation if you want this view). They also serve breakfast in the lobby floor, which was also quite good and very convenient.   The location is excellent - right next to the Plaka neighborhood with lots of local restaurants and bars.

The location is another thing to consider everything is walking distance to the \"Plaka\" which I believe is the center of the city. Athens is one of the safest place to walk around even at night time. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops around you! (KFC, MACDONALDS, STARBUCKS and lots of local places to choose from).

There are a lot of restaurants and shops close to the vicinity of the hotel, and it is only 5-10 minutes walk to Plaka which is very convenient.

The room, while not being large, was what you would expect size wise in any major city (NY, Rome, Paris). It was very comfortable with a very large shower. The location of the hotel made walking through The Plaka a joy. Dinner in the Art Lounge on the roof was delicious with a great view of the Acropolis.

The decor of the hotel was very cool. The room was a good size, with a comfortable bed. The two frustrations I had with the room were the lack of any coffee machine and the fact that the bathroom towels were in the bedroom, which no one explained.

      "Review is :The New Hotel in Athens is just perfect: Great location, friendly staff and you can sleep very well  The rooms Of course the rooms are very original, they are well designed and have some unique features. With plenty of lights and switches you can create your own ambiance. The shower is large and works well. The best part is that the rooms are quiet and dark and cool. The electric blackout curtains do not let any light in so that you can sleep any time of the day. The AC works really well and is as quiet as you like. Because the hotel is on a quiet side street, away from the hustle and bustle of the center, the street noise is very limited. So, for us it was one of the best hotel rooms ever. The size is decent for being in the middle in Athens, not very large but absolutely…\n",

      "Review is :The New Hotel has a good location for exploring and walking. If you are seeking a good run, from here, one could run along pedestrian road that goes right past the base of the Acropolis (you'd need to add content). We walked to Lycabettus hill (furnicular up and walked down), the Acropolis, Monastiraki Square and more, so we had plenty of exercise. Athens is a good walking town.  The entire hotel is funky and fun. The lobby is not too big, but it is busy with hotel tourists.  Room sizes are OK for a city hotel.  Pick a room with a nice view if you can.  Our view was simply of apartments across the narrow street - not so interesting.  Also, if a party is planned on the 7th floor, you might want to be on the 5th floor or below.  The balcony in our room was nice early or late in…\n",

This small boutique hotel is well located just off Syntagma Square near the Plaka district and within easy walking distance of the Acropolis, ancient Agora, Odeon of Herodes Atticus, etc. Our \"Junior Suite\" was comfortable and very quiet. The service in this hotel is both cheerful and just about flawless. Restaurant recs and reservations; tour reservations; taxis...everything quick and smooth. The morning breakfast buffet was very nice although it became a bit repetitive over the course of our stay. Recommended without qualification.\n",

The bathroom is just two glass panels beside my bed with a poky shower right next to the toilet. The sink is in the room on the other hand. There is no pool and the spa and wellness facilities are miniscule. You can only fit one person at a time in the hammam and the hot tub is literally a bath like you would have yourself in your house with some jets in it. Looks like they bought it in a diy store and only fits one person. Fitness space also small. I'm not able to see the roof terrace either since it's booked the whole day for a private event. Very disappointing for a 5 star.\n",

Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Patio outside is a cool to have but we hardly used it. The gym is small but does the job! The best part is their rooftop Art lounge bar and restaurant.

I arrives early, and reception and the hotel team welcomed me with drinks and a little Greek snack.. whilst checking me in.. they were all extremely helpful .. and as I had a few hours to spare.. as a bonus they give you a free entry into the acropolis museum..   The hotel is in a wonderfully Central location a few mins walk from Syntagma square.. Temple of Zeus and the Acropolis.. and off a main Street so it's quiet.  As it was a short trip we had dinner on the rooftop bar/restaurant which has wonderful views of the city and a great view of the acropolis. The food and drink recommendations were excellent in line with everything at the hotel.  A special thanks to the receptionist and waiter who looked after.. wonderful service!\n",

All their staffs are extremely nice and helpful. Everyone! No matter the reception, bell boy, house keeper, waiters. They all have a smile on their face. When I checked out, dont know why there is other people who had dinner at their restaurant but signed the bill in my room.  The manager I guess helped me to cancel it dont even need 5mins. The bell boy I met used like 10 mins to introduce me the feature at rooms.

Breakfast options were quite good,  although the omelette I special ordered had no flavor at all (Suggestion: better quality eggs needed). I Went to the 7th floor bar to meet friends for cocktails. Drinks were tasty and reasonably priced. Suggestion for the bar- Have more \"lounge\" furniture rather than straight back chairs and have less bright lighting.

It truly was a little gem in the design space, and the staff was wonderful BUT I would never stay there again. To me, the design trumped function in some key areas. For example, like so many newer modern hotels, they used a glass door on the toilet room. It was frosted…buuuuut…you get the idea. So thank you for a glass door directly across from the bed so there is basically no privacy or “mystery” left, if you catch my drift. Also, like so many newer boutique hotels trying to save space, the sink area outside of the toilet room has zero space to put anything. So you’re standing there kind of awkwardly juggling…\n",

Light and plumbing fixtures were upscale, as was a wood and glass armoire..  Not a lot of downsides, but I may as well convey: the hotel is in a very noisy, tourist section. The desk will give you ear plugs so you can sleep. I had two different rooms, neither of which had a view, so if they have one you need to ask.

Booked on spg.com just to find a day before our travel very same room type 40% cheaper on other website. Contact the hotel to ask if they will be willing to provide credit to be used in the hotel for the difference or to make a new booking and cancel the flexible one booked. After two exchange of emails they send a further one saying that the time is up and to late to make any change in the bookings... namely they waited until the last minute and force us this way to keep the expensive booking for no reason....what a cheap and dishonored way to behave! I doubt if they see us at the ‘New Hotel’ again.\n",

      "Review is :A very well located hotel in Athens central, but the design leaves a lot to be desired. Dining room and lobby pillars are covered in odd pieces of timber, haphazardly fixed in such a way it is a real dust trap, and totally unhygienic in the dining room as it is impossible to remove the dust which was on display. The rooms were small, ( not unusual for Europe) but why paint the tiny bathroom in a dark colour? Why have bronzed type mirrors to make the effect even darker. Why have a shower door which does not move over the shower mat, but rather pushes it aside, making the floor wet and slippery. Suggest, raise the shower basin floor, adjust the height of the door so it can open over the mat. Than there a large proliferation of light switches, which take some time to come to grip…\n",

Overall we had a good experience but I would just like to add that it was a bit overpriced for what felt like a boutique hotel, although it truly is amazingly designed and high-class standard, it still lacked the 5-star touch which is why I believe it to be overpriced. apart from that, overall good experience.\n",

The staff was willing to assist and had professional attitude. We had a room only rate and ate mostly out of the hotel.

The location was probably the best feature - walking distance to Acropolis, Plaka, Monastiraki, and Syntagma Station if you care to venture further. The kitschy decor in the lobby and rooms gave a fun vibe. Room was small but made good use of the space. We actually thought the doubling of the bathroom door as the shower door was pretty clever.

You would have to see it to appreciate it, but it was super cool.  In our room, one wall was covered with the blue glass \"evil eye\" decorations you see everywhere in Athens.  They were converted to lights.  Super cool.  Breakfast - probably best tasking eggs I can ever remember having anywhere.  Just a great stay in every sense.\n",

The washbasin is actually outside the bathroom ( I think this may be a Greek thing, but still quite weird! )  Aside from toiletries and 1 bottle of water, there were no other amenities (i.e. no coffee/ tea possibilities).

Staff was very professional and did everything they could to make our short stay a very pleasant one. What we really like is that you definitely are staying in a cookie cutter room with \"evil eye\" lighting on the wall and very distinctive bathroom vanity, unlike any you are bound to see. The blackout shades were exceptional. The only complaint I would had albeit a small one, is that in the early mornings we could hear street noise coming from the bakery across the street.\n",

I was also informed that my gold SPG status held no value here as there were only an affiliate of SPG. I very rarely was greeted upon entering or exiting the building.  2. The Wi-Fi is spotty at best. This should never be an issue and it needs to be corrected.  3.  Bathroom door situation is bizarre. The shower door doubles as a toilet door.  4.

      "Review is :Located in the centre of Athens, just off  Syntagma Square, so within walking distance of most major attractions.  There is a beautiful church just across the road and it’s a very short stroll to the National Gardens.  The bars and restaurants of Plaka are five minutes away.  The hotel itself is modern, boutique style, with individually designed rooms.  There is some traffic noise, but that’s probably inevitable given the central location.  Rooms very comfortable but quite warm and the air conditioning didn’t seem to be very effective - not really an issue for late March, but maybe a problem in the summer months.  Nice rooftop bar, great breakfast (cold buffet, with eggs cooked to order).  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended.\n",

Thank god I did- as soon as I arrived in the hotel, the ambience is calm and staff were very welcoming. We arrived on the bank holiday Sunday  so there were no taxis and had to carry our luggage from the Titania all the way here. The doorman immediately helped us with our luggage and got us some water. I found them very helpful throughout my stay.  I stayed in a superior plus room, and my colleague in a standard- both of which were super comfortable. Bathrobes, slippers, nice toiletries, great design. And mine had a lovely balcony and a view into the hills and the old church in front. The road in front is a little noisy…\n",

I wouldn't say this was a bad experience, it wasn't, there were just too many things wrong to make it the experience I hoped for.  Things like the room temperature being hard to make comfortable, the roof top bar not having any staff on our first visit and the maid repeatedly banging on the door on the morning of checkout despite it being more than an hour before check out time.  All little things, but these and others add up to spoiling the experience.  Great location close to all the central Athens amenities, plus really helpful and friendly staff made up for a lot.\n",

You can grab a cocktail in the \"New Taste\" Bar at the ground floor where greeks and foreigners become one. We would absolutely recommend the restaurant on the Rooftop \"Art Lounge\".

The hotel is very conveniently located for most of what visitors will likely be trying to see in Athens.  This means, however, that there is a reasonably high amount of street noise that can be heard in the rooms, so it might not be the best place for light sleepers.  The rooms are comfortable if a little small.  There is a major design focus which may appeal to some travelers.  The lounge on the top floor offers nice views of the Acropolis and a comfortable place to unwind.  The staff are generally quite helpful.  Breakfast spread is very nice.\n",

Negatives: Breakfast is not included, unless you upgrade. Which isn't a problem considering there are several AMAZING places to eat nearby. But the cost for the bare bones package is still way too pricey for your accommodations.   There is no welcome package, and our room wasn't ready when we arrived. Had to wait 2 hours.

The hotel is a modern reworking of an older hotel in the same building. Many of the wooden items from the old hotel are incorporated in the new decour. Regular rooms are compact but have everything you need. On the downside the bathroom has a frosted glass wall separating it from the sleeping area. Light turned on during the night could awaken other occupant. Beds are very comfortable and bedding is excellent. Bathrobes provided are for short, anorexic individuals.

The location is central.   But, I never slept there! I had to have an emergency surgery the very night we arrived. My husband called the hotel the next day to tell them we were late for check-out because of what had happened. The staff packed our bags for us, let my husband come and shower in the room well after our stay should have ended, and then...THEY REFUSED TO CHARGE US. In general, my experience in Greece was characterized by this kind of extreme human kindness, but the staff at the New Hotel deserves a big pat on the back for the way they treat their guests. I…\n",

And, there was one especially outstanding service that I'll never forget.

It had large wet room and a very conforltable bed. Ours had a small terrace and was quite well insulated from the street. Breakfast was included in our deal, it's quite a predictable affair and absolutely nothing to complain about. The coffee was especially good, with well cooked hot extras, eggs were boiled or scrambled to perfection and there was a rare choice of interesting seedy, nutty bread.

It's not my first choice, but it's definitely “good enough” when other options are not available.  Prices can also be competitive, making it very good value.\n",

We had a delicious Ceasar salad for lunch on the roof terrace from which you can see the Acropolis.  The Plaka is just a few blocks away, as is Syntagma Square, so the location is truly exceptional.  The breakfast room off the small lobby was packed for breakfast, so we had coffee and a bite to eat across the street with the busy Greeks hurrying off to work. The decorations in the lobby and in the rooms are trying to hard to be trendy, and in the end, just come off tacky.  But all the staff were lovely and helpful.

Being in the heart of Athens, you can expect some street noise as we experienced, with garbage trucks at night.   However, it was short lived.  The rooftop bar is pleasant for a drink or two whilst viewing the skyline, and breakfast has a good variety of choices.

The old hotel had been gutted and this new hotel was put together with all of the elements from the hotel including the furnishings. The hotel was easy to get to.

We had just arrived in Athens to kick off our honeymoon and the staff delivered fresh snacks to the room to welcome us. We really appreciated the excellent service and the modern amenities. Unfortunately we had to check out at 5 AM the following morning to catch a ferry so our stay was brief, but the hotel even provided us with a boxed breakfast to take with us!\n",

When we first arrived they were able to check us in early, which was great as we had a tour in a few hours and wanted to lay down and relax for a bit. The lobby had an artsy vibe with pieces of wooden chairs on the walls. The room was very spacious with a separate living room. There were so many different light switches we had an interesting time figuring out which one was for what. (probably like 15-20 switches in the room). The Asst. General Manager came out to greet us and let me know due to my gluten and dairy allergies, they had labeled all the breakfast for the following morning so I was aware what I could…\n",

Complimentary breakfast was good, different compared to what we are accustomed to in the states but still good, your greek yogurt was on point!

The rooms themselves again look fabulous, but some of it is design which looks nice, but sadly doesn't work. The sink arrangement in the rooms looks great, but just isn't practical as it doesn't go up to the mirror at the back so things kept falling down. My girlfriend also said it had obviously been designed by a man as the mirror was smoked glass so utterly useless for putting make up on (wouldn't have noticed myself!) Certainly worth staying at as great location, place looks great and breakfast was excellent, but if you are a woman, you may wish to try somewhere else!\n",

But the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was a bit dicey -- as evidenced by the guard in the bulletproof vest out front of the hotel.   The hotel staff was excellent.  They were all anxious to make your stay comfortable.    The decor of the hotel is young and funky -- the halls are covered in leather, the artwork is very new age, and the furniture is somewhat edgy.  This must be appealing to lots of people, but I prefer function over form when it comes to hotel rooms.  For example, the bathroom walls are all frosted glass or mirror glass and the sink area is in the main part of the room.  If one person wants to get up early, it is…\n",

The evil eye icons are a main decorative feature in the rooms and are very cool! Full sliding glass doors with electronically controlled privacy/heat blocking screen. The small bar/cafe on the roof is handsomely appointed with great views of nearby churches, expansive views of sections of Athens and the great view of the Acropolis. It is located adjacent to the Plaka district with many shops and restaurants.  I had breakfast in the Hotel and it was excellent.\n",

      "Review is :I had heard great things about the top-floor New Hotel Art Lounge restaurant. I visited it yesterday and was very disappointed. The environment was very nice, with great views towards Lycabettus Hill and Syntagma Square, but the service was bad and the food, well, awful. I had two fish dishes, one with scallops and one with sole fish, and in both cases they had that strong fishy smell that tells you that it's been a while since they've seen the see. The ground floor bar/dining area was also closed that day for some reason. In general I had the impression that the hotel is not doing that great.   Note that I did NOT stay at the hotel - I only visited the restaurant.\n",

None of them can hold a candle to  NEW!  Which you'll notice upon entering the NEW Hotel- the aroma therapy candle scent.    I must say this tiny unique boutique hotel, nestled quietly away in the heart of downtown Athens is one in a million.  From its unique architecture, incredible views, inviting aroma therapy scent, fitness center, breakfast, amazingly well appointed  (yet minimalistic) room, cleanliness- and incredibly friendly staff (especially Panos), I had the pleasure of spending almost two weeks at this unique hotel.   As an allergy sufferer, I felt very comfortable here- due to the \"New-Ness\"; cleanliness, an minimalist decor…\n",

Our room had a balcony, plush bed and pillows, blue \"evil eye\" lights. On several occasions we enjoyed the rooftop bar (try the dirty blonde!). Great location--we walked all over Plaka, to the national archaeological museum, to the Acropolis, even back from Mt. Lycabettus. The staff helped us find our way around, made restaurant recommendations, and always welcomed us back. Breakfast was substantial--eggs made to order, great croissants--and good value as it was included in our room rate. I could go on, but most of it has been said. We'd certainly return if we are ever back in Athens.\n",

We could see the Acropolis from our room (503) on the second stay. The rooms are stylish and very clean.

Room - slightly quirky but in a good way.  A nice relief from a standard business room.

The hotel has a very nice interior using the material from the previous hotel as decoration.  Breakfast is good with their self baked bread and plenty of choice. Make sure though that when you order tea that you ask the water to be boiled, otherwise it is not drinkable.  Location is close to Syntagma Square in Plaka, the touristic district.

Breakfast was ok but nothing special. The tables were standing very narrow to each other to pack more guests in so zero privacy.   But as I assumed the location was ok as I could walk to the Akropolis in 10 minutes. Also there were some nice Greek restaurants in walking distance. As my purpose was just tourism it served my needs and I am recommending it. But next time I might try out a different hotel.\n",

Centrally located to all the major attractions, we actually never took the train anywhere.  We walked to the Acropolis, temple of Zues, Flea Market, Syntagmos Sq. Etc..  Walking distance to all the restaurants.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.   My husband and I scheduled a spa treatment : I did the 1.30 hr massage w mini facial and my husband did 60 min massage w Sofia. My massage was excellent, being 5 months pregnant she was very careful and informative!  Highly recommended the hotel based on the location, staff, nearby choices etc...  Warning: the shower wall is a semi see through wall, if traveling w.someone other than your significant other, may get awkward.\n",

Check-in was seamless and quick topped of with a heartfelt welcome. Our room was on the fifth floor with a glimpse of the Acropolis. The room was not that large, but comfortable and modern but with still that homely and welcome feel. The bed, super comfortable, the shower massive. The in room safe was also huge, and added bonus. The room was serviced daily and what really impressed me is that we were never bothered by housekeeping. The \"Do not disturb\" sign on the door meant exactly that. Everyone respected that unlike some other hotels. Breakfast, to die for. Really great variety to our taste and the service was great. We were…\n",

Even though we did not have a reservation we were told there was a table available at the rooftop, something that made us very happy. Our first impression was really good, however as time went by we started being disappointed by the service and the quality of the food. Our order included pancakes, an omelette, a tart, a cappuccino and a fresh fruit juice. The pancakes were cold and the juice was rather disappointing. The mushroom tart was overly cooked and overall the taste was not what we expected, especially when the prices of the menu are quite high. Final detail has to do with the service, even though it seemed like a rather slow day, it took them…\n",

Not enough light in the bathroom, which was quite odd.  I'm a guy so I don't wear makeup, but I do wear contact lenses.  The lighting in the bathroom in front of the mirror was terrible; inadequate for seeing much of anything in the mirror.  Seems like a poor design to me, since all the lights were working. 2.  Broken drain in the bathroom sink.  Not a huge deal. 3.  Instructions for turning on the TV were incorrect.  Had to call someone to the room to show me how to turn it on.

They are serious about the number of guests in the room. We got charged $80 for a child that was included in the reservation that we made on a mobile app and the option simply was not there. I wasn't happy with this and didn't think it was fair and sent an email to SPG to let them know how their app cost me extra money. I also heard them do this to a couple other guests so this must be standard practice.  The location is a 5 min walk to the acropolis and to the local eateries and shops.

Of real import is infrastructure is all up to date, heat and AC work properly, the rain shower is US style. Some few distractions were a too soft mattress, single sink, make up mirror on the desk vs the usual location. There is also some quirky art used to decorate which doesn't add much if it adds at all. Some street noise could be annoying but especially the loud bells from the adjacent church.  The door staff is awesome and 'on it' at all the right times.

      "Review is :This modern hotel is fantastic.  It's in a fantastic location to walk to everywhere!  We only had 2 days so the one full day, we walked to everything and according to my watch, did almost 12 miles!  What an amazing City!  The New Hotel has fantastic customer care & staff & the rooms are funky good for the most part.  King size beds! Cons:  1 small elevator; the bar on the top floor has lousy service (the prices are spendy and we would have eaten there but it was like pulling teeth to get a 2nd drink order - easier to go next door and eat & drink locally and much, much cheaper!); out bath vanity was very tiny and bath area was very close to the bed considering how the layout of the room was. All of this being said, I would still re-book at this hotel!\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the New Hotel for two nights at the beginning of our 12-night Greece vacation.  The front desk staff was very helpful and our room was small yet very clean.  We enjoyed drinks at the bar and had no issues however dinner on our last night wasn't the best experience.  They were not very attentive and despite having an amazing table with picturesque views, the food just didn't live up to the expectations.  And while I rarely complain about the price of food (it's where my husband and I choose to spend money) knowing that I could have eaten a meal that was a 100% better for half the price was disappointing.  Oh - but to end on a high note - the breakfast was awesome and the perfect start to our day.\n",

The roof garden lounge is excellent as well as the ambiance of the ground floor restaurant.   A pool could have been included in the spa and the breakfast could have been richer in choice -although everything is very fresh.   Location is ideal for the Attica Mall, Sytagma, Ermou and Plaka areas. Overall, an excellent experience.\n",

Immediately upon entering this property in the center of Athens, I was greeted with the most delightful of welcomes. From its unique, artistic, and gorgeous decor to the housekeeping to the bellmen to the ladies at the front desk to the delicious breakfast spread, New Hotel exemplifies pristine attention to detail and clearly values the guest and the guest experience.   I felt so taken care of throughout my stay. Everyone goes above and beyond. The girls at the front desk were fantastic! I specifically spent a bit of time with - pardon my spelling here - Stefana and Matilda, and they were true gems! Always checking in to ensure my stay was pleasant and ever accommodating.  …\n",

When we returned that evening to retrieve the tickets/vouchers the man wasn't the friendliest and told us he was not aware of any tickets/vouchers for a tour.

Located in a very safe area of Athens; minutes from the Acropolis and Plaka with a wide variety of restaurants nearby. The staff was great; they all spoke English very well and I found them going out of their way to help my husband and I when we were there. For example we were just about to head out and noticed that it was lightly raining – the bellman told us to hold one a minute and came back with an umbrella for us to use for the day.

All the desk agents and restaurant employees speak English and are friendly. This is a Starwood affiliated hotel so you can  expect amenities of an American hotel (doorman, nice toiletries, turn down service, etc) with the charms of an European boutique.  But the real mvp is the breakfast. There is a buffet of Greek yogurts with all kinds of granola, dry fruits and nut toppings. There are also pastries, including the best chocolate croissant. You can also order eggs any style with a side of bacon or sausage.  The hotel is just a block away from Syntagma Square, so you can take public transit from the airport. It's…\n",

It's so convenient to get to from major sites, the design is fun and impressive, the rooms are very nice and comfortable with views and balconies. If you're a light sleeper you may be bothered by the street noise and lack of black-out shades on all windows. The rooftop bar/restaurant is perfect for a drink or dinner if you're tired of walking. There are also two wine bars within one block, and a little neighborhood eatery across from sideways with very nice and welcoming owners. The hotel staff will go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. It's a great boutique hotel. Small and personalized, just the way we like it.\n",

We also had a wonderful diner for my husband's birthday at the hotel's restaurant on the roof top with a view of the Acropolis (require reservation). The hotel's location is excellent  - walking distance to all major attractions in Athens. The only reason that I didn't give this hotel a five-star rating is because of the loud traffic that we could hear the whole first night in Rm#201. When I asked the front desk to switch to a quite room the next day, I was told that 201 was 'one of their quieter rooms'. Nonetheless, we were let to switch to 501 which is a much quiet room.\n",

It could be a design center for chairs...ha!  Rooftop restaurant has a view of the Parthenon.  It has a business center, spa, gym, and bar. If you're looking for a traditional large 2000-room hotel, look elsewhere. The hotel is compact, efficient, but fully-loaded, like a Mercedes SL 550. We were in a corner 3rd floor room so street noise is an issue during peak hours. The double-paned balcony doors cut down the noise significantly. And about the nice scent everywhere...it's like walking through a gentle shower with soap and water. Totally agreeable.\n",

The hotel is right in the center of town, a 15-minute walk to the Acropolis and other areas of historic interest, as well as streets full of cute shops and cafes.  My Studio room was spacious, with floor to ceiling windows that were effectively covered by a blackout curtain at night.  There was some street noise in my room, which was on an upper floor - Athenian drivers use their horns as often as their brakes - but it was honestly pretty faint, and I never heard any noise from the hall or any neighboring rooms.  The bed was very comfortable, the temperature easy to control, and the decor cute and quirky without feeling overly designed.  The only knock against it was that the moody lighting in the bathroom…\n",

It's also very close to Plaka - a popular area. We never once had to use a taxi or shuttle to get around (except one to the airport!). The hotel is super cool and funky. Different artists/designers did the rooms so each one has its own theme/flair. Our room was on the 5th floor on the corner which offered not only breathtaking views but two balconies! The staff was very friendly and willing to help with anything we needed. Also, the breakfast is great - buffet style with your choice of eggs.

Anyhow, the New Hotel is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at in a long time. Yeah, there are probably better ones, but those are true \"5-Star\" hotels, with a price to match that status. The staff was friendly and efficient. The rooms were spacious and smartly designed. The big bed and effective shower were a welcome relief after a week in a small inn on the Peloponnese. The breakfast was varied and tasty. The rooftop lounge and restaurant was also quite nice.  Excellent location! It's a 5-minute walk to the Metro, and less than…\n",

Athens Greece is very hot, the air condition kept our room by choice like a refrigerator.  The breakfast was a typical European breakfast, with breakfast meats, bread, pastries and fruit. You also had a choice of eggs anyway you like them with sausage or bacon. If you're not satisfied with that there are many breakfast cafés in the area-walking distance.

The beds were really comfortable and there was a nice terrace overlooking part of Athens. Breakfast was also good - loads to choose from and all good quality. The best part though was the roof terrace which felt so relaxing and trendy - good music, great design and great views! We had a drink here after eating in Plaka.

Not far from the parliament building, temple of Zeus or the Acropolis.   The bed was one of the more comfortable on our trip. Breakfast is well done: great buffet but also some a la carte options to supplement. The rooftop restaurant has very nice views and good food.   The best part on the front end of our stay was the shower. It was a double with very relaxing rain heads, completely marble on all sides but the door. Really a nice tough.\n",

Moreover, one of us had a little accident and the concierge organized a good dentist, on a Sunday, in a few minutes.  Young, robust, very consistent hotel.

The products in the bathroom are great and they have great water pressure. You really can't beat the location of this hotel just a few minutes walk from Syntagma and Monistiraki. My only slight complaint is the staff on the rooftop bar, which has a totally amazing view of the acropolis, was not really great. They were not reactive and slightly rude. Other than that small annoyance the rest of the staff was amazing and very helpful. I definitely recommend this for your stay in Athens.\n",

What I can tell you is depending upon what you plan to use it for, it may work.  For us, we stopped over and used it's amenities to work out and print our boarding passes.  In regard to our rooms, they were small with strange bathrooms that weren't roomy at all.  The hotel itself had a strange odor and the staff was friendly but pushed for tips and suggested horrible restaurants (my assumption is they got some sort of kickback).  They offered complimentary breakfast which was average...the best thing on the menu being the Greek Yogurt.  I ate that by the BOWL.   Overall, it's a decent place for the price, but I won't be back.\n",

We took a 4 hour walking tour as well to get to know more about the city and its history.  The food and view at the rooftop resort is also very good.

The hotel staff was extremely accommodating, helping us check in and out as easily as possible with a smile on their faces. Our luggage was always taken care of (we even left our bags overnight while we went on a 2 day tour and they took excellent care of our belongings). We loved staying at the New.

(Actually, mine didn't work well the first night but it was fixed as soon as I let them know).  The drawbacks are no real business center (there are some computers available) and no concierge (the desk attendants give advice, but didn't seem as knowledgeable as a concierge should have been).  A real bar in the top-floor restaurant would also be nice.  Overall, though, it's a good value and a great location.  I'd stay there again.\n",

      "Review is :Our family of 4 with 2 young adult children stayed one night at New Hotel. It is a lovely, modern space with a great location just a couple of blocks from Syntagma Square. We had connecting rooms which were very well appointed and very comfortable. I arranged transportation to/from the hotel with the staff and it was punctual and reasonably priced. We were able to store our luggage until our departure which was very convenience and helpful. The breakfast buffet is very delicious and very varied-there is something for everyone. The hotel has a rooftop restaurant/bar which is lovely and provided a great view of the Acropolis and the city. We enjoyed having drinks/coffee here 2 times. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would definitely stay here again!\n",

      "Review is :New Hotel is perfectly located in the city center of Athens, with walking distance to the most popular shopping and tourist district Plaka, and to the world renown Acropolis ancient monuments. We stayed on the highest floor which gave us a gorgeous view especially during sunset, of the Acropolis on the hill. The hotel staff is super efficient and the bedroom is beautifully cozy and spotlessly clean. Super strong and quick free WIFI is a plus to frequent travelers like us. Breakfast was included in our booking and the staff at the restaurant is always friendly and helpful. The staff at reception desk was especially helpful when they booked a taxi for us to the airport, and assisted in our communication with the local travel agency about our itinerary change of the one-day cruise…\n",

The design of the hotel is Danish modern with very unique décor throughout.   The walls in the lobby and dining room are constructed from discarded furniture pieces, cleverly hung together.   Chairs are upholstered with large, gathered pieces of leather.   There is a bar/restaurant on the top floor with both inside and outside seating.   It offers a nice view of an old church and the Acropolis.  The rooms also are designed with interesting wall murals, and the bedding is very comfortable.   The bathroom is situated in such a way that the door to the room also serves as the shower door!   All the amenities are included: …\n",

The receptionists and concierges could not have been more helpful and they reassured us that we were in good hands. Our room had a gorgeous sitting area, balcony and brilliantly designed bathroom. It was, however, noisy and too light to sleep brilliantly - perhaps the rooms facing east are quieter.   The location is perfect; 15 mins to the Acropolis, the Agora, 10 mins from Plaka, where there are lots of cool bars, cafes and restaurants.   Even minutes' walks away there are great wine bars, bistros and coffee shops.   The only slight drawback in our entire stay was that the New Hotel is expensive and for that I would have liked an iron and a kettle at least…\n",

I was relying on my taxi cab driver to help me find a last minute hotel room, and after seeing one location, of which I was not fond, he brought me to the New Hotel.  I couldn't have found a better place, even if I had tried to plan months in advance.  As soon as the cab pulled up, the bellhop was greeting me with a huge smile and perfect English.  He was quick to scoop up my luggage, bring it inside, and hand me a glass of mineral water.  Maybe this is how everyone expects to be welcomed when they travel, but this has not been my general experience, and it was a sign of the care and hospitality that would be extended to me throughout my stay.

Nicely appointed, lovely chocolates at turn-down, locally produced boutique Greek toiletries and soaps, and while views from window weren't that great, the location walking distance to the Acropolis, metro, bus and taxis as well as Plaka and Syntagma Square make this a great place to stay.\n",

The best things about this hotel are its trendiness and location.  it is five minutes' walk from Syntagma Square in one direction and ten minutes from Plaka in another.  Everything from the chairs to the mirrors has been specifically designed and themed - one of our rooms had enlarged framed postcards scattered across the wall, the other had classic Greek eye designs.  Mirrors with odd angles, and walls or pillars covered in wooden bric-a-brac were themes throughout.

I definitely recommend New Taste restaurant for both breakfast and dinner (Try apple pie for breakfast. Simply amazing!)

Overall, my stay was memorable and I will definitely choose again New hotel the next time I’ll visit the center of Athens.\n",

The design is wonderfully done and fit for any city-loving, art hound.  Rooms are not enormous but not tiny either. I'd call them intimate and comfortable. There are balconies scattered here and there in the rooms that give you fun lookouts onto Athens below.  While you're there, take advantage of the charming roof terrace with its delicious drinks and food and a peek at the Acropolis just behind.

Just keep being friendly and, like everyone we met in Greece, they become very friendly in turn.  We dined at their restaurant “New Art Lounge” and the food was excellent and reasonable.  We had glass wines to try the different Greek offerings and they were all delicious.  Breakfast is really nice, although their coffee is pretty awful.

Shower system (fake gold shower and taps)  has lost its gold coating looking decidedly shabby. The glass shower doors leaked water on to the wooden flooring next to shower , thus damaging the flooring, (another design failure).

I was in touch with concierge service during the time leading up to our visit, and they responded promptly and were quite helpful.  Highly recommend.\n",

Although the room was small, it was very nice.  Our first room had a little balcony that we enjoyed sitting on after a day of walking and going through museums.The staff spoke English very well (I only mention it because when we were in Spain, they didn't) and was always accommodating and friendly.  On our first part of the trip we had used American Airline miles for the room, and it didn't include breakfast.  There were plenty of little pasty shops near by to pick up an inexpensive breakfast. The 2nd part of the trip we paid for breakfast, and it was excellent- the best of the 3 other locations on our trip.  Another great…\n",

      "Review is :Was there at New Hotel Athens last month. The first thing and most important for any Tourist is location of the hotel, and New Hotel scores full marks for that. Rooms are small but that would be the case of most centrally located hotels in most European Cities. Rooms have a New and Modern feeling. Striking feature is Art Work in and around the hotel / rooms, good use of spaces (sorry for some reason have missed those pictures). Hotels has two lovely restaurants one on the ground floor and one on the roof top. Food is awesome, or maybe being a foody I am biased. The Hotel staff each one of them very warm and friendly. All in all good Hotel, good location and excellent staff.\n",

That said, it is on a very busy street and there is a grittiness to the immediate area. However, the great thing about this hotel (which took me a day to realize) is if you turn left when exiting and go down the side street, as opposed to keeping to the main street out front, you will quickly find yourself immersed in a relatively quiet neighborhood with cobblestone streets. And, with a brisk 5 to 7 minute walk, you will find yourself in the heart of the Plaka. Once I discovered these residential side streets, and how to navigate the neighborhood away from busy roads, I enjoyed my stay much more. The New Hotel is very well…\n",

I’ll deal with the hotel itself later in this review. One month after our return to England this has now been credited but not before a very stressful, embarrassing and much wasted time in Athens. In part this was because of a failure in the New Hotel management but equally to blame was the central ‘Mr and Mrs Smith’ hotel group admin (apparently based in New York and Santa Monica from the email traffic) who had failed to inform Athens of our wish to use this voucher. They knew about it very well in advance. One of the New Hotel reception staff didn’t know how to deal…\n",

The breakfast spread is excellent, and it has an espresso bar which produces coffee which will satisfy even discerning Aussies!  The roof top bar has beautiful views over Athens from St George to the Acropolis.  We had a very enjoyable lunch up there. Staff very helpful and friendly.\n",

      "Review is :Great location - close to the centre of city but also close enough to be a blue to walk to the Acropolis and similar locations.   Superb breakfast.  Pleasant rooms. Very good rooftop dining / bar area. Did not really try any of the other hotel facilities part form using the business centres seating area to do some work after checkout.   Only thing I might say is we found the shower water tended to spill onto the flora a lot but this was ok once we accepted it as inevitable. Wifi was generally good but a bit flaky - hard to maintain a Skype call. Based on my internet experience the down speeds were ok but the up speeds were deficient.  Well worth inclusion on your list of possibles.\n",

Excellent service and great breakfast - I have eaten very few croissants as good and buttery as New Hotel's, for real:)   No five stars because at the breakfast dinning room the woman with long black hair is so snotty that the whole enjoyment of the experience is diminished; why do some people believe that being \"classy\" and \"sophisticated\" is to be equated with an obnoxious attitude? I am a firm believer that people should do what they are good at, and if you are not a people person, do not work in a job that requires finesse and graciousness - nope, she was the only and major complaint!\n",

Not decorated like most hotels, but it was fresh and clean and really easy to live in. I really enjoyed my stay, and felt very much at home. The hotel staff are outstanding, and there is a lovely bar/lounge area on the rooftop with the most wonderful views and pleasant atmosphere. The location is also great, the Plaka is just around the corner, so ther is access to great shopping and eating. All in all, great Hotel, great location and great staff. Very comfortable.

Check-in is very informal, with highly professional hosts sitting at desks in the lobby. They couldn’t have been nicer as we contemplated switching rooms for different bed sizes. The lobby also features incredible floor-to-ceiling wood sculptures. The décor throughout is modern and fun. We especially liked how each of our rooms had a different Greek theme. As others have noted, the breakfast is sumptuous with an incredible array of fruits, pastries, Greek specialties, cereals, etc. The hotel is also very centrally located a short walk to the Acropolis, Parliament, National Garden, etc. If you stay, then…\n",

By European standards I would consider the size of the room standard plus. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was very impressive. They have cook to order eggs and a great buffet spread. The location is the cherry on top, it is extremely central to all of the sights and attractions. I think we passed it 2-3x during our half day tour. Definitely recommend!\n",

The location is perfect and is within close walking distance to Plaka, the Acropolis, and many other attractions. The rooms vary quite a bit, so be sure to specify if you would like a certain theme - the evil eyes on the wall are my favorite, they are back lit and give off a soft glow at night! A few rooms have a view of the Acropolis, which can be seen from a narrow balcony outside the room, but the best view is from the new art lounge upstairs - don't miss it if you want to enjoy a drink. On our most recent trip we had dinner upstairs as well and were pleasantly surprised! They have Greek items as well as a few non-Greek dishes.

The hall and the rooms were completely renewed recently, and the interior designer used furniture and lighting of the old hotel to decorated the new one, with a very refined and stylish effect. A dinner or just a cocktail on the roof garden is mandatory. It features a partial view of the Parthenon and a full view of Lycabettus Hill. We were surprised by the very high prices of 2 cappuccino and 2 espresso (we did not have breakfast included in our accomodation). It was almost crazy (approx 30 euro, including taxes). Beside the bad experience of the breakfast (we found very nice bar in the streets nearby in the following days), my opinion on this hotel is very good.  The hall has a very nice \"hotel scent\",…\n",

The view from the roof top restaurant is stunning.  The staff was great and the location near the plaka (pedestrian area of Athens) and just below the Acropolis was perfect.

The location was excellent, walking distance to Syntagma Square, Monastiraki flea market and popular shopping along Ermou street (Mango, H&M, S.Oliver). We are in our late 20's and we wanted somewhere cool, funky, not too touristy. New Hotel exceeded our expectations. Once we arrived, we were greeted and welcomed with friendly service. Thank you to the wonderful staff! We felt that they are genuinely interested in making our stay the best that it can be (that is to say, it's not just a job!).

      "Review is :When you enter this hotel for the first time, it can be disturbing. I live in Poland and there is a place there called Czarna Gora in Czestachowa where Catholic fundamentalists go to display bizarre devotional rituals. The walls of the chapel are covered with crutches, leg casts, rosary beads and other disturbing devotional offerings, placed there by no doubt genuine, but very disturbed and misguided, religious extremists. The walls of the foyer of the New Hotel reminded me of Czarna Gora chapel, with the walls covered by bizzare wooden \"objets d'art\". So in general the hotel is over-designed, but despite this, very good. The New Hotel is a boutique hotel in the centre of Athens and close to Syntagma Square and Plaka (if you're into souvlaki and mass tourism). The hotel has very…\n",

Despite turning the thermostat as low as it would go, the room *never* cooled off, even while running full blast all evening.  Finally, this is yet another hotel that tries to guilt you into reusing your towels.  Look, I'm happy to help you cut costs and reuse my towel, but please give all the \"help us save the earth\" business a rest.\n",

We booked a studio room which was a corner room with a balcony. Bright and airy. Roof top restaurant with great food and wine list and a friendly staff. Everything we wanted.   The only issue was the front desk staff could have communicated better. They recommended a restaurant with a view of the Acropolis and booked it for us. They gave us incomplete directions and when we arrived the owner said they told them they were fully booked.   Since that was the only thing that went wrong I would recommend this hotel.\n",

The room was large, clean, modern, nicely appointed, and had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on!  The rooftop bar has a great view of the city with a sneaky view of the Acropolis, tucked around a corner.  My only complaint was street noise - Athens doesn't sleep and the hotel sits on a major road, so we could hear cars throughout the night.  Despite that, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great Athens stay!\n",

The staff really goes above board to make sure you feel taken care off with information and the concierges really have all the connections even when you want a private car to Delphi.  It is centrally located so you are close to the city center but far enough away to not be directly in the hustle and bustle of tourist row.  We had a suite and was delightfully surprised at the size of the suite for the price and being in the old city that we were in.

      "Review is :Lovely boutique design style hotel in a great location in Plaka. I spent a reasonable amount of time looking for the right hotel in Athens, I narrowed it down to Syntagma Sq vs Monastiraki Sq. The New Hotel, is in a nice upmarket part of Plaka, with a lovely cobbled streets with shops and restaurants leading to the Acropolis (5-10min walk)   Pros  Rooms – go for the Plus room with a balcony, natural light. Bright, airy and clean. Views of the church (on the Filellinon) or the side street, just as good. Go for a higher floor – I had floor 6 – so no noise what so ever. Don’t worry about view of the Acropolis – as its too far to get a good view. Location – upmarket clean area, close to Acroplis and Temple of Zeus/Hadrians Arch is 5min walk. Monastiraki Sq is 10min walk. 5min walk…\n",

The room itself was a unique arrangement, including two useable decks (note, corner rooms can be a bit loud, even at night), very comfortable beds and a spacious bathroom.

We were able to walk to the acropolis, acropolis museum, parliament building to see the changing of the guard, and shopping streets. I cannot speak to concierge service.

La Plaka, Syntagma square, the Acropolis are few minutes walking distance away. The rooms, though not too large, are comfortably furnished and every needed amenity is available neatly spread within the space. Breakfast is rich and delicious giving you an energetic day start. Last but not least, a hotel stay is never complete without the service of a team making sure you get everything you need from start to finish, and this is exactly what the New hotel staff provides graciously with smiling faces.

The bathroom door swiveled over to become the shower door which was the only odd part but I guess it's meant to save space. Our terrace was spacious and sunny and looked over the beautiful church across the street. Service was good. Elevators were shared with staff so there always a little bit of a wait.

On entering the lobby you are immediately confronted with an entire wall adorned with parts of cabinets, picture frames and table legs. This give you an idea of what's in store for the rest if your stay.  The entire hotel is very stylish and modern. Which we enjoyed, but if you were looking for something more homely, this might not suit. The staff, were both friendly and efficient.  The bar upstairs offers a view of the Acropolis, but only from part of the decking, so try and get a seat on the south side of it if you can.  The restaurant is very tasty, although slightly on the expensive side. Overall, an enjoyable stay, in a well located, modern hotel.\n",

Room was small but well appointed and clean. Design was awesome- very unique. Roof top bar was open but could not sit outside due to deck treatment. Food was awesome both for breakfast as well as tapas in the evening. Great location and close to the Acropolis. Would come again in a heartbeat if ever visiting Athens. They even packed us a breakfast when we had to check out early (before the restaurant opened) to catch a ferry to Mykonos! Thank you again, New Hotel!\n",

      "Review is :My husband and I spent 5 nights at the New Hotel in Athens during the first week of April, 2015.  We loved the hotel, which is stylish and very well located.  We were able to walk not only to the Acropolis, the Plaka and Kolonaki, but also to other fun neighborhoods like Keramikos and Gazi.  We arrived at noon and learned we could have lunch at the hotel’s rooftop restaurant, which has a wrap-around terrace that allowed us to eat outdoors with spectacular views of  Lycabettus Hill (in one direction) and the Acropolis (in the other).  The food was terrific – so we decided to eat dinner there that evening.  The meal was superb but people at adjacent tables were smoking even though we ate indoors.

We had booked a junior suite in order for the baby to have a separate room and for us to enjoy privacy. The main bedroom as well as the bathroom was absolutely luxurious and stylish providing high- end design, calm and serenity. The first room lacked this special feature of design boutique hotel.  What I really liked were the decorative figures of popular Greek Karaghiozis hung on the bedroom's main wall stating the hotel's greek identity.

I do not regret one penny. The view of the Parthenon from the rooftop terrace AND the bedroom was amazing. There is also a really cute balcony/terrace on the opposite side of the bedroom that makes you feel like you are in Old World Europe with its lattice and winding vines (it was like a vacation within a vacation).

This wasn't a quick enquiry however I think that was mostly due to the fact that the hotel was rather full.

In my opinion, the extra space in a Junior Suite could have been used for a bathtub and double basin.

We defintiely recommend the hotel for the start of your Greek Adventures. The only disappoint, was the room service let a bit to be desired.

Only problem was that the hotel wifi went down, DURING A PILOT STRIKE on Lufthansa.  So, without Wifi, we had to use the hotel phone and call the US to speak with an agent.  At the exorbitant hotel phone rates, we spent $600 to fix our flights.  The hotel management was nice enough to give us a 20% discount on our phone bill, but this didn't compensate for the fact that the WiFi would have been sufficient to use Skype or other phone services...but the WiFi didn't work.  So, I'm giving this property 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt like the phone call should have been free... not $500.  Ouch.... this will go down as the most expensive call of my entire…\n",

It is reachable by metro & bus from the airport, which is much more convenient than by taxi (they charged us 10 times more in taxi than the bus ticket). Just calling the cab is 3 EURO in Athens, so u can just walk to Syntagma & pick one from there.  Great wine bar just across the street (By Glass) for a nice drink & snack in late in the night.\n",

The room is well appointed, with a novel decor depicting photos from 'old' Athens and ours was overlooking the Russian Orthodox Church.  Understanding how the TV worked was a little complicated.  Room was serviced twice a day.  Breakfast was excellent with fresh juice and freshly made bakeries - with hot dudes cooked to order.

All the main attractions are on New Hotel's doorstep making it ideal for the sights.

The New Hotel is in the heart of Athens and makes for a great point to see explore most of the points of interest. The New Hotel beckons modernism combined with an artistic taste.

With pieces of wood carefully decorating the walls, lanterns strung along the window and bright colors, you can feel the fun atmosphere. This hotel carries a young but refined atmosphere to it.

We had dinner upstairs - delicious and wonderful views - you can see the Acropolis from the outside seating area.  We ate at the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and thought it was great.  There are many selections and different price points that should make everyone happy.  The hotel decor is very modern but warm and inviting and they have bottled water and the most delicious chocolate and almond delights and fruit available in the lobby.  The employee staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was very clean…\n",

I got a superior room on the second floor on the side road which was comfortable with unique decorations.  I requested a \"quiet room\", but it was still quite noisy.  The rooms on the main road would be worse.  Lots of light switches which is confusing.  Breakfast was included in the rate.  It had a good selection of cereals, pastries and fruit.  Juice was limited to orange, but that was ok for me.  Very attentive service during breakfast.  The single small lift caused a wait occasionally, but not the worst I have seen in hotels.   Excellent servicing of room and turn down service, which was both discrete and efficient.  The room was very clean and well maintained. …\n",

The hotel was just 5 mins walk to the plaka area (the old town) and another 10 mins walk to the Acropolis area whereby there are many restaurants nearby with a view overseeing the Parthenon. It was also just 10 mins walk to the Syntagma Square where most of the shopping can be done.  The fare from the airport to the hotel was a flat 35 euros and it was really easy for us to get into a cab at the airport.   The hotel staff were all friendly and provided excellent service. Hotel guests would be invited to enjoy a complimentary cocktail on the rooftop bar (only one portion of it has the view of the Parthenon). My compliments to the hotel reception, concierge and the roof top bar crew…\n",

The hotel is small, lobby is small but nice, the restaurant is very nice, and the rooms are about what one expects in Europe (a bit on the small side for us Yanks).  The rooms are very well done with nice fixtures, and the WiFi worked well. All service was great, front desk, restaurant wait-staff, I arranged a car with them, great, my Dad left his passport, they plucked it out of the safe and worked to get it to him. Location is perfect, walk down Nikodimeou Street to the Plaka, and a few blocks past that, to the Acropolis.  We experienced no protests in Athens, but if there are going to some, they'll be just down the street, which may cause some congestion. No hesitation to recommend fully.\n",

Our room was at the back of the hotel and on a high floor and there was no traffic noise whatsoever. Again the bathroom was a little unusual but very functional but perhaps it would be an idea if the shower door also opened inwards to stop all the dripping on the floor - that is about the only negative comment I can find.

The staff are friendly and very nice and were very helpful in offering advice on where to go and what to see.  The hotel room itself was interesting and really probably the most unique hotel room I've ever been in. Only some points to bring up: it was tough to figure out which light was for what. Along with that it was difficult to use the mirror above the sink bc the light was so dim. I also don't know if this was just our room, but the water never really got hot in the shower, it was warm enough but not hot.  Overall these are small points, I liked the room, location, and very friendly staff and I'd stay here again if I returned to Athens.\n",

Easy walk to Acropolis and Hadrian's Gate right next door.   The rooms are unique and quirky. Your mileage may vary.  The staff was comfortable in about any language, and gave us great recommendations for meals. And the chocolates in the lobby were a nice touch!  And the rooftop bar and staff were great!

First, I must way that it is in a very good location and breakfast, which was included with the room, is quite good.

We had two twin beds pushed together in the middle of the room - with about 18\" on each side.  Other than the beds and a built in desk area, there was no furniture - there would have been no room.

Our room was large, a great bed and lounge, a balcony, although small had a view of the Acropolis! The shower/toilet set up was a bit unusual with a door used for both. The timber walls in the shower area have already showed damage from water which is a shame. The staff, especially the girls at reception were very pleasant and helpful.

      "Review is :We had a great time at this hotel.  The staff were absolutely wonderful and the hotel was designed with an attention to detail rather than just simply put together like most hotels.  We actually booked the penthouse by mistake because I mixed up the reservation and came the day we were supposed to check out.  The hotel was full and all they had was the penthouse.  Not wanting to schlepp our bags around the streets and find other accommodation, we decided to take the penthouse.  Upon showing us the penthouse, we immediately agreed to take it and it turned out to be a wonderful mistake!   It was very spacious for the four of us but the best part was the massive deck and the bed on the deck!  The view was incredible because you could see all over the city and the Acropolis was…\n",

      "Review is :My wife and I (both 27) went here on the last leg of our honeymoon, and couldn't have picked a better spot, in a better location, in Athens.   The cab to the hotel from the airport was around 50 euro (a bit cheaper before midnight, but we arrived late). I contacted the hotel to arrange for a cab from the hotel to pick us up, and was quickly responded to within 20 mins, and also had the fare charged to our room.  Must more convenient!  The hotel, although looks old like many of the buildings on the outside, is pretty incredible when you get inside.  The decor is like nothing you've seen before.  Checkin was a breeze and the people at the front were very helpful in pointing us in the right direction.  Our room was also incredible.  Very cool and swanky decor and when you open the…\n",

Bottom line: the best location to stay at in Athens  Service: 4-5 star. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, all the staff were attentive with arranging our luggages, greeted us with smiles, expedited check-in process with no wait, and very informative front desk (gave us maps and overview of area). All this was much needed after a long overnight flight from NYC.   Room: small but modern, very clean, and artistically decorated.

I’d contacted to hotel ahead of our visit and asked if they could recommend a Spanish-speaking tour guide.

One could quibble with the design scheme (old leather, cloth and furniture was reused in fragments throughout the hotel) but the overall effect is something one adjusts to.  The front desk was really helpful with evening events, and really nice.  Breakfast options are numerous and yummy.  Top floor has pleasant area for pricy drinks, and views of Lykavittos hill.  Nice gym, too, for a hotel.  Junior suite has ample room, separate toilet, wash basin and shower.  Lights are controlled at bedside, which can be clumsy in the middle of the night.

      "Review is :Was quite disappointed when we got into our rooms. 1 junior suite, 1 superior & 1 standard. Can tell they tried very hard to create a theme but not it's not going too well with our taste... the toilet and shower shares the same door in 90 degree angle, and it's very awkward to use it and the toilet become wet after using.  The lighting is also hopeless, I can't see myself clearly in all the mirror in the room. And the reflexion from the GOLDEN sink blinds me every single time I goes to the toilet... That is very annoying!  The roof bar is nice and relaxing, view was not as spectacular as I expected though...  However they do have nice and friendly staff... And location is close to Plaka tourist area and walking distance to all the major attraction.   Won't recommend to stay…\n",

Our room had interesting decor and a really comfortable bed. Probably the only complaint was that there were so many light switches that we never quite figured them out. We liked the electronic blind on the front windows which completely blocked the light. The breakfast is excellent and the public areas have interesting features and mood music. Probably the best feature however is the rooftop bar and restaurant, which has views to the Acropolis (from the tables on the right side verandahs) and Lycabettus Hill on the other side. It is a great place for a drink or coffee and you can also eat there. Don't stay here if you are looking for a traditional…\n",

The location of the hotel was prime, walking distance from ancient sites, plaka, restaurants etc.  The rooftop restaurant had a great view, but was SUPER overpriced... I'm talking $20 martini's.  Because of the outrageous prices, we didn't stay at our hotel to eat/drink, but we could EASILY find great restaruants and bars for reasonable prices in the area.

The service sets them apart, from the cheerful doorman to the concierge. My son left his passport in his room, which we discovered only while in the security line at the airport.

The fuzzy astroturf type \"lawn\" in the breakfast room was kind of a turnoff - how much food catches in there, who knows.  We felt like they are trying too hard to be \"hip\" to be \"cool\" and have forgotten that comfort can always be interjected to make travelers feel welcome.

I’m totally in favor of smaller hotels and the individual service they can provide. My room was comfortable,nicely designed, and had everything I needed and then some. It was quiet, and there was a charging station for my iPhone that played my music. The location is within walking distance of many Athens destinations, and right next to the Syntagma Square metro station. It was so easy to get there by train from Piraeus, and equally easy to take the train to the airport. I could not have made a better choice.\n",

      "Review is :We chose this hotel due to its location and design. Most hotels in Athens look a bit outdated so the New Hotel stood out to us as modern and fresh. Its location is perfect, within walking distance to all the major sights. We walked everywhere (Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Syntagma Square, Ancient Agora, Monastiraki) and only took the cab from and to the airport. The cabs cost 35 Euro to the hotel.  We booked the Standard Room for two nights at 200 Euro a night. The decor was nothing to shout about - postcards on the walls which actually looked a bit messy to me. The biggest dislike I had about the room was the design and condition of the bathroom. I understand that it is a design hotel but designs should also be practical and the bathroom layout was not. The shower door doubles…\n",

The rooms were perfect: comfy bed, air conditioning that works, and a nice modern bathroom.  There was some mood lighting behind the art work, which was kind of cool.  The breakfast was fine, and the staff were courteous and efficient.   I had the awesome benefit of watching a couple have a full blown nuclear meltdown while checking out, so it gets high marks for people watching points.    The manager handled it really well, by the way, so more points for professionalism under fire.     The Plaka area is maybe 300 meters away, and you'll have a ton of eating options.   The Acropolis is also within ten minutes walking range, and it you are a bit adventuresome then…\n",

Our room wasnt ready when we arrived at 12 so they gave us complimentary drinks in the rooftop restaurant lounge; the place was great; I mean they really invested in the refurbishment here; although it was 30+ degrees outside; the inside was perfect and with panoramic 180 degree view; I could also notice they recycled a lot of materials in the refurbishment.  The room was a little small but well designed and well decorated. The breakfast is really worth it; great bread, everything fresh, sometimes you think as a tourist that its better to go out and find something local, in this hotel take the breakfast.\n",

The hotel is really perfectly located to many areas of interest. A room with a balcony is suggested and a junior sweet is perfect space for two with large luggage. The bathroom is adequate with a big shower however the organic material use in it's design are quickly deteriorating and visible traces of mold all along the lower wall.  Why would one use Bamboo without proper sealing in such a context?   Compared to an older more traditional property like Grande Bretagne this is the property for design enthusiasts and the like.  cheers and thank you for the nice service\n",

Despite the budget my hubby and I set for hotel stay, we still went with it because we love boutique hotels and the location was considered quite central. I fell sick during the long journey to Greece (from Singapore).. but I was glad that I chose a great hotel to stay! It was so beautifully designed and the bedding were very comfy! Spent my first day just resting in the room and only went out for sight-seeing on the 2nd day. Only one thing that I feel they should improve on was the service.. Check-in took a while, and we had to go to the hotel's restaurant for lunch while waiting. Food was good though  :)\n",

There's an authenticity in how one is welcomed by the doorman from the curb into the hotel lobby and how the front desk staff assists from check-in to any type of requests and questions.  My one complaint is that the commode/shower (no bath) is over-thought and over-designed with the adjacent sink area not behind a closed door - it's open to the entry area of the room.  It works, but it's not ideal for guests (even married guests) who desire more privacy or quiet when the other person is sleeping.  Athens is a noisy city due to traffic.  One complaint is that the sliding doors (with great terrace access) aren't the most up-to-date when it comes to sound-proofing.  I'd…\n",

We walked to Acropolis, Plaka, Monastiraki, Temple of Zeus, Parliment, etc. If we go back to Athens, there is no question where we will stay!  Thank you New Hotel!\n",

The designers had cut up the old wooden furniture and used it to cover the walls - sounds odd but it worked.  Both bedrooms had displays on the walls - cut-outs of cartoon and mythical people in the first and 'evil eyes' in the second By US standards the rooms were not large but were designed that they did not feel small.  We had sufficient room for three medium sized cases and our hand luggage. The staff were really helpful and advised and booked us restaurants whenever we needed them.  There was no pressure to eat at the hotel.  We did eat there one evening with a view over the Acropolis at sunset. The food was good, although pricy. …\n",

Our first stop after our 26 hour flight from Sydney, Australia was the rooftop bar, which assuaged exhausted bodies with Greek tipple and an easy breezy view of the city and acropolois, lovely! We stayed in #402 which was well sized, no real view but away from the quaint historic Greek church located next door that chimes out booming bell tolls from 6.45am onwards! Nothing for us to worry about as, with jet lag and getting accustomed to the time difference, was no real issue for us. But local or EU brethren may find a tad disruptive to a nice holiday sleep in... All in all a great boutique hotel located a hop, skip and a jump away from Plaka restaurants, bars and shops and a 10 min walk to the Acropolis.\n",

There is nightly turn down service, which is nice, and again, I can't say enough good things about the staff.  The hotel has a very modern design, which is interesting, but that also means that some of the sinks are very loud when the faucet is turned on, and the design of the toilets is such that they are very loud when they are flushed. The toilet area (at least in 514) is only concealed by frosted glass, so not exactly the most private area.

The hotel was very comfortable and well designed with some quirky design elements which I enjoy. The room we had was a Jr Suite and it was large and very comfortable. We were greeted in the room with a nice card congratulating us on the marriage along with a plate of strawberries, chocolate and nuts and honey. Very sweet touch.

The whole concept behind this hotel is intriguing and well executed. From the moment we pulled up to the front door the service was some excellent without being over the top. We were treated with respect, courtesy, great refreshments, and staff who took actions instead of just lip service.   Our room was postcard themed with a great ambiance, comfortable bed, and refreshing Apivita toiletries. Had we not been walking all through Plaka we would have taken advantage of the balcony. The morning of our departure was before breakfast so they packed a quick to-go bag for us. Thank you. The only negatives we could say were minor due to noise from the busy…\n",

I'm going to give this review four stars  since I think some very important things were excellent: The location, the staff, the comfortable bed, and the delicious food at breakfast. But, as you have probably read by the previous reviews, this thotel has a fairly modern edgy design and has made an attempt to pay some respect to the previous hotel at this location. This is a really cool idea, and I applaud their efforts. However, after living in a guest room for 4 nights, I've come to the conclusion that this should have been kept to the common areas-rather than in the guestrooms.   We had a Junior suite, which was a…\n",

The roof top terrace is also great. However, the rooms suffer from some many unfortunate design flaws including lack of closet space and an impractical bathroom. For those reasons, I would not recommend or return. If you do decide to book there, make sure you ask for an upper floor room away from the traffic. The first night we stayed there, we were in room 104 and did not sleep at all because of the very loud traffic noises.\n",

The theme of the hotel is recycled furniture  with  a difference, sounds awful but it works, and the wood through out the building gives warmth.

The concierge was also very helpful in setting up dinner reservations and a private tour. The private tour was 3 hours with an amazing guide (Betty - ask for her, she is FANTASTIC!) and was reasonably priced and tailored to exactly what we wanted to see.  The location is great, close and walkable to everything. The room was quite nice and the bed was crazy comfortable! We had the studio sized room and it was very spacious.

As for the room, the bed was amazing - one of the best beds (and the sheets were fantastic!) we've slept in. Very comfortable pillows as well! The only minor let down was that the room was a little small and cramped - we were on a 6 week vacation and had 2 large luggages with us that barely fit in the room!

In many respects, I was not disappointed -- there are lots of very clever design elements to the public spaces and the rooms.  Location is great, bed was incredibly comfortable, balcony was very nice and the included breakfast was very good.   But in the end, there were a few design decisions that proved unfortunate and would make me think twice before going back.  First, there is no storage space immediately adjacent to the pedestal sink other than the ledge around the sink itself.  Yes, the sink and its stand is funky and interesting, but it certainly was possible to do something fun while including a little storage for toiletries.    Second, because the sink is in the…\n",

The complementary breakfast buffet is great as well. We loved the scrolling message board in the restaurant with bizarre messages (Obey the warlocks....etc).

Only negative was that a private party booked the rooftop bar for a meeting for several hours when we wanted to go up to see the view and have a drink. Besides that, everything was great.\n",

The concierge consistently made good restaurant recommendations and really listened to what we were looking for. The rooms are a bit small but really well designed so they don't feel cramped. Bed is comfortable and the double headed shower was great. Another plus was its location. The hotel was about a 15 minute walk from anything we wanted to see, and about two blocks from the metro to the airport. Highly recommended!\n",

The room was so beautiful with everything you could want there with an individual touch such as a personal welcome on the screen in the room. Balcony with views over Athens and the bar on the roof was perfect after a day sightseeing.  Breakfast was incredible with such a high level of service in such a magnificent room. Fold down service at night and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Centrally located and you can walk to all the sights.\n",

Reception staff were very helpful with our various arrangements and provided good advice re laudromats, restaurants etc.  Breakfast buffet is very good with ample variety to choose from.

The cheerful staff always responded positively to our requests, and we ended up having quite a few dinners on the rooftop bar during our one-week stay. Good selection of wines there with great views of the city. We ended practically every day of walking and touring Athens and environs at the rooftop bar. The rooms were comfortably equipped and clean, with a big in-room safe. The hotel is close enough to Syntagma Square that most major sites and museums are within easy walking distance. A minor negative point is the proximity of the Russian Orthodox church next door with its loud periodic bell ringing, but these episodes are of short duration. I'm struggling…\n",

The staff were welcoming and accommodating with our questions and we enjoyed the small touches such as a bottle of water in the room and fresh mini baked goods in the lobby. The reason I have not rated it 5/5 is that I was a little disappointed with the bathroom in our room - it was dark and had a damp smell about it after the shower was used. Not enough to request to move rooms as we only stayed one night. The balcony was a nice addition and as our room was on 6th floor had reasonable views over some of the city. We ate at the ArtLounge on the 7th floor, the food was  okay but, we felt, fell short of the menu descriptions. Breakfast was very good - home baked breads and pastries, homemade granola…\n",

It was a little on the small side, but I reckon that this room was actually quite big for a hotel in central Athens. It was stunning on the inside and out and the staff were fantastic.

The hotel also features floor to ceiling windows. The furniture too is designer and is unique.  In short, the design elements are Greek, and guess designed by whom, a Brazilian designer.   While the design is unique rest assured everything is functional.  The restaurant is quite famous in the area serving Mediterranean fare.

Who could have believe that the furniture from this hotel's previous existence could provide interesting sculptural decoration (check the pics)  The rooms are gorgeous -  look at the pic of the washbasin and the mass of 'evil eyes'  adorning one wall.   I love this place.   Finally,  excellent food,  wine and cigars in the roof terrace restaurant / cocktail bar ( which has even has a great view of the hills)   Love it!   Visit with…\n",

      "Review is :The New Hotel in Athens is a hotel that displays art in all the nooks and crannies of the entire venue.  The hotel’s international accommodation is one that will not be looked through by the guests.  They had gotten the best interior designers who conceptualized top of the line works of art.  The modern building reflects the modernity that Greece is embracing and offering.  The hotel also has 79 beautiful rooms to choose from and for sure guests will be enticed to stay longer than their planned stay.  The hotel has this aura that makes guests feel that they are truly being taken care of.  I love the interior and exterior of the hotel.\n",

      "Review is :For a hotel in a world capital, our room was decently sized, though in need of new furniture and carpeting.  However, it was clear that the management had recently invested heavily in the bathrooms.  Good.   We had a balcony that overlooked busy Amalias Ave., a major thoroughfare.            The Amalia is by no means lavish; its elevator is small and the lobby bar appears as a afterthought.   Nevertheless, every concierge, waiter, and bartender was attentive and helpful.              As in any great city, the value of this hotel to the traveler is in its location.  The Amalia lies in the Syntagma neighborhood, on Amalias Ave.  From the rooftop, one can see the glorious Acropolis in one direction and Mount Lycabattus in the opposite.             Across the street from the front door is the National Garden.  Definitely worth an afternoon of your time.  A few hundred yards up the road from the front door is the Parliament building in Syntagma Square, where you can watch the changing of the guard, a popular tourist attraction.  To the south of the hotel, at the foot of the Acropolis, lies Plaka, the oldest neighborhood in the city.  Plaka will remind you of Boston's North End or Geneva's Vieux Ville.  Plan to spend at least a full day walking Plaka's narrow streets and enjoying its shops and restaurants.              And of course, there are the antiquities.  Rest assured that the Parthenon, the Olympic Stadium, Hadrian's Arch and and all the rest are as awe-inspiring as you've been told.              If you want to drink in the life and history of Athens, accept this recommendation for the Amalia.  Decent property.  Very good value.  Excellent location.  …\n",

      "Review is :My partner and I stayed at the Amalia Hotel from 8/28 to 8/31 (4 nights).  GOOD- The hotel is perfectly situated in the center of the city across the street from the national gardens and across the street from the Parliament Building where the guards change every hour, very cool. You can easily walk to Plaka and other great areas to eat and shop.  It was very nice to walk around the hotel to find everything we were looking for including the tour buses, metro, light rail, etc. The lobby was nice. The front desk staff was friendly and always helpful. The breakfast was good.  It had a decent variety of things to choose from hot and cold.   The staff at the breakfast restaurant was very friendly and helpful. The rooftop of the hotel had spectacular views of the city both in the daytime and at night.  The view of the Acropolis was wonderful.    NOT SO GOOD- The room at first seemed to be clean.  Since COVID, we normally wipe down surfaces with disinfectant wipes that we brought with us.  The surfaces were extremely dirty with dust and dirt.  Even the frame around the bed was filthy.   The tables, the drawers, etc were all dirty.  The carpet had stains on it.  On a scale 1 to 10 (10 being the cleanest) I would rate the room a 5 for cleanliness.  The bed was hard but ok. The sheets seemed clean. There was NO iron in the room.  To iron, you have to go to a shared area of the hotel to share the iron which I thought was really strange.  We didn't bother and used our wrinkled clothes. The WORST part of the room was the TINY SHOWER.  It was so tiny that you could hardly move around to grab the soap or shampoo.  The water easily fell out onto the bathroom floor and the wet cloth shower curtain would cling onto your body as you showered which felt gross.  At the end of every shower, the bathroom floor would be soaked and wet no matter how carefully you were.  The shower is smaller than the ones you find in a cruise ship cabin.  It really was worse than the room NOT being properly cleaned.  We are very easy going people and just made the best of things since we were too exhausted after a very long flight to get to Greece to complain about it.    If this hotel would renovate & clean the rooms properly, and make the showers bigger, this hotel would be excellent.  It is truly in the best location in Athens and has many good things going for it otherwise.      I would have rated this hotel much higher if not for the room's short comings.    We really loved our first trip to Greece regardless of the issues I mentioned about the room. After we left AMALIA we flew to Mykonos and stayed at a great hotel.  I will write a separate review about that.  I hope this review help those who are on the fence about picking this hotel.…\n",

      "Review is :This should not be considered a 4 star hotel. When the travel agent recommended this hotel I did check reviews and they were glowing.... those people must not be spending much of anytime in the hotel rooms. While the lobby is very nice and does include a coffee shop and the location is great because so much is in walking distance,  but that's it for positives. Upon arrival the receptionist told us we had a wonderful view and a free bottle of wine waiting for us. There was no wine and the view was of a ran down apartment building. When trying to open the balcony door it was a struggle because the door was broken off the top latch. The room is very outdated, like a cheap hotel on the United States. The shower even had mold in the corners. The breakfast is a buffet and the food was over salted, very oily, and you can definitely tell they make it in large quantities and leave it sitting out.…\n",

The hotel staff was utterly fabulous. We arrived very early and they accommodated us. They easily stored our bags and called us when a room was ready. There was a restaurant on site which was again, great service and great food. We are vegan so they even accommodated us. There is a rooftop overlook which was gorgeous. You could see the changing of the guard in the distance. It also overlooks the gardens. Lastly, despite leaving at an early hour (4am), they packed a breakfast bag for us. I have never received such service.  The room was great. The mini bar prices were reasonable. This hotel was a complete find and I wished we could stay longer!…\n",

I was a bit tired and frustrated from my day of delays etc. This hotel was wonderful in greeting me, welcoming me and gave me a brilliant and comfortable room. I was amazed at the size, with balcony and lounge as well as two rooms.  I connected my phone to Netflix  and watched some films before taking a walk to the beach, very close by and with lovely restraints on hand. Nearby Glyfada is also a spot to visit with many bars and great things to do.   I was amazed to meet the local hotel dog who was gorgeous and the hotel have adopted him so kindly, for spending the day sunbathing at the front entrance.   The breakfast was great and the staff amazingly…\n",

They were wonderful. The breakfast was stunning.  If you want a cute adorable place in the Plaka, this isn't it. But ... if you are arriving in Athens from a long flight, you want something easily accessible to transportation. There was some modest traffic noise, so I played white noise on my smartphone. The breakfast was stunning.\n",

The hotel is 5 min walk to Ermou street, and the truth is the we did everything by walking because the location is wonderful! The hotel staff is super nice and kind, it began with Dora from from the reservation department and continued everywhere in the hotel -all the time we felt welcome! The   Greek people are amazing! it was my first time in the country and it was a great experience.  The Breakfast was good,although it was constant during our stay, but it didn't bother us. Choose this hotel. its a great decision.  Thank you Ms Meital Zofy…\n",

The personnel is striking friendly from the moment you set foot on the hotel. But i have to say this: Panagiotis and Odysseas at the reception are brilliant! I was faced with an unfortunate situation and both went out of their way to help me the best way possible. They did not have to, but they genuinely did! Well Done to these two and the rest of the team and management for  fostering this behavior.\n",

The staff was pleasant and very polite, and did strive to make things comfortable for the guests.

We chose Amalia as the price was reasonable (for three people) and it had good reviews, breakfast and location.  Good points: Staff are lovely! The welcome on reception was warm and delightful. Every time we came in after a day, we were greeted. The Porter, Stavros, was so kind and helpful too. He always said, ‘welcome back!’ My son loved this!  Breakfast was good.

Our room had everything we needed, HUGE bed (two double beds pushed together?), robe, slippers, coffee/tea making facilities, fridge/mini-bar, hairdryer (not great, but it works), safe, small size toiletries. Our room had a lovely view of the Acropolis, there is also a rooftop bar area with beautiful clear views of the Acropolis and the city. Great to go up there at night when everything is lit up.  The hotel staff are very friendly and accomodating, especially Julia on reception. A very nice lady.  We had a problem twice with our keys not working, easy fix. Breakfast is served from 6.30-10.30 every morning, there are a lot…\n",

Thank you for the upgrade to a deluxe suite which was very much appreciated but disappointed I was only staying one night and would have loved to have stayed  longer. The room was on the 6th floor on a corner of the building with enormous balcony on two sides with views of Parliament House and gardens. Spotlessly clean with robe, slippers and lovely toiletries The breakfast buffet was exceptional with great choices, all very fresh and plentiful This is an outstanding hotel and in the perfect position for getting around Athens and highly recommended.

We arrived to find our reservation had been cancelled due to the booking site we used going bust!!! This was nothing to do with The Amalia and entirely down to the travel agent. Never experienced anything like this before but I guess it’s a sign of the times we’re living in! By then The Amalia was fully booked but the staff at the front desk were just amazing! They phoned around and helped us find new accommodation which isn’t easy on marathon weekend!! So even though we didn’t stay, I’d still say this is a brilliant hotel based on such service from the staff, for people who weren’t even staying there!!

The service is still efficient and friendly and the room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was good as well, as far as breakfasts at hotels go, with enough options to choose from.

The rooms were relatively clean, good enough comfy beds and pillows. Has a very small Gym.   Our room included breakfast which was very basic not very fancy variety offered. Coffee and Tea were not good at all!   Amalia is located close to Palaka where you find many many restaurants of many cuisines, souvenir shops, supermarkets. If you are up to walking you can easily view the top of the Acropolis.

      "Review is :Stayed here on & off for two weeks (in between separate visits to other areas of Greece) and used it as a base to explore Athens.   It’s a large multi-floor hotel near Syntagma Square, which is one of the focal metro transport hubs of the city. It was 5 mins away from an area of restaurants and 10 mins from the centre of Plaka.   The hotel was very professionally run, spotlessly clean & functional. I had three separate rooms during my stay and all were near identical and extremely comfortable.   The self-service buffet breakfast was exceptional, with every possible option catered for.   I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Athens.\n",

The bathroom was quite small,but it was clean and the towels were good. The view from our room was fine, but the noise from traffic was rather loud, so windows could not be kept open. That was a pity. Breakfast was very good indeed! The staff was friendly, and we enjoyed our stay. It is a nice hotel. The National Garden is right across the street and is well worth visiting for its incredible collection of trees from all over the world.\n",

From there you can go straight into Plaka and visit most of archaeological sites, as well as other tourist attractions. For those, who are fit enough it is quite a short walk to the hillside of Acropolis. The checking in and out was fast and easy. The personnel is friendly. Rooms are clean. The house-keeping might last a while, but everything is being cleaned up and replenished, including small chocolates on the pillows. The breakfast is good (maybe not too much options for hot dishes as someone would like), with quite broad choices of snacks and fruits, and different kinds of coffee from coffee machine.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at this hotel in our last day in Greece. We regretted not having stayed here for all of our Athens part of the trip. The location is very good. Close to everything and the metro station. The rooms are very nice and clean. The breakfast was very good and it had a good variety. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The only negative thing is that they put two small beds together to make a king size (don't know if it's like that in other rooms but in ours it was). So when you sleep, you can feel the crack between the two beds if you go towards your partner. Also, we had a very nice view of the park, mountain and the main street... which on the second floor, could get a bit noisy at night because of the cars.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights in order to visit the Acropolis and it’s museum.  The hotel is very handy for the Metro at Syntagma, for the X bus to the airport, for Plaka, for Parliament, the Botanic Gardens etc.   The buffet breakfast is adequate. There is a small bar in the lobby. The view to the Acropolis arc from the roof is stunning, but although the roof is supplied with chairs and tables there is no bar - in face there isn’t even any light at night  - they are fitted, simply not switched on. They miss an opportunity to do something better here.  We had a classic room which was generally clean and comfortable, with a window overlooking what might have been an internal courtyard. Anyhow it wasn’t a room with a view. There was a safe, tv, gowns and coffee…\n",

Loved going up to the top floor for the views. Loved the powdered sugar candy at the entrance. There can be road noise and rowdy people noise being close to the square. I was disappointed that the hotel did not have a breakfast box offered for those who leave before breakfast is served.

In my opinion downmarket from a Holiday Inn where at least you know what you’re going to get. Motel style.  Poor service and menu options in the (small) cafe off the foyer. Understaffed and this very poor service. Don’t bother. Breakfast room better and choices here ok.   I guess it depends on what you like but next time I’ll book earlier, look for special deals, and stay in a hotel with a decent restaurant (Hotel Electra) where you can have a meal at night. A bit of ambience never goes astray...\n",

The hotel room was nice, the beds were a little hard but comfortable. My biggest con was the size of the bathroom and shower! The smallest bathroom I’ve EVER seen! You have to squeeze in just to close the bathroom door behind you and the shower only fits one person and super cramped. You literally wet the floor from showering. That’s how small it is.

My husband came out laughing about the attack of the killer shower curtain.  It was like cling wrap.  If your shoulder span is wider than 1 foot then you are in trouble.  There are also no power outlets in the bathrooms.  The beds were good.  It’s weird having separate beds  but at least they are pushed together.  Breakfast was good.  Not 4 star good but we did appreciate the variety and attention to detail. Our last day we had to leave before breakfast so they put out a nice tray of breads and coffee for us…\n",

The hotel is very central and within walking distance to the Acropolis, Plaka and all attractions and sight Athens has to offer. I would highly recommend staying at the Amalia hotel when visiting Athens.\n",

Had all the necessities the room needed except for a coffeemaker.  Complimentary buffet breakfast was good (and much appreciated!), had variety, and though the coffee makers they had was the automated push-button types and was watery, they did have the option for you to make a quick Greek coffee with ground coffee, a briki, whisk and hot water which I really enjoyed!  Best of all was the fantastic downtown location.  I was able to walk to all the archeological sites, the Plaka and museums from there without the need to take the Metro, taxi or buses.

This hotel is very clean, with great views, and an awesome location. You are not even a 7 minute walk from the Acropolis and on top of tons of shops and cafes. The hotel is right in front of a metro stop as well if you plan on getting around that way (we didn’t). The staff was very friendly and incredibly accommodating as they made us dinner reservations and called us cars when we needed them.  It also should be noted that an over the top continental breakfast came free of charge!\n",

And the free breakfast was the best we had the entire trip. Fantastic!    Cons: Stayed 3 nights: 2 in a Superior, 1 in a Classic. Pay more and upgrade or choose a different hotel. Of all the hotels we stayed at throughout 2 weeks in Greece, Amalias (3 cities) have the worst beds and showers. It’s time to change out the brick mattresses and offer a better rollaway option.\n",

At night you want it a bit cooler to sleep but try as we might we couldn't get it any cooler without opening the window.   One of the best features of this hotel is its proximity to the very centre of Athens which means a lot of external noise, hence you want the windows shut when trying to sleep.   Eventually after a few fitful nights we managed to work out that the A/C was actually directly heating the room despite the thermostat being set to 10c.

They had dials in the room for the aircon, but this was a gimmick and infact they only had central heating. The temperature felt like 28 degrees and every night we woke up with a sweat. Tried opening the window only to find that the city smelt like a bushfire, and it was better to suffocate in heat than to drown in smoke and freeze in 4 degrees. Also considered not turning on the central sauna system but the room smelt too dusty for comfort. Overall we had an unpleasant stay as we could not get a good nights sleep for the 4 nights we stayed there. Would not recommend this hotel\n",

Clean rooms and great breakfast.  Would definitely stay there again.  Quaint hotel with extremely small elevators!  They are glassed and look bigger than they are.  Beats walking up stairs with luggage :)\n",

It's close to the Metro, and you can walk to the Acropolis, to the meat market, the flea market, and tons of pubs and restaurants. All the facilites in the hotel are OK.

We were in Athens for the arathon, and the buses driving the runners from Athens to the start line in marathon started just in front of the hotel.  The only two bad points to be noted... they forgot that I booked the room with pre-payment ! Luckuly I had the proof with me so they couldn't charge me twice. The other thing is the airport shuttle : we paid 65 euros to come in (arranged by the hotel), and paid 38 while leaving (normal taxi driver that we met during our stay). It looks the taxi rate are fixed for the airport so, even if I can get that the hotrel needs to get a margin, I feel this one very big !\n",

Well, this hotel fit the bill for all of the above! It is directly across the street from the National Gardens (a beauty in itself) so getting back to the hotel from the finish just involved crossing through the gardens.

A walk in the botanical gardens across the road gives you interest and shade; go the other way and you're wandering in the Plaka on your way to the Acropolis very easily.  A room on the 6th floor gives you your own roof terrace and good space, and another high point is the breakfast, with extensive well presented and tasty options.

I was allocated a room on the 6th floor for only 2 nights yet was never warned that there would be a noisy party extending into the early hours of the morning with chairs and tables also being constantly dragged or moved around. I rang reception 5-6 times over the course of 3 hours and not until 2.30am did I notice the sound had reduced only slightly. Unfortunately I could still feel the reverberation and bass of the dance music through my earplugs and the several pillows on my head to muffle the sounds.

We were \"upgraded\" to a balcony room, which was very nice, but unfortunately, since it faced the street it was quite loud.    The room was very clean, and large, with a large king, sized bed.  It was very comfortable and a welcome break as our previous Airbnb had the most uncomfortable beds.  They offered a lovely breakfast buffet with the room and it was very generous.  We ate both days at the buffet.  The main downside to this hotel is the location, as it is a little farther away from most of the attractions in Athens.  It is very close to the Greek Parliment buildings, but there were many demonstrations, at the building to it was a place to avoid.    I think the hotel…\n",

The rooms are elegant and normal in size, the bathrooms are quite big and very nicely designed. Breakfast offers a large variation so no matter your diet, you´ll find something on the buffét! The only disappointment was the lobby bar, food was not that good, and expensive and when I ordered champagne I was told it wasn´t cold...

We took the metro from the airport to a Syntagma Swuare and it was less than a block walk to the hotel which is across from the National Gardens.  Excellent and varied breakfast buffet.  The room was nicely appointed although we were out most of the day.  Go up on the roof at night for an excellent view of the Acropolis and a Parliament building.  This would make a great bar/ restaurant area.  Not sure why it has. To been developed .  It appears to be used for nothing.\n",

The bus normally would have been able to drop us off closer to the Amalia Hotel at Syntagma Square but due to the strike, our bus had to drop us off a few blocks away! The hotel posted warning signs about the strike which we thought was nice of them to inform their customers. The room was big and clean and there were chocolates on top of the pillows which was a nice touch! Also the buffet was amazing! They had made to order eggs, crepes;  a variety of cheeses, cold cuts, drinks, regular and Greek coffee, fruits, breads, etc served in a big, beautiful dining room with white tablecloths! All the servers were extra nice, efficient and hard working!…\n",

We did have to wait a few hours for our room to be ready (arrived around 1pm and waiting until 2:30 or 3pm), but after that service was timely. We were 3 friends in a room, and they set us up with 3 single beds - which was unexpected but appreciated.

The waitress in Chrysalis restaurant was also very helpful and kind. I wasn't able to get her name.  Overall, this hotel deserves praise for customer service and great accessibility in Athens. This hotel is very near the tourist spots. Can't go wrong here.\n",

This hotel serves a variety of deliciousness at the complimentary breakfast and the Chrysalis Lobby Lounge was really good, too.

From the front of roof garden, you have the most amazing views of the National Gardens, the Presidential Guards strutting their stuff in front of the Greek Parliament Building and to the rear of the roof the Acropolis. Go when the sun is going down and later when the Acropolis is illuminated. The staff of the Amalia Hotel are very friendly and helpful.

Though the hotel has a rooftop it does not have a restaurant on the rooftop as shown on the hotel website, That was a bit of a letdown, but one can walk out to the rooftop and the view is stunning regardless. I would definitely choose the Amalia again.\n",

The beds are the most comfortable to sleep on - and location is just what we needed - close to everything. It's more for family than I would have hoped but really good place.  Only our last night, their was so much noise. This family was moving out and they made so much noise and the rooms are thinner so we could hear everything.\n",

View from our room we could see the Hellenic parliament. Walking distance to syntagma square, Ermou street, Acropolis, monastiraki and plaka. The room was average, nothing special. Typical \"king\" bed was 2 twin beds pushed together ( one of my pet peeves) and a fold out bed for my daughter.  Decent wifi. Breakfast was included with decent selections. You are paying for location here, the hotel itself is not fancy, but it was clean.  I forgot to take pictures of the actual room.\n",

They didn't want to recommend restaurants because they didn't want to take money from themselves (this is what one front desk woman told us). The bartender when busy was frazzled. I asked if a particular food on the menu was good and he berated me by demanding to know how he was supposed to answer that as the answer would only have to be positive. I told him he could say that it was popular and many people enjoyed it. Anyway, their restaurant is not open for dinner. The room was clean but the walls thin. Nice view of the sea. If you are a light sleeper, keep the windows shut, there are dogs in the night.\n",

Also, as a New Yorker, having a subway station in the area brings a sense of comfort because I never felt any place was out of reach, but I never needed it. Breakfast was included with our stay and the spread was amazing. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The taxi to the airport was a nice €30, too.

It is located bang opposite the Botanical gardens & a stones throw away from the Parliament & Syntagma square. Though it is a chain hotel & you'd expect the mechanical efficiency of large chain hotels from the staff, the staff at Amalia are warm & welcoming & go out of their way to be helpful. We were given an upgrade & had a lovely balcony view of the Botanical gardens. As you check in they give you a map & help you orient yourself along with giving helpful tips.

The hotel is conveniently located right in the heart of the city. All places of interest are within walking distance. The Syntagma station is about 200 meters away.

(10-15 min walk to the Acropolis) and there were always a few taxis outside (taxis were very affordable.) My room had a huge bed and all the normal features, no coffee or tea facilities though. I got the impression that the hotel probably looked better 5 years ago or so and now it's just a little tired. I've not been to Athens before so can't compare it to anything in the city but just compared to other major city hotels. There were stains on the carpet and mattress.

The only downside was the wifi- super slow and more than half the time the connection wouldn't work at all.\n",

      "Review is :I don't really think it's fair to compare hotels like these to much larger hotels with so many more services.  I could have booked a room at The Hilton in Athens for about the same price as this place, and I am quite sure I would have been much more satisfied if I had,    This hotel is very well-located, with a hospitable, friendly staff and a surprisingly, huge breakfast buffet.  However, the lack of additional facilities, services - like a comfortable lobby area, restaurant and pool/spa left me dissapointed.    We arrived - as many travellers from the US do - in the morning - I think it was 10am.  Not surprisingly, our room was not ready.  Certainly not the hotel's fault.  They told us we could leave our bags with them and go walk around the city or hang out in their lobby. …\n",

It's very close to the main square, metro station, bus stop. Beautiful park is located right in front of the hotel.  2. The room was quite good: comfy bed, clean and bright, everything worked well. The only issue - it was a bit noisy outside. 3. Breakfast was generous and of good quality.  4. The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and professional.\n",

Our room had a large balcony with a great view of the Parliament building. You can see the honor guards do their thing at all hours of the night/day. The balcony made the stay memorable!

This is particular important when you visit athens in summer where you can easily come back hotel for a rest before embarking to vist out in the afternoon.\n",

I looked at many hotels in this area before we booked and I couldn't be happier with our selection.  The other hotels either lacked the view, the amenities, or weren't as spectacular in person as they appeared to be online.  Amalia lived up to its ratings, and then beat them.

We had a wonderful view of Parliament and Lykabettos hill. The room was pleasant and comfortable. Breakfast is overwhelming with all the choices from scrambled eggs to creme caramel. The staff are helpful and pleasant. I felt so at home. There was a protest nearby upon our return from Santorini so we had to drag our bags across the street because our driver couldn't park in front. The staff was there immediately to assist us. We chose to eat in the lobby bar as the protest abated, and George took excellent care of us. Our food choices (pasta, salads and club sandwiches) were good and reasonably priced.

Within a few minutes walk is the metro station Syntagma. If you are good by walking you don't need the metro to visit the major sights, because they are mostly close together. The rooms are clean and have a good size, not too small or too big. The bed is big and comfortable, but the double room has two single beds put together. The furniture is not new but in good shape. The room service comes every day. We had a room with windows to a small street, but could still hear the traffic from the main road. The walls in the hotel are silent.

The bathroom in our rooms was so spacious and clean, the shower's water pressure just right. The towels were large and fluffy! The beds weren't bad, I did a lot of tossing and turning, but maybe that was because it got warm at night. We'd then keep the window open, but are now covered in mosquito bites, so I wish we could have more control over the heat/air conditioning. Wifi was spotty.  We could walk to a lot of main attractions, and our Delphi day trip left our hotel.  Quick walk to the X95 bus to airport!!  I would stay here again and recommend it!\n",

It's around 5-8 mins walk to the airport bus station in Syntagma.  Around 15 mins walk to Acropolis, Plaka and Monastriki.  There is a trolley bus station just in front of the hotel which took us to the National Archaeological Museum too for Eur1.40.  Plenty of restaurants in Syntagma within 5-10 mins walk.  Only disadvantage is the sound proofing is not great, and you can hear the street noise at night.  Hotel is a little dated but clean.  We still managed to sleep through thanks to the comfortable beds.  Many varieties of food to choose from for the breakfast, although the food was the same everyday.  Stay here for the location.\n",

We were going to get the bus, but as this was a stopover trip after a holiday spent with family and friends, we had quite a bit of luggage, and pleasantly surprised to find a direct taxi at that price. Breakfast was great, with lots of choice for everyone, both hot and cold dishes. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel was a big plus.

Cons: The only major negative was that although my room was large and well-appointed, it was possible to hear a normal phone conversation going on next door! This may not apply throughout the hotel, as I was in a 'bargain' room that was excellent price bearing in mind the standard of hotel. Also, the corridor carpet was a bit grubby (although daily vacuum-cleaned); this again may be to do with the value-price I was paying.  I was very happy overall however.

The receptionists are a little bit artificial and cold but the overall experience is very good.\n",

Friendly staff checked us in. Room was decent size for 2 people. Breakfast had a big variety to choose from including fresh fruits, pastries and meats, well worth the money. We walked to Acropolis, maybe a 10 min walk. After checkout were stranded for a bit due to ferry and sea travel strike yet hotel staff helped us contact our next hotel of  inform them of our cancelation and helped us book a room at a nearby hotel since they were fully booked.

It had all the basics you needed (comfortable bed, tv, clean shower, cafe in the lobby) but was nothing that I would rave about. The rooftop though I will say is simply amazing. The views are spectacular of the Acropolis. I hope in the future Amalia Hotel is able to make this into a rooftop bar and/or restaurant. Also, I know people that had stayed at the fanciest hotel in the Square who had the same reaction so do yourself a favor, save a few dollars and stay here (especially since you will not be in your room very much in Athens).\n",

We received a very friendly welcome and an upgrade to a spacious room at the front of the hotel with a big (but noisy) balcony and views to Syntagma Square and the National Gardens. The room and bathroom were large and contemporary with a nice selection of bathroom products and a well stocked mini-bar. There are also a number of kiosks right outside the hotel where you can buy water, soft drinks and snacks. The bed was unusually comfortable for Greece with a plush mattress topper.

It was a good location for us to walk to see the main sights in our short amount of time in the city.  We were appreciative of the early check in and room upgrade. It was neat to view the parliament building and national garden from our balcony. Our room was basic, large and clean. Breakfast buffet selection was very large. Street noise is not too loud.

Unfortunately, our flight from Toronto to Athens was cancelled which caused a 24-hour delay, and this hotel showed no compassion in refunding us any amount on our first night at the hotel. Later, when we needed help reorganizing hotels, it was again met with little compassion or help. This hotel would have been great if the hospitality and friendliness was more similar to what we were met with in Turkey.\n",

      "Review is :I've stayed here many times over the years. The service was always excellent. However, the hotel itself is much improved since its refurbishment some years back.  This has got to be one of the most tourist friendly locations in Athens. It's two minutes walk to the coastal tram system, metro station and airport express bus. It's right opposite the National Garden and very close to Syntagma and the Parliament building. Ermou, the main shopping street, is five minutes and the Plaka and Acropolis are ten to fifteen minutes on foot. Be aware of frequent demonstrations in the Syntagma area. There are other ways to reach the hotel in such circumstances.  Breakfast is plentiful, varied and typically Greek. I would eat elsewhere for main meals. There are much better restaurant options…\n",

Bathrooms excellent , but rooms a bit bland however quite acceptable and very clean. Good buffet breakfast with most things that one wants on offer. Decent price for city centre. Do not pay extra for outside rooms or balconies as they will front onto insanely busy road, and will be noisy.

I was pleased with my choice and had a wonderful stay. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was adequate. The booking even included daily buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant, which was exceptional.

The location of the Amalia is perfect really close to key tourist sites as well as shopping and restaurants.   The hop on & off buses have a stop virtually across the road which is really handy.   The staff were fantastic going the extra mile. We were going to Santorini & Mykonos for a few days and then back to Amalia we asked if we could store our main bags at the hotel until we came back and they had no problems with this at all. There wasn't even a cost. This is exceptional service and I will be highly recommending this hotel for future friends and family visits as well as my next visit to Greece\n",

Rooms were an ok size - comfortable for two girls with two 29\" suitcases. Wifi is free but can be patchy at times.   We were surprised that the room didn't come with complimentary coffee/tea making facilities - no pot to boil water, no instant coffee or tea bags. Thankfully, room service is quite prompt. Just ring them if you need hot drinking water like we did. It was free.   It's location is fantastic, just one block from Syntagma Square where the X95 airport shuttle bus station is located. The centre of Athens is pretty much walkable - from Amalia, 2 minutes to Syntagma Square, another 2 more to Ermou …\n",

We did and, of course, paid the bill for the calls.  Perhaps, in all fairness, that was because Athens is really experiencing the financial crisis more than perhaps the islands we visited. We would come back although we prefer a bit more luxury than we got.  Location was excellent - right outside of Plaka - and landmarks in the area - quiet area but very close to tourist area.\n",

The wifi was terrible with constant dropouts, as a business traveller this was annoying and made it very difficult to work from the room. On the plus side the service was professional and the location and breakfast was good. If possible book a room with a balcony or a better room with a view.

      "Review is :The Amalia Hotel is exactly where you want to be in Athens (Syntagma Square). My wife and I were only in Athens for a day before taking a cruise, so we were mostly interested in location. The Amalia is close to the major museums (the Benaki Museum, the often overlooked Byzantine Museum), the Acropolis and the Plaka so it's basically perfect for a day or two in Athens. My wife and I had both been before, so we kind of knew exactly what we wanted to do with our one day.  The room was perfectly nice for our needs and the front desk was very friendly. We had considered splurging for the Hotel Grand Bretagne, but instead we opted to save some money on accommodations and transfer those savings into eating and drinking through the city. I'm very glad that we did as that's frankly more…\n",

      "Review is :Amalia is a great hotel!!- 15 minute walk to the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus. Very close to the 'main' street where there are lots of shops and eating places. The rooms were one of the biggest we've had whilst in Europe. Breakfast was great- must cry the chocolate crepes!! The top level has a great view of Athens and the Parthenon, there were news crew up there both days we stayed so we didn't really feel comfortable up there though.  From the airport the best option is probably getting a train as there is a station 2 minutes away. We caught a bus and it took approximately 45 minutes.\n",

The rooms are like modern hotel rooms with nice and clean interiors. Bathrooms are really good. The rooftop gives a nice view of Acropolis and the City, there is no club or bar there but it is well accessible. The biggest of all things was the breakfast, such a wide spread with live counters.

The only breakdown was that the room we wanted was to have a double bed. Instead, we got two singles. They put them together and made up the bed like a double. It was surprisingly comfortable and not at all a problem for our romp ;-) and sleeping needs. The view was excellent and it was nearby the local nightlife (which wasn't in the immediate area, but less than a 1/4 walk).  If you're considering this hotel, I'd recommend it over any others we stayed at.\n",

The staff at the front desk is accommodating and knowledgeable. The breakfast buffet was HUGE, you could stay there just staring at the delicious stuff all day long before you know what your choice will be.

You can even pop by just across to see the guards doing their drills in front of the Parliament building. Only downside was the central heating being too warm at night (you can try to manage this by turning the fan low or slightly opening the balcony door. Breakfast was excellent though you may get tired of the lack of variety if you stay more than 4 days.

I have done a request on my reservation that I will arrive early night and requested for late check out since I had a few appointments until 13:00 . I have asked for check out at 13:30 . I have arrived at the hotel around 19:00 asked the guy at the reception if it was ok for my late check out and he told me he had no idea. When I said I did requested he checked his notes ( found the request) and very politely told me to ask next morning the reception to help me . This was what I did but the  girl next morning told me that the maximum I can stay was until 12:30. After that I had to cancel the last appointment and I have to mention she has not checked the request either…\n",

A great deal through Expedia included a very good continental breakfast with excellent choices, including a couple of hot dishes ( bacon and eggs) Our room was a good size for city hotel, with views overlooking the park. The bar in the lobby was good for a relaxing refreshment after a day of site seeing. Due to the location you are spoiled for choice with bars, shopping, restaurants, and the hop on, hop off bus tour stops just across from the hotel. This is a perfect location for a trip to Athens, service at check in was very efficient, and our overall experience of the hotel was great.\n",

I ESPECIALLY LOVED the spacious balcony that they provided us with, it was overlooking Syntagma Square (where parliament and changing of the guards is) and beautiful palm trees and gorgeous mountains in the background. It was lovely. Although cars were traveling directly on the street below, there wasn't too much noise. It was average hustle and bustle. The hotel's service was very nice and we had absolutely no complaints or issues. Breakfast was absolutely DELICIOUS! It's worth paying for. The hotel is in the heart of Athens, in my opinion. So many things were in walking distance, including Monastiriaki, which is a great marketplace in Athens with restaurants and night life.…\n",

Very close to all major sights and next to lovely national gardens.

This time, as usual, everything was in accordance with previous expectations, since the very beginning at the reception desk where they (namelly Georges, but also others that I do not remember their names) were so kind to explain all details, including the surprise that Breakfast time for the day of the Marathon was augmented to start at 04:30 instead of 06:30 as any other day of the year, in order to facilitate marathon runners to comply with the early concentration requirements to be moved to Marathonas village (40 km. away) by bus provided by organizers.

All the major tourist sites are within walking distance. Public transport is just outside hotel. I got the bus from the airport X95, which departs from just outside arrivals.  Cost Euro's 5. Bus take's you to Syntagma Square,  the hotel is 150 metres away. It takes about 1 hour from airport.  Taxi would cost Euros 35. Hop on Hop off bus is near by. There are lots of restaurants and coffee places near by. The hotel is modern and clean and rooms are well decorated. You can take the lift to top floor were you can get a good view of Athens day and night.  Breakfast is filling each morning.\n",

Despite the staff's modesty about their English, they were very fluent and very helpful at giving directions and getting taxis.  It does feel a little Best Western-ey, but urban at the same time: the Greek Parliament and a bustling (Constitution) square are right next door as well as many street vendors.  Great breakfast, nice bathroom.  Good location, it's an easy and interesting walk to the Acropolis, National Gardens, and the first Olympic Stadium.  What it loses in originality, it makes up for in reliability, location, and a good staff, and that's pretty much what I wanted.  Visit the nearby Mnisikleous steps for awesome atmosphere.\n",

The hotel is a 20 minute walk from the Parthenon area and pretty central in terms of major transportation (subway and bus). Because the subway and bus stop are very close to the hotel, the hotel was very easy to get to from the airport but a bit removed from the port where the ferries depart (which is normal for nice hotels in Athens). We preferred being closer to the city center so this wasn't a big deal at all.   Overall, the service was great.

Our room had a huge king bed that was very comfy. We arrived very early on our last stay and they let us keep our bags in their storage so we could go shopping in the plaka. Normal check in is 2pm but they kindly had a room available for 10am. We left early the next morning and because we couldn't get the buffet breakfast they arranged and had ready for us a packed breakfast at 5am. Amalia is also very conveniently located. Its a 10minute walk to the centre of the plaka (just exit the front door of the hotel turn right, take…\n",

Since we made the booking we had a very good communication with the team; they organised for us meeting and we could choose from a variety of options for breakfast and coffee breaks in very good prices; the rooms were very clean and spacious; high speed wifi in all areas; the breakfast was very good and tasty. The hotel is close to the metro station, only 40minutes away from the airport, and 10 minutes walking from monastiraki.  I definitely recommend it and I would stay again! A big thank you to the team for the wonderful experience they offered us!\n",

It is perfectly positioned to walk to most attractions and is a safe and easy walk to many tavernas and cafes. The staff are all welcoming and efficient. There is a free computer and printer in the lobby which is useful for online check in. The breakfast is an excellent buffet and it is best to book a\"breakfast included\" package to save money. We have always had excellent rooms and would recommend the deluxe rooms at the front on the highest floor possible. They are slightly affected by road noise but the view is worth it! Also be sure to go up to the roof to have a panoramic view of Athens. Both the airport bus and Syntagma Metro station are only a two minute walk when it's time to leave.\n",

It's super close to the X95 bus stop to the airport and also convenient to the metro to get to Piraeus (although you'll have to change lines). Best of all, the rooms are large and clean, the staff are friendly and the breakfast buffet is wonderful. This is an excellent modern Athens choice and very reasonably priced.\n",

By this time, Gate 1 said the tour was already sold out and there was no way for my husband to by included; therefore, I contacted each hotel via email and asked them if they could accommodate my husband, with an additional fee, of course. To our surprise, when the morning of our checking out of the hotel came, they told us  that it was complimentary. They certainly made our day!\n",

Our room had one Queen Bed, with 2 pairs of slippers waiting for us.  The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious and clean.  The 2 areas where this hotel really shines are location and breakfast.  The hotel is 1 block from Syntagma Square, so the location is perfect for exploring all parts of Athens.  It is across the street from the National Gardens, and walking distance from most sites.  There is a metro stop at Syntagma Square, so it's also very easy to hop on the metro to get wherever you need to go.  If you arrive late at night like we did, the Airport Bus X95 drops off at Syntagma Square, so it is a quick 3 minute…\n",

Fantastic breakfasts offering a variety of choice. Friendly and efficient front desk.  In terms of the room, the bathroom is roomy and clean and the rest of the room is also a good size and mostly clean, but the carpet was dated and looked like it could use a good scrub.

The breakfast was absolutely first class with a selection to suit all tastes and nationalities served in a very pleasant room.  The staff at reception were efficient and helpful especially the young lady in the evening who helped with airline boarding passes and seat reservations.  A pleasant stay slightly marred by the lunatic taxi driver who drove us to the airport.  On my next visit I shall definitely take the airport bus which leaves from just around the corner..\n",

      "Review is :I booked this hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of my trip with my 18 year old daughter and on our last night in Greece. This hotel was very clean and the location was wonderful. We took the X95  (5 euro each person - each way) airport bus which arrives and departs from Syntagma Square situated very close to the hotel. The hotel faces the Botanical Gardens which is very pretty. It was a short walk away from the Temple of Zeus and Plaka which had many restaurants and gift shops. The Hop on Hop Off Bus stop is nearby and a great way to travel around. We did do an organized tour of the Acropolis which was booked directly from the hotel and we were picked up in the lobby. The breakfast was very good with lots of variety. The staff were very helpful. Would definitely chose this…\n",

I had a great welcome, my room 207 was ready, very clean and spacious. I was told that I was upgraded with a balcony; nice your are just in front of the garden. The subway is near buy, the Parlement building also. Rhe restaurant and shop distrijust around. The biggest department store of Greece is almost next door. I had asked to have my room the day I came back from the cruise. I arrived in the mornind around 9:00 a.m. and was pleasantly supprised, my same room (207) was ready for me so I could put my luggage and go for a bus tour . Would go back again if ever in Athens.

Check in was really quick and we were able to get to our room within 5 minutes of arrival.   The room itself was very spacious and very clean. We were given a room with a balcony which looked out onto the main road (which was brilliant as we were there for labour day and could see the march up the main road and watch all the police in formation). I didn't think the hotel room was noisy at all - although, we were only in the room at night as we spent the majority of our days sight seeing and travelling. We slept the whole night through every night, the windows must be sound proof as we were not disturbed at all, which is strange…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed her 2 nights in April. Initially we we checked in we expected the room to be quite small which it was. We had to get the maintenance man up to get the fridge going and also the TV to work. We also asked about the air con as our room was a little warm. He told us to turn the dial down and turn up the fan and we did. In about 30 mins time the room felt like the Sahara desert and upon going down to reception they told me that the air con in the hotel is in fact \"Central heating/cooling\". This means that they either have it on heating or cooling for the whole hotel, you cannot adjust yours to suit. He told me it was cold outside so it is on heat and to turn off and open our windows. However I advised that as our hotel room is towards the from of the hotel and main road it…\n",

At least this covers the noise from the next room, that we could clearly hear on 1 May when traffic was stopped for a couple of hours. Bring you Earplugs , they are not offered by the hotel .. Or choose another address (many nicer ones in the small streets close to acropolis!)\n",

The ambiance in the lobby and the breakfast room was dignified and luxurious.  The hotel's location was great.  We walked from Syntagma square metro station and had no trouble finding the hotel.  The only problem we encountered was being pickpocketed as we left the train at Syntagma square - Wear a money belt.  The pickpockets in Athens are magicians in how they use slight of hand to get into your front pocket without you even knowing!!\n",

      "Review is :I have been visiting this hotel for decades, and it is finally looking quite good after refurbishment.  Best part about it is the location, just yards from Metro stop and Syntagma square, and a short stroll to Plaka and Monastiraki.  So hundreds of restaurant and bar options nearby, plus most tourist spots easily reachable by foot or metro.   Room decent size and on the side road as I requested (quieter), and breakfast was fine. Very helpful reception staff, sorted out a 6 hour extension for me (and charged me but that is fair enough) as I had a late flight. Of course I will go there again.\n",

It is also near to all the major tourist attractions and the Plaka district with its bars and restaurants. We had booked a basic twin room which was ideal for our needs. It was very clean with a good sized bathroom. The room was however rather hot and we could not control the temperature at the room thermostat. The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of hot and cold food. All of the staff were very friendly and the man on reception explained where the computer was for us to print out our boarding passes for the return journey. A superb view from the hotel rooftop of Athens. Would certainly recommend this hotel. Only grumble was the bar closed at 11.00pm prompt.\n",

In addition the carpet that the floor was covered needs change since it looked pretty old. In addition basic health neccesities such as toothpaste, toothbruch, bathrobe and slippers were not offered for a 4 star hotel.

Only problem is with the air conditioning, I stayed in room 502 and 503 (stayed twice during my trip) and both times the a/c was not cold enough even though I turned it all the way to 10deg C as stated on the control. I think the main reason is that the room has a glass panel and door leading to the balcony which…\n",

The location is ideal-walking distance to the Acropolis sights and just off a subway line which is an easy 2 stop trip to the National Museum.  The rooms are not particularly spacious, but for the price, it's very nice and clean.  Would recommend it!\n",

The room was of a standard size and fair condition.   But a downside was that to access wifi, guests had to pay a fee of 5 euros. Some of the desk staff - in particular a woman - were at times impatient and arrogant when we asked for directions to various tourist spots. Why work in a hotel if you are not helpful in taking questions from your guests who are strangers to the city?   There are many other hotels of similar standard offering better rates and service. I would suggest trying those first before choosing Amalia.\n",

We had a balcony, which looked over the national gardens and was quite nice.  There was no balcony furniture, but the room had a set of chairs and a table, and we brought the chairs out to use the balcony.  We got the breakfast one day, which I thought was steep at 8 euros per person, but it was certainly a plentiful buffet.  The location was also great--literally right by the Syntagma stop on the metro and an easy walk to nearly all the major tourist destinations.\n",

Easy!  To get to the Acropolis is about 15min walk down the main road and along the way you're see Temple of Zeus and if you walk out of the way you'll see where they held the first Olympics. Plaka, an area full of shop and food is 10mins walk. The main Market is about 15min walk. Very good location indeed.

Besides that, hotel and service definitely not four star material.  - the rooms have really thin walls and gets quite noisy - view opens out to the wall of the next door building inspite of having made a special pre request to have some good views. Not just a terrible  view but no sunshine coming into the room as well. Makes for a dull start to the day and have never had such a dull dark room in all the travelling I've done - I'd asked for a extra bed as offered as I was travelling with a 3 year old child. But they just put a cot in the room . A cot is definitely not the same as an extra bed. And if they didn't have…\n",

The hotel was easy to get to using public transportation--excellent location across from an extensive garden, a short walk from Syntagma square and within walking distance of the Acropolis.  It was also handy to have the hop-on bus stop practically across from the hotel.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  There's a great view from the top floor of the Acropolis at night.  After seeing some of the areas where the other hotels were located, I was glad we had chosen the Amalia.  Not particularly elegant, but clean, comfortable and in a perfect location.\n",

The hotel was not luxurious but adequate, the good location was great for walking to the Plaka area and to the Acropolis and other sites.  Breakfast was very nice. The room décor was a bit dreary and could have done with some colour, but the view was good. Our room was at the front of the hotel with a balcony but we wouldn't have sat out there as the barrier at the front of it was quite low and was a bit unnerving. On the couple of sunny days we had the room became quite hot and the air conditioning was not very efficient, but the staff provided me with a fan on request, for extra cooling.

But what prompt me to write this review is the hotel staff's unparalleled service while I was there, and more importantly even after I had left:  In January 2013, 4 months after my stay at Amalia, I realised that I needed the hotel lounge receipts (3 of them) in order to have my claims processed by my company. The figure wasn't a lot, but money is money, so I emailed to the hotel, thinking there is very little chance that they would even care... after all I am not a VIP guest.

Easy to get there from airport (Bus number X95), easy to get to any tourist site by walk (5-15) minutes (Parliament, Acropolis, Monastiraki, Plaka, Stadium, Tzeus, Omonia) and if not by walk, by all the traffic options (Metro, Tram, Bus). The room was very clean and room accessories are kept in very good condition. The breakfast is rich and tasty. The price is fair.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the Amalia Hotel for four nights at the end of October 2012.  The hotel's position, near to Syntagma Square, was brilliant as all roads seem to lead there.  With the tram terminus and bus stops right outside you can easily travel all over the city and beyond.  The room was reasonably spacious with a balcony over looking the National Gardens and towards the Parliament Building.  We watched the Ochi Parade on Sunday morning - 28th October - from the balcony, and had an amazing view of it.  The staff were generally welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast was varied and plentiful, although some hot dishes were often cold.  We really enjoyed our stay in Athens and would stay at the Amalia Hotel again.\n",

Reception was handed very professionally by a courteous, competent concierge.  Customer service is certainly a priority here. We had a modern, beautiful room on the fourth floor overlooking the Amalias Avenue and the park and we could see the changing of the guards at the Parliament Buildings to the left. We had a comfortable bed, spacious washroom with sufficient amenities and fluffy towels. The room was spotless.  This hotel has an ideal location. It was only a few minutes stroll from Syntagma Square, the Plaka and the myriad of Tavernas located there. It is only about a 30 minute leisurely stroll to the Acropolis. A visit to…\n",

Well connected (subway and X95 bus to the airport running 24h). The view from the roof in the evening is amazing. Rooms are very clean and new and the buffet breakfast is amazing, a mix of continental and greek specials (from pain au chocolat to halva, feta, dolmades,... ). I very much appreciated this fusion. For the \"pros\" it should be a ****. My only \"cons\" are related to the size of the room (very small for being a de-luxe room), very loud (it is on the main road, and even though closing the window might help it is still perceivable), you have to pay for wifi (5 euro for 24h, it is a 4* hotel and this should be considered a minimal…\n",

The hotel is located nearby Syntagma Square and the National Garden of Athens is just across the street. It is the best location you can get if you plan a short stay in Athens, which we did.  Syntagma Square is one of the transportation hub in Athens. There are subways and buses directly linked to the Airport. Also there are several tour buses circling around the attractions of the city passing through.  Front row…\n",

In a very short time we were at the base of the Acropolis, ready to climb up. We tagged behind various English speaking tour groups to listen in on the history & explanations. After a couple hours we headed back to our hotel, & checked in to our room. What a pleasant surprise. It was very nice, good size, beautiful bathroom, smelled very clean, & very quiet. After we freshened up we went to explore & within minutes we were at the 'plaka': the shopping district. It was fabulous. Great patio restaurants, wonderful…\n",

      "Review is :We are traveling in Europe in the entire July of 2012. We have been 5-6 cities before we arrived Athens. Amalia Hotel is the best among the hotels we have stayed. It's conveniently located at the Acropolis area in Athens, near all the major attractions. It also only about 50 meters from the Metro station. On top of these, the service in the hotel is just superb. The receptionists are very very friendly. They went out of their way to help us. We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and then went to Santorini island for 3 nights. Because we like the hotel so much, I wanted to book the hotel again on our way back. Unfortunately, they were fully booked. But when I was searching on the booking.com website, there was a hotel called Amarillia in Athens. So I mistaken that was Amalia. So…\n",

The shopping districts of Plaka and Monastiraki are within walking distance too.   The hotel amenities are top notch, and the only grouse I have is that wi-fi was paid (5 Euro for 24 hours), which isn't befitting a hotel with this tariff structure. Complimentary breakfast could've had more variety from day-to-day, but the spread was varied anyway, so not a big complaint unless you're staying there for more than 4-5 days.\n",

The hotel is within walking distance of all major sights including the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Plaka, Central Market, Adrian’s Gate, Temple of Zues, etc.  A complimentary map (available in each room or from the front desk) makes it easy to navigate to area.

There was a taxi strike in Greece and its proximity to bus and metro stations was very convenient.   My room was clean and OK. However the room was disappointingly small. Especially in bathroom there was hardly any space to move. When you take a shower it is a flood. Owing to the size of the room, air-condition was strong enough to make it snow indoors.   The most disappointing side of it was that I was hoping for a national park view. When I opened my curtains the view was some old buildings, other rooms etc. That was a kind of view you get when you stay in a hostel, share the room with other 15 people and pay 12 euros a night. I stay at that kind of places too, yet if it is a business trip,…\n",

The hotel is steps away from a metro stop and right around the corner from public buses that run to/from the airport.  In addition, it's only 10-15 minutes walking from all the main sites, including the Acropolis.  The location is in a very safe neighborhood so one is able to walk out late at night and early in the morning.  The rooms are a bit on the small size with equally small twin beds and a closet-size bathroom.  However, the room is very clean and the buffet breakfast is excellent!   Amalia's views are fantastic, if you are able to get a room on one of the higher floors.  Would definitely return to this hotel.\n",

The inexpensive airport bus took us to Syntagma Square, which was five minutes walk to the Amalia Hotel.

It was an easy walk to the Acropolis and to all the other sights from the Amalia Hotel.  The beautiful Benaki museum is about 10 minutes away.  The only place we traveled to by streetcar was the National Archeological Museum.  For our day trips to Delphi and later to Mycenae, we were picked up at the hotel.

Highly recommend dining in Plaka and enjoy the night shopping scene, beautiful indeed!  If you are looking for leather goods, look no further, you will find shoes and shoes and more shoes!

      "Review is :The location is perfect - 5 min walking distance from Syntagma metro station. You can even see the change of guards from the hotel's terrace. The view of the Temple of Zeus is quite good.   Service is prompt. There was no iron or iron board in the room, but, we were promptly led to a small room on the top floor that housed the same.   The room was small, but cosy. The view from the window was the only dampner - the view was that of the building to our side.   The area around the hotel was safe to walk through at night . The Acropolis was 15 min walking distance; Plaka was 10 min walking distance.   Breakfast was good and had ample choice for vegetarians.   Highly recommended for the location.\n",

Nothing outstandingly luxurious, but the bed was comfortable, and it was clean.  The location is excellent.  Easy walk to just about everything.  We walked to the Acropolis, through Monastiraki, Parliament Square, the Plaka, and even up to Lycabettus Hill for dinner at Orizontes.  We enjoyed the computer terminal on the first floor for quick and easy access to loved ones back home.

But neither this hotel, nor our room at the \"Superior\" rate which we paid were great.  We were booked as late arrivals who dragged ourselves in around 9:00PM from Omonium Square (a dump), a couple of streets away expecting a Superior, front-facing room with a balcony over the Greek Parliament and National Gardens right across the street. Right?  Wrong!

Confort was good also, the room was large. The staff was very helpful: they upgraded our room from basic to executive the the higher level for free. Very good choice for breakfast.

However it was the last part of our Honeymoon and we wanted to end up with some style.  Staff could be a little more friendly to guests, we have seen few embarassing situations with staff arguing with guests at reception. They do need more staff at the breakfast room.   You will notice that the majority of guests are senior travellers, usually groups or families.  Good, but can be improved.\n",

Great location,very close to Syntagma square and near the express bus to the airport.Clean,modern room and bathroom ,facing the National Garden.Although we had chosen the deluxe room we didnt find anything special.A small tv,a round table with two chairs ,etc. The breakfast was very good with many choices. There were no coffee facilities and if you ordered coffee from room service it would cost 6 euros. We would stay there again because there were no frills, the location is perfect,the room was nice and the staff very polite.\n",

We noticed, once we got to Athens, that many of the others on our short list (4-5) did not have either windows or balconies (except Athens Gate)..of the twenty on our list, we chose Amalia and were not disappointed. One we looked at was on a pedestrian street and I suppose a person would have to walk to it.  You walk out the door and turn a few corners and you are right in the Plaka...I was surprised that we could walk to Monastriaki flea market in about ten minutes...Acropolis was about 15-20...and no worries about danger...it is a nice neighbourhood....we walked back after ten PM many nights without…\n",

No noise, even though Amalia is on a major street - possibly because of shut windows and higher floor.  Equivalent to a good US business hotel (e.g. Hilton). No issues at all.\n",

Lots of honkings and the pollution was quite bad in the evening. A room facing inside w/o a balcony should be much quieter. Other then that, I still like Amalia over others. American Breakfast is great and generous with selection, compared to other hotels in Greece. Good location and a short stroll gets you everywhere.\n",

I found the Central Market (a 20 minute walk) fascinating, with their rows and rows of meat stalls, then rows of fish, etc.  It was easy to get to from the airport.  The X95 bus (outside exit 5 on arrival level, buy ticket at outside booth for 5 euro) went to Syntagma Square as its last stop (about 45 minutes).

We asked the duty person who then told us that in winter the aircon is switched off and there was only heating.

Saved time and money by walking to all major sites in Athens. very close to Stygmaya Station and Parliment Building.  The hotel was little pricy but was very cosy and comfortable. I would recommend this for short visits to Athens.\n",

You can walk easily through Plaka from this hotel.  The Parliament is just across the street.  It is very quiet.   The city tour bus (hop-on hop-off) is just around the courner, so you can take it any place else you need to go.  We felt safe every where we went - even late at night.  We did not feel the same way about walking,  during the day, around Omni Square where several other hotels are located.  Great view of the Acorpolis from their roof.\n",

The hotel is stylish, the staff polite and helpful, there's free wifi in the lobby and they serve the best, most comprehensive and generous (and delicious) breakfast you'll ever eat in your life.  Anything that you can imagine, sweet, savoury, you name it, is available for breakfast.  My room was huge and well serviced, with the little goodies in the bathroom refilled every time something got used.  The location is also a godsend as it's so close to Syntagma station for the wonderful Athens Metro and so many buses too (including the Airport Express only 50m away).  I travel to Athens every couple of years and will always stay here from now on: loved it!\n",

      "Review is :We upgraded our Greece package to the Hotel Amalia after hearing about the protests in Athens, as our base hotel wasn't in the best area, according to TripAdvisor reviews.  We didn't do our research very thoroughly though, because we learned upon arrival that the Hotel Amalia was in Syntagma Square, diagonal to the Parliment, the center of the protests!   Despite its proximity to the recent protests (and riot, evidenced by smashed windows that were being replaced as we arrived), we felt extremely safe at this hotel.  The location really was ideal, only a short walk from the Plaka, coffee shops, restaraunts and great shopping.    Management was excellent, helpful, and friendly.

Syntagma Metro Station is also less than 5 mins' away.  It has easy access to Plaka as well as within walking distance from the new Acropolis Museum, about a leisurely stroll of 15 mins along Amalias Ave.   Its breakfast, included in the rates, was fantastic and value for money.  Other more expensive hotels we stayed in did not even offer such a wide spread.  We chose Amalia for its location and it surely did not disappoint.  For the price we paid, it was good value for money and naturally we did not expect first class service.

It has a wide variety of selection, lots of hot foods and vegetarian friendly.   The staff is nice if you only have one simple question.  They become impatient and even rude when you have more than one.  I would give them 0 for service if that was a an option.

The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms well appointed and the included breakfast buffet was impressive with much to choose from.  My only complaint would be that the bed was very firm to hard and the pillows really had no substance, which was not conducive to a good nights sleep.

Although we got a free upgrade from superior room to luxury room (so I cannot say about the value of the room...), the overall feeling from this hotel is positive. After reading posts of Amalia, we decided to pay some extra for the superior and the free upgrade was nice surprise at the arrival.  Location right next to Syntagma and parlament was nice, and within walking distance anywhere in the centre (maybe 10min to Acropolis). Of course the location showed the worst side during the riots in 5th of May but it should not affect the overall opinion of the hotel.  If (and when) we'll go to Athens again, this is defenitely the hotel for us.\n",

They were indeed sultry and tended to smell musty unless the fan was on, and the fan is only on if your key is in the slot. I raised this with management and they explained that at this time of year (October) they do not operate cooling aircon, only recirculation, and the weather outside - which…\n",

The room was nice, spacious and bathrooms great and the location is good as it is just one block away from Syntagma. We got a great deal for one night stay (Eur 95) so were happy. Would recommend this for stay in Athens.\n",

We had to turn our AC as cold and as high as it could go and our room never really seemed to cool off and always smelled musty. I can't imagine what it must be like in August. Being in our room was just depressing. We did not think the breakfast was that great. We ate there the first morning and then went elsewhere the other mornings we were there. The website boasts a restaurant on the roof with views of the Acropolis. We tried to go up there, but the door was locked. We were very disappointed in this hotel.\n",

Good hotel, but needs upgrading. Very disappointed that I had to pay a high fee for WFI for my own computer in the room so had to wait for the one in the lobby to be free. Most 4 star hotels do not charge for WFI.\n",

Much to our luck, the shuttle bus that dropped us in athens city centre from Patras (we took a ferry from Bari, Italy to Greece) dropped us off right across the street from this hotel!  The Amalia is unassuming from the outside, looking like a slightly run-down building. The inside, however, is stunning, with clean, modern decor and beautiful facilities. The front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming and, much to our surprise, they upgraded us for free from our standard room to a deluxe one with a gorgeous view overlooking the national gardens on account of us being on our honeymoon.

In the evening, the front desk wasn't as helpful, but after speaking with Nikos Fallieras, the front desk manager, the following morning, he assured us that we could stay.  It was our first trip to Athens, and after various friends had told us that three days would be enough, we had to disagree with them.

Staff were professional but didn't seem to be the most eager to help (judging based on the other staff we encountered in our hotels in the Greek Islands during this trip).  Maybe just a big city mentality.   The rooms were comfortable and clean. The rate was affordable.  The location is unbeatable walking distance to Plaka and its numerous tabernas/acropolis and even Monastiriki. We walked everywhere during our trip.  Do check out the changing of gaurd at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of the Parliament square. The traditional costumes are wonderful.\n",

      "Review is :I think when trying to find hotels in Athens, one need’s to understand the different areas and use certain criteria as the baseline for evaluation and selection  This hotel was in a very safe area right on symmagta square (sort of pretty park, kind of like Union Square in San fran) right behind Platica where the restaurants/shopping reside and also 3 blocks from the Acropolis .  It had convenient access from the bus from the airport that drops you off right on symmagta square (45 minute ride). The service and people were very nice and accommodating. The Internet in the room worked very well too.  There are some not so very nice area’s in Athens and this Hotel was in a nice area, you felt secure.

The service at check-in was friendly, the breakfast (included in our rate, but around 12 Euros extra if not) was good....cereal, fruit, yogurt and honey, breads, eggs, bacon....something for everyone.  The room itself looked clean enough...although the stains on the floor were not great.  We came back after a day out on the town and our room was \"cleaned\", although a dirty napkin and juice glass were still left on the counter, making me think that maybe it was cleaned, just picked up a bit with fresh towels.

Staff are really helpful and speak faultless English if that's a concern for you.  The hotel's location is superb.  Across the road from the National Gardens and Parliament, down the street from Syntagma Square and a short walk inton the ancient Plaka district.  You could see the Acropolis from our bedroom window and it is walkable to all the major sites of Athens.  Breakfast (a bit expensive if not included in your room rate)  was good, loads of choice.  My only concern is how good the air conditioning is if you were staying in the heat of mid-summer.  My girlfriend and I loved Athens and Hotel Amalia is a great place to see it from.\n",

As an added benefit it is a 3 minute walk from Constitution Square where a Metro stop can be found as well as 24hr public bus service to the Airport.  The latter is important since a taxi from/to the airport can cost between 45-55 Euros while the bus is 3.20 Euros.

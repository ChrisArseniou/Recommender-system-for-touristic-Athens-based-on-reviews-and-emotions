      "Review is :This is a great hotel within walking distance of all the attractions.  The hotel has a 5* rating so it does deliver that service. It has a magnificent terrace on the 10th floor that overlooks the Acropolis, here you will find the restaurant, bar and outdoor pool. The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed with a small balcony and some rooms face the Acropolis. However, you will need to be on the upper floors to get a good view. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room had the usual amenities, bathrobes, sleepers, complimentary water, tea & coffee and a well stocked bar fridge. The bathroom was very modern with a large glass enclosed rain shower (YES, no bath or shower curtain!); however some rooms have a shower bath. The water pressure and temperature were always excellent. The buffet style breakfast was included and was served at the restaurant on the 10th floor, the food on offer was fresh, delicious, well presented and the serving staff attentive. We used the restaurant and bar many times during our stay as the views from here are outstanding. If I were to return to Athens again I would definitely stay at this establishment. …\n",

As other reviewers have mentioned,  the location is perfect for walking to all the main sights .  Our room was a good size with a balcony .  The bathroom was spacious with good storage and powerful shower.  The air con was very efficient and quiet.  Also the room was quiet for sleeping .  The breakfast had everything you could wish for , from cooked to order omelettes to delicious pastries . Also excellent cappuccino !  The staff coped very well on one of the mornings when the number of people at breakfast was high.  The one negative was the size of the roof top pool with regard to the number of guests.

The rooftop bar/breakfast area had fantastic views of the Acropolis. The breakfast service was very good and they offered everything you could want to start your day. The location was excellent, walking distance to everything we wanted to see and do. Even though the hotel was very busy while we were there, there was never an issue getting a table at breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel when in Athens.\n",

A couple of minor irritations with breakfast, in the main due to the fact that the restaurant area is quite small in relation to the hotel. That said the view of the Acropolis from the restaurant makes up for this.\n",

      "Review is :When I was researching what hotel to stay at during our trip to Athens, I saw that Electra Metropolis had a roof terrace with a view of the Acropolis. But nothing prepared me for the absolutely stunning sight of it lit up at night.  We went to the rooftop restaurant for drinks our first night and our jaws literally dropped at the view directly in front of us.  This alone made our trip to Greece worth it!  The hotel was  beautiful.  Our suite on the 9th floor was huge. The staff were all very helpful and friendly.  The location was perfect and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see.  We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat next time we are in Athens.  Simply wonderful hotel.\n",

      "Review is :There is more than one Electra hotel in Athens so it's important to make sure you're looking at the right one when boking. The Electra Metropolis Athens is a new five-star hotel in the downtown area right near Syntagma square. The location is good as it's a short flat walk from Syntagma metro station which is on the metro line that runs to Athens airport and also a junction station between metro lines making it super easy to get around the city. The Electra Metropolis Athens is walking distance to Plaka and the Acropolis so it's an all-round great location.  The hotel itself is either new or freshly renovated. I couldn't quite tell. The rooms were spacious, fresh and very well appointed - what you would expect from a five star hotel. It was easy to work from the room and the…\n",

Sounded perfect to cool off after a day's sightseeing. Unfortunately,  on our 2nd day  there was no space at all and our 3rd we managed to grab a wee corner early eve but there was some kind of private party happening in the adjacent bar area which was very noisy so in the end we didn't stay long. Cramped pool area for the size of the hotel (but rooftop pool is a bonus nonetheless) However, overall a great way to start our honeymoon.\n",

There is a rooftop restaurant and bar with fantastic views of the pantheon, great places to watch the sunset. The rooms were very well appointed, clean and quiet. The front desk, concierge, bar and restaurant staff were all professional, courteous and friendly. There is a small indoor pool and a small pool on the rooftop. Great location, we'd definitely return\n",

I was close to all the sites I wanted to visit, the pool was refreshing for my husband after a hot day out exploring, and suite with sofa bed in the living room worked for our teen son perfectly. The breakfast served over looking the Acropolis is hearty and having drinks there in the evening is a special treat while viewing the Parthenon lit up at night.   We also had to change our plans several times due to covid challenges and the staff was very helpful and accommodating to our needs. I will visit Athens again, and will definitely stay at Electra Metropolis when I do.\n",

And although it's right in the center of town, it is actually pretty quiet, no street noise at all in our room.  The service was fantastic.  We checked in very early and they actually had anticipated that and had our room ready for us.  Furthermore, after we checked out, our daughter realized she had left her AirPods in the room.  I called the hotel, they located them and we were able to pick them up later in the week before our departure from Greece.  The view from the rooftop bar/restaurant is amazing!    The one thing that I would say is a drawback is the size of the pool.  While it's great they have a pool on the rooftop, it is the smallest pool you can imagine…\n",

Staff at the roof were great. Beyond that, there is very little 5 star about this place. The views from anything but the Deluxe rooms and suites at the very top of the hotel is of a very ugly building across the road. Furnishings are fine, nothing overly luxurious, but bedding is NOT great. I think they bought the pillows in IKEA. Would give it a solid 4 star rating, maybe, on a generous day. Spend a bit more and go to the Grande Bretagne if you want to see what 5 star really feels like. Price difference is worth it.\n",

Whilst the 'feel' of the hotel has a certain business quality to it, do not be concerned, this is also a comfortable and warm tourist and family hotel of very high quality.

Room cleaning service was quick and efficient. The rooftop restaurant where breakfast is served are amazing (the rooftop pool was not in service in March, but there's an indoor pool as well).

The bathroom was elegant and there was a fantastic range of toiletries and bathroom products. The view from the room of the acropolis and Parthenon was magical, a room with a view is definitely recommended. We got access to the pool before we left thanks to the flexibility offered (thank you).

      "Review is :I stayed at the Electra for five nights, and due to the time of year and Covid, the hotel was not full. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The location of the hotel was fantastic and I walked to and from all the major sites from there. However if you are unable to walk far, you can catch the double decker bus from the Natural History Museum which is a five minute walk away. Breakfast is included and there is plenty of choice with a high quality of food and drink. The views from the restaurant and the terrace are fantastic, as you get views of the city, mountains and the Acropolis.\n",

Went for the larger room with the view of the Panthenon - so well worth the extra to have this view - at sunrise and sunset it’s magical (and light up at night). Room was super comfortable and had a balcony. Linens were high quality.  The breakfast area has amazing views and the buffet is high quality (it was very busy over the weekend).  The location is perfect - close to everything - and a lot of great restaurants within 1-2 minute walk (Nolan’s, Ella’s, Saita).  Gym was only available via booking (one room at a time) - a bit clunky to get a booking and seemed a lot of cancellations - although good size and well equipped.  Would definitely return and highly recommend.\n",

Our visit started great on arrival by having our room ready before official check in. The Suite is spacious with two full bathrooms, a living room w/a fold out bed and a bedroom. Best of all is a balcony the length of the suite with very comfortable furniture and an amazing view.  We were also gifted a bottle of red wine and some chocolates. Both rooms had TVs and desks. I really appreciated the amenities in the bathroom which included a dental kit and razor and a first for me, a shower poof.

Location is very central, minutes from Syntagma square, Akropolis and the cosy Plaka. The hotel offered an early breakfast for marathon runners!  Off note: At check-in we were recommended to register for Elektra rewards, did it on the day of arrival. Unfortunately we were not rewarded with the benefits and our points for the stay, with an unreasonable explanation. If you don’t want tourists to become members, simply don’t…\n",

      "Review is :In short:  The Electra Metropolis Athens provided excellent facilities and service and is conveniently located in Athen's Plaka district, making it within walking distance to important sites such as the Acropolis.   Measured in the key categories*, they score an almost perfect 4.9 average.  The long story:  The Electra is a converted office building on a small but lively street in the Plaka region; multiple dining options and option hotels surround it.  Having said that, the hotel is itself something of a haven, and little of the not insignificant hustle and bustle permeates into the hotel and none into our room.  Very tastefully decorated throughout, the hotel provides an oasis in an otherwise somewhat chaotic Athens.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Acropolis…\n",

Well stocked with all the expected amenities.

      "Review is :Planned in June, we went ahead with this Greece trip amidst the Delta COVID-19 variant. This hotel in Athens is very well located, just a couple of blocks from Syntagma Square. We took the Metro train from the airport, and the station is a 5-8 minute walk to the hotel. The hotel staff, including the ones at the rooftop restaurant, are warm, welcoming and ready to assist you with your needs. The hotel is very tasteful, not big and busy like a Hilton or Hyatt. Our room was very nice, although we booked a Classic room with no views. Which is as well, since we were out and about exploring the Acropolis and the city. The roof top restaurant and bar and pool gives you magnificent views of the Acropolis, with unique views from day to night. We had dinner at the restaurant one night,…\n",

Sparkling clean, it deserves a high award for excellence in Covid-prevention measures. We will return!   But after two visits, I now describe it as the unstuffy Grande Bretagne for the practical, value-conscious 99%. The good-looking staff is smartly outfitted, quick to greet you, and prompt to deliver service. The rooms are spacious by any standard and beautiful with subdued color schemes, upgraded fabrics and sleek, contemporary fixtures. We started to relax as soon as we went through the door.   Not many frills, but it means you are not paying for amenities you won’t need or use. No high tea in the public rooms?…\n",

This is a modern and elegant hotel conveniently located near the Acropolis and Plaka neighborhood. It has spacious rooms and updated bathrooms.  If you can, get a room at a high floor with Acropolis view, you won’t regret the extra money...one of the best views of the city. Staff is very attentive.  Roof top restaurant is excellent,  very good food and service; and a beautiful view. An interesting fact hotel vestibule is built around/atop a tiny beautiful Byzantine church.\n",

We felt welcome and at ease the moment we walked through the doors. We were immediately greeted by the dayshift manager Nick. Even though he was assisting another customer he readily greeted us immediately as we enter the door. He was very friendly and approachable. Plus he’s a great dancer lol, which I can attest to because on our last night in Athen he sillily danced with us in the beautiful main lobby area just for fun.

Large balcony, spacious room, bathroom had the good quality toiletries Korres, soft and extremely white towels and comfortable bed. Amazing view from the room. Wi- Fi was quite good, TV had a good choice of channels in different languages.  The breakfast was very tasty and served on the 10th floor in the hotel restaurant with incredible Acropolis view. The management has sent a complimentary bottle of wine and a fruit basket. Luckily, the restaurant was open for the residents of the hotel, so we had a chance to eat indoors.

Room on 9th floor lovely with small balcony, spacious and nice bathroom. Housekeeping serviced the room daily -  didn't need to be asked. Hand sanitizer was placed on the bedside table which was a good move.  A couple of gripes - one was that tea and coffee weren't renewed, the pillows were hard though they did bring me another one on request -  and the lift policy wasnt enforced - ie only people from the same room allowed to travel in the same lift at the same time. Some people didn't seem to be aware of this covid policy.  Breakfast was handled well re social distancing and the staff were friendly and helpful. No one had long to wait…\n",

We were in Athens predominantly for the acropolis and you really couldn't conjure up a better location and view than the Electra for such a visit (I giddily snuck out of bed on numerous occasions each night to sneak another glimpse at the Parthenon). Staff, hygiene and logistics were all appropriate for Corona concerns.  My only gripe would be that the restaurant still operates on the \"serve one carrot with an elaborate squiggle of jus and you can call it 'high cuisine' and charge a fortune\" attitude that most top European hotels and restaurants grew out of about 10 years ago.  That aside, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I would absolutely recommend my friends stay here if visiting Athens.\n",

Mind you, my husband is Greek so he asked for a table in Greek. You'd think that wouldn't be an issue and we'd get the same treatment as all other customers. However, we were met with an attitude and were placed literally at the worst table possible. We were ignored and orders not taken. Others - clearly tourists - were treated very differently. I can only assume that this had something to do with them thinking we're cheap Greeks who won't be spending any money.    My take away: if you're visibly a tourist…\n",

The service was great, and very efficient, the staff were all very lovely.   All staff members took the correct procedures in following covid guidelines by wearing masks in all places of the hotel and hand sanitisers were provided around the hotel.   The best part was the rooftop bar! Amazing views of the Acropolis hill and the service was amazing. Breakfast is also served at the rooftop, the food was average. Not much of a range but it did the job.   The rooms were modern and a great size, i will be recommending this hotel to others. It was definitely worth the price! Great hotel.\n",

Negatives were a stressful bureaucratic check in - we were looking forward to using the spa but unlike others we were not worthy of receiving the necessary information (does the hotel profile who might spend or not?). Also did not receive basic information like check out time (it is 11am). The pool area was constantly packed so was a pretty useless amenity if this is a reason to stay here. The safe in the room was not working and they were a bit mean with toiletries.   Despite the positives, we would not stay here again if we end up back in Athens (with curfews and rising Covid cases - it may well be a long time before that happens).\n",

We had a corner room (823), which had two delightful decks with jaw dropping views of the Acropolis.  Unfortunately it rained for most of the time during our stay but watching a long and violent lightening storm one evening over the Acropolis from the warmth of our bed was a very memorable experience.

Despite repeated requests to fix it, nothing happened. The windows in our room were poorly fitted (we were on the corner) and there was quite a lot of street noise. And the key card never worked, even when we kept it separate from phones and other cards. We wasted a lot of time in a reception queue waiting to get a new key, complaining with the other guests waiting for the same reason. And the cost of hotel babysitting was outrageous.

This room had a full-on view of building rooftops with age-old equipment, chimneys and other assorted old equipment and you had to lean over the balcony railing to see a glimpse of the Acropolis in the far-off distance.  Also, the \"double bed\" was too small for me and my husband -- it really IS a very small bed by U.S. standards.  I highly recommend asking the hotel to push two twin beds together to resemble a king-size bed.  Otherwise, you'll be falling out of bed during the night if your spouse or significant other turns over.  No way is this a 5-star hotel!   We've stayed at other properties in Athens…\n",

My room was nicely appointed and spacious. It was also very quiet. I cannot fault the room.  Most of the staff I encountered were pleasant, but none overly so. I actually found some staff members quite distant, actually cold. Shame. I did not expect this as every where else I went in Athens the people I encountered were very friendly.   The main feature of the hotel is the lovely rooftop. After you get over the really RUDE greeting from the hostess the views from here are unforgettable. While having lunch, I could not focus on my food because of the views. Have the Greek Mountain Pomegranate Ice Tea…\n",

Chris at reception happily checked us in and repeated everything we needed to know over and over again with the utmost patience. Stavos was ready with our bags to go upstairs and patiently waiting for us to get ourselves together. We stopped for a quick drink at the bar downstairs where Kill Bill Vasillis was fantastic and friendly to the 80 year old gay couple I was traveling with, and the vibrant red haired  Angela and the birthday girl Fay greeted us and made my friends feel at home. After taking a shower we headed up to the roof top deck for the best drink we had in our 9 days in Greece so far crafted by Chris the upstairs bartender, which quickly turned into more than one.…\n",

The rooftop pool is also very nice and pool drink service is right there. Hotel is right in top shopping area, 2 blocks from changing of the guard. 4 blocks to placka.

The entrance and public areas on the ground floor are small and not that inviting.  More importantly, the bedrooms are a good size, spotlessly clean, comfortable, good storage with good bathrooms.  Breakfast on the top floor is good.  There's masses of choice and quality is good.  There is a small pool on the top floor.  There were always sunbeds available.  The views from the restaurant and pool is fabulous.  Service is good.  This is a very good hotel, but for the star rating and price it doesn't exceed expectations.  Recommended.\n",

The rooms were very comfortable and rather larger by European standards.  There was a lot of storage for our things.    The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioner worked great.    The included breakfast had many options and the views of the Acropolis from the restaurant were amazing - both daytime views and nighttime views.   The staff at this hotel is very accommodating and they were able to assist us with most of our requests.    The location of this hotel was at the entrance to the Plaka so it was easy to get around and eat, shop, explore.    I highly recommend this hotel for a short stay in Athens.\n",

Not much seating but I was less interested in a sun deck.   They also have an indoor pool and spa in the basement along with a small gym. It is in a great location and easy to walk to all major tourist sites. Good restaurants nearby. Our room came with an included buffet breakfast which was sumptuous. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a laundromat 2 blocks away. Our room was on the 2nd floor - meaning 2 flights up (or 3rd floor in US) so it was easy to take the stairs down to the lobby.

When checked in the only room available was right by the staff room and next to the elevators, so when tried to rest after an international flight, felt like we were in the hallway. When I tried to ask to change rooms I was told that everything was booked.. so I guess making reservation that far in advance doesn’t guarantee you the same quality room as for someone who just happened to check in earlier?

From the moment our taxi pulled in, to the morning we checked out, the service was exceptional. Bellhops, bartenders, concierge clerks, servers and housekeeping all went out of their way to ensure our stay was phenomenal. As with Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons properties, service at Electra Metropolis is a culture that extends far beyond a job. When we checked in four our second 2-night stay, the reception desk was buzzing with staff working feverishly to accommodate a line of a dozen new guests. We were exhausted from our flight (and clearly everyone else was, too). In such a situation, an ordinary hotel’s reception staff might be as warm as a cut-rate car…\n",

The rooftop bar restaurant has spectacular views, but the service received from the staff was poor.  They provide you with initial service, then disappear. It was so bad, that we left and went to the Grande Bretagne for dinner as we were totally ignored on the evening of July 30, 2019 during our stay.  There is NO PARKING on site.  You need to find your own parking which is difficult in that area.

Since its opening 3 years ago, I go at least once per summer if not more often.   Sadly, however, this year’s experience was literally ruined by the poor service.  Although neither the restaurant nor the bar area were overly busy, there was no way to get the attention of the many waiters and waitresses.  At some point, after trying to waive waiters and waitresses for over 10 minutes, I had to stand up and gesture for a good 3-4 minutes to get someone to notice us.   Overall, our bill was over 100 euros.  We enjoyed a beautiful bottle of some of the best Greek white wine, several other things as well, and the beautiful view.  It is really regrettable…\n",

We arrived after a 24 hour journey only to be told by reception that our reservation was not kept and the hotel was fully booked. They claimed to have emailed us that there was a problem with our payment not being received but we received no such email and cannot investigate our payment until we return home next month. The front desk staff were arrogant and completely unconcerned with our plight. They just brushed us aside. When I pushed the matter they admitted that they had a suite available but it was twice the price of our selected room. After more pleading for help they offered 20…\n",

Pros:  Breathtaking rooftop pool and eating area with astonishing view of Acropolis and expansive view of Athens.  Delicious and extensive buffet.  Great central location.  Nice view of Acropolis from suite. Other room literally faced a wall.  Great air conditioning important in 95+ Athens summer heat.  Nespresso machine.  Comfortable beds.  Cool modern decor.  Cons:  Woken up at 3:30 AM by loud hammering sound in ceiling. Called front desk who said they would tell security. Sound stopped immediately after call. Clearly they knew about this and someone was fixing something so they were not honest about what was happening.  Keys to both rooms stopped working a day…\n",

Ours was wonderful and had a delightful terrace with views onto the Acropolis. Beds were comfortable. Our sons' room was even nicer (no terrace but it did have a sitting area). The bathrooms were fantastic, especially the showers, which had enormous rain shower heads with excellent water pressure. Great bath amenities like Korres bath products and fluffy robes and towels.

The pool is small and can get crowed during the day. Spa is nice. Some staff members were outstanding, some others, a bit impatient. Breakfast time can be chaotic, be patient.

Walking into the lobby by the very tall doorman is like walking into a room of complete calm. Having disembarked from the ship around 10 AM, I arrived at the hotel well ahead of the check-in time. Fortunately for me, and you could see the change in demeanour of the young woman at the desk, when she reported that my room was ready for early check-in.

Polite and courteous staff throughout, very clean.  Only negative Unfortunately due to the size of the hotel and number of poolside beds we were never able to have any real relaxing pool time.

In fact, only two corner suites are worth the premium you'll pay for the view. We made a point of noting which those rooms are so that if we decide to stay here again, we would book our reservations directly with the hotel and specifically ask for one of those two rooms.The staff is cordial, professional and will attempt to satisfy all your requests.

This is as luxurious as the Electra Plaka and equally central as the Electra at Ermou str/ Syntagma sq. The multistorried previously Ministry of Education and Relious Affairs has been fully renovated and impresses with its vast lobby and classy decoration. It even brands a centuries old church right outside the main entrance (the enormous building has engulfed the tiny church and was previously criticized for that). Top floor restaurant and bar offers stunning views of the Acropolis.

The rooftop is just beautiful but then again service is poor. The staff will avoid eye contact. They won’t come ask you if you need another drink or anything....... maybe I am spoilt by service one is used to in the US.

We had a bad experience from the moment we booked through checkin and our entire stay. Our room looked strait into someone elses apartment which didnt help (and so would anyone staying on most floors given the surrounding buildings except the highest ones), but also he staff werent the greatest and the room was dated, breakfast was average and generally it just wasnt a good place to stay.

Tons of restaurants, cafes, shopping areas and historical landmarks are nearby.  The view of the Acropolis from the restaurant, both day and night is incredible. Its the type of view that you can never get sick of. I had my breakfast there in the mornings and drinks during the evening. The drink menu is pretty good.    The rooms are spacious and cleaned well. It was a quite comfortable stay. The overall decor of the hotel was pretty cool and trendy, without overdoing it.  The spa was just ok. But to be honest, I'm a spa snob. So it takes an awful lot to get a solid 2 thumbs up for a spa from me.  The staff were great! When I checked in, I realized that I left my phone in…\n",

Without exaggeration, this was the absolute worst customer service in a hotel I’ve ever experienced. Upon check in, there was confusion about my guest’s name being on the reservation despite me being the one who made the booking with my credit card and presenting ID on check in. The front desk clerk refused to check me in until I removed my guest’s name from the reservation on booking.com (even though I explained that she wasn’t flying in for another 2 days) and he refused to help me do this, telling me I needed to go online on my phone right there to do it. After I did this, he then told me my room would…\n",

The bed was very comfortable. Location for the hotel was key and best part, you could walk anywhere. The buffet breakfast was okay. Lots of options, but nothing special. It was free so that is why we used it and the views from the roof are amazing! Would recommend based on location and very safe, clean hotel.

      "Review is :Third time at the hotel and it gets better every time. The hotel is very convenient and central to the city. It was busy but coped well with my early morning arrival and late night departure. The rooms are well set up for the business traveller. Plenty of light. Small balcony and can open windows for fresh air. Reliable internet. The desk chair was too low so the hotel arranged an adjustable office chair for me to be able to work in the room. The bathroom is well appointed, modern and functional. The housekeeping staff are invariably polite and thorough. Overall, I find the staff consistently demonstrates that nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast continues to be outstanding and the Acropolis views superb. Congratulations.\n",

I explained he was in the air but they shrugged and said there was nothing they could do, so my long awaited shower was still hours away... Finally when he arrived I was allowed into the room.

The view from the hotel restaurant at the top is probably one of the best views in town on the Acropolis.  The roof swimming pool was closed in winter (not heated) but there is also a small swimming pool in the basement, with sauna etc.  Communal areas were also well decorated and spotless.  Hotel staff were very polite and helpful.  Included buffet breakfast had a large range of cold and cooked choices.

Breakfast was delicious with a wide selection available, and is on the 10th floor with absolutely stunning acropolis views. We also enjoyed a delicious meal in the restaurant on our last night. It isn't cheap but I don't think the views can be as good anywhere else in the city. The spa was small with only 4 loungers but luckily was not busy during our trip in January so we were able to enjoy the facilities after long days of exploring. Staff were friendly and attentive throughout our stay. We would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Our rooms overlooked the Acropolis, which we fell asleep and awoke to each day.  It was my son’s first trip to Athens, and this view, while expensive, permeated our visit and provided an ambience and sensitivity to the splendor of the ancient city that was priceless. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the rooms are sound proofed and extremely quiet.  Every night produced a long and satisfying slumber after  long days of walking the city. The breakfast spread each morning in the rooftop restaurant was an amazing feast.  There was no breakfast choice missing in the entire spread that I could see. From…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at this hotel at the end of our Greek holiday, primarily for its proximity to the Acropolis and centre of town. It literally is about 300m away from the Greek parliament, and right in the heart of the shopping district making it easy access to the old town and a brisk walk to the Acropolis.  The hotel is classed as high 4*, the restaurant at the top is very nice and the breakfast was great, with awesome views over the concrete jungle of Athens. Service was good.  Both the indoor and outdoor pool were very good.  We opted for the half board option and in hindsight this probably wasn’t the best choice, as the range for dinner was restricted and we sat in ‘The Library’ rather than any of the others in the hotel.  The room was very clean and large, the bathroom was…\n",

      "Review is :This is absolutely the best place in Athens to stay.  You are right next to the Parliament (Syntagma Square) building where the  changing of the guard happens. The best part of this hotel is the views of the Acropolis. BREATHTAKING. The pictures on their website capture it perfectly. To sit out in the morning as you get your day started with breakfast or to have a nightcap in the evening, it couldn’t have gotten any better than that. The second best part about the location is that you are in the heart of shopping and dining. It’s within walking distance to so many options.   The hotel itself is very modern and clean. I was PLEASANTLY surprised! One thing, you must insert your key into a master switch on the wall right when you enter the room to get the lights to turn on! Haha!…\n",

On our second stay, we had a very serviceable room on third floor.   Service was great from easy check in to check out.  The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet for sleeping.  The rooms were cleaned in a very timely fashion and getting extra pillows was no problem. The breakfast was very good.  I will mention one thing that was a total negative to me.  We were asked if we wanted to eat inside or outside.  Hubby said inside and I said outside. I won BUT such a huge mistake.   Keep in mind that I love all animals.

We were lucky to grab a table on the outside terrace and enjoy our meal.  Even that early in the morning you could see the crowds already at the site.

Everything about it is outstanding including the decor, staff, rooms, food, and the fantastic city views from the 10th floor dinning/bar area.  It is centrally located and has all the bells and whistle you will need for a wonderful stay in Athens.  It was our last hotel while in Greece and definitely our best hotel during our 11 day stay where we visited from Thessaloniki, Corfu, Olympia, etc., to Athens.  This hotel almost made me forget the excruciating plane ride back to JFK  bearable.\n",

It was on the corner in the back of the hotel and it was quiet.  The second floor offers no view, so if you have hopes of seeing the Acropolis from your room go up, way up probably seven but eight or nine would be better.  The breakfast on the tenth floor offers a great view.  We bought the breakfast on our arrival day for 25 euro each.  It was not bad that day but still a bit pricey.  The breakfast was better on the weekend than it was on Monday.  Monday it was a poor offering and although they say it is open until 11:00 at 10:45 they were well into dismantling the buffet.  The restaurant in the same area on the tenth floor was pretty good and the view…\n",

The guestroom was spacious with the view to the side street. The bathroom had a large shower glass cubicle with built in slab to sit on while enjoying the rain shower. The bed was comfortable, I fell to sleep in minutes each evening.  The first morning at breakfast, the view to Acropolis was breathtaking.

On Sundays the full dress-uniform, marching band version takes place and well worth a look.  The hotel is a short walk from some excellent locations in Athens, very convenient and very central.  The gym is reasonable for a city centre location, and the spa facilities are very good.    Breakfast with a view of the temple is a real highlight and one of the best starts to a day in Athens you could hope for.  We'll definitely go back.\n",

First off, this was NOT what I’d consider an Acropolis view room- you literally had a view of the jenky building next door and if you wanted to see the Acropolis you had to go out on the balcony and hang your head off the end of the balcony to see it. Very disappointing. Also, we could hear literally EVERYTHING from the restaurant two floors above until 1230/1am and again at 6/630am. The vibrations from the restaurant moving chairs around and the clanking of dishes made it so we had a very hard time falling asleep and then were woken up very early.

      "Review is :The location was great just two blocks from Syntagma Square. Plaka was behind hotel. The lobby of the hote hadl two unique works of art. The first is a unique work by Greek painter Alekos Fasianos showing silver bees soaring in the blue Greek sky, and other is a composition of marble plaques. Beside the basement had the remains of the famous Themistoclean wall which surrounded ancient Athens. Finally the 16th century Agia Dynami chapel on ground floor is part of hotel building. The reception staff was nice enough to give us an early check-in. The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. The balcony on 8th floor had stunning view of famous Acropolis. Within a walking distance from hotel there were hundreds of restaurants, bars, shops, malls and all important attractions of…\n",

The start and end of the tour were very close to our hotel. We were just a block from the Plaka and from some amazing restaurants. Our hotel looked directly at the Acropolis from the rooftop bar and restaurant  The only transportation we needed to take was to and from the airport and sea port\n",

It was indeed a good choice, good service from friendly/ professional staff. Room was nice and cool even when the air conditioning is not on with comfortable beds. The roof top bar/restaurant has a beautiful view of Athens and the Acropolis. Breakfast was nice, a bit cold though. Location is great, it is close to bars, restaurants, museums, shopping etc. Overall it was a great experience for us and I will certainly stay there again. I definitely recommend this hotel.\n",

The roof top restaurant and bar offers a great view of the Acropolis.  A good selection at breakfast, however, the food were all the same during my few nights stay.  The only reason why I have marked this hotel down is because of some very minor issues.  The mini bar was not refilled on my arrival. I was charged for few items which the previous guests had, however, staff was very courteous and taken the items off at check out.

The other direction , a couple blocks away, is syntagma square.The hotel is clean, the rooms an average size and very modern and minimalist. The view from the restaurant is fabulous, straight the Acropolis. You eat there for breakfast, so that's a bonus.  The pool is funny, right next to the restaurant so you can see people in there, plus quite small. If you're very hot though, after sit seeing, I'm sure it does the trick.  Staff were very friendly and service was great. They directed us to a very non touristy area that as little \"hipster\". I'd not seen that area before.  Unfortunately we booked last minute and that was reflected in the price. or what we paid, I didn't think…\n",

There is a Library Bistro Cafe located next to the lobby where you can have a casual meal or opt for an authentic Greek meal.

So after dinner we went down to the front desk to schedule a wake up call at 6am Ug..  Once we were downstairs we notice people coming in from the streets having fun.

It is located very near the Plaka neighborhood, and is very close to many of the major city attractions including the Acropolis and the Agora.  The top floor of the hotel is where breakfast is served, an absolutely stunning array of food with great variety.  But even more important is the breathtaking view of the Acropolis from this 10th floor.  It is also highly recommended to have at least one dinner meal at this rooftop location - an opportunity to see the setting of the sun, and the eventual nighttime illumination of the Acropolis and the surrounding neighborhood.  The rooms are very well appointed, with comfortable beds, and very good wifi service.    Also even though the fitness center has limited…\n",

This was in part because of the very friendly and attentive staff (nothing was too much trouble). But also because of the high standard and variations of food available.  There were two small negatives though: 1. On arrival we were insistently told that we did not have a booking. This is despite the staff member having my full name and confirmation number from the booking site. This was a very unsettling and upsetting welcome 2. The shower leaked, continually.

It’s also close to several good cafes and restaurants. Breakfast is on the rooftop with a spectacular view of the Acropolis - have dinner up there one night because the sunset and the Acropolis with lights is stunning. I would definitely stay here again if ever in Athens.\n",

Queen bed was comfortable.  Sofa bed not so much.   AC worked.  Bathroom very spacious. Honestly,  i spent more time hanging out in the lounge than the room.   You can take a train from the airport,  i think it was about 15 stops so grab a seat. They are located outside train stop. you can just walk out and do about a 5-10 minute walk.  Shopping is located adjacently.   about 15 minute walk to the main area of eatery's.

No where its explained that you are buying the cheapest room in the house or that it doesn't have any view. Management are rude instead of apologising. Service is not good in general overall. Went to the pool at 7pm and I was told that it was close at 7pm with a big smile. While the sun during summer in Athen still shinning until 830 pm.

There are many restaurants and shops around the hotel, and it is an easy walk to the Acropolis.   We did not have a view from our room as I assume is true for most rooms, but you can make up for that by having breakfast/drink /dinner on the 10th floor roof garden, where an amazing view of the acropolis and surround area awaits you.  While we did not have dinner on the 10th floor, we did enjoy the breakfast, a buffet, with eggs, cereals, fruits, and pastries, along with cheese, yoghurt and lovely breads. A wonderful way to start a day of sightseeing!  Highly recommend the Electra Metropolis.\n",

Just outside of your door there are many choices for dining and shopping.  The hotel has a wonderful restaurant and bar on the tenth floor, overlooking the Acropolis. Stunning views. We ended our day there for a bottle of wine each day.  We only had breakfast at the hotel, but it was a very good buffet with more than enough choices to satisfy most people.  Speaking of people, the staff of this hotel know how to treat their guests. Service is very good. Pleasant helpful,professional .  Our room was lovely.

The hotel staff were very professional helping with several reservations for shows and tours as well as making great dinner recommendations.

As with most hotels they give you a heavy duvet in the hottest point in summer. Something that baffles me. One is forced to turn up the air conditioning because the duvet make you so warm.

The room we had was very dark, the only window available was internally facing and we couldn't open it due to privacy issues.  The roof top view was really nice, having breakfast and/or dinner there is lovely and the food served very tasty.  The main problem with this hotel is the service they provide, which is very far from being 5 star.  When we checked-in there were three people behind the desk, only the trainee greeted us and processed the checkin flawlessly, while the two receptionists didn't even make eye contact and carried out talking to each other in greek, which was very rude (!)  Every time we left or we entered the lobby, the reception personnel didn't acknowledge us.   Inconsistent room turn down service,…\n",

The shower was huge but it kept leaking out into the bathroom.  As you need to keep your key in the slot, it took a while for the room to cool down with the ac.  The elevators are tiny compared to North American elevators so sometimes it felt claustrophobic with too many people in.  The pool is on the 10th floor but it is tiny.

The bathroom was new and clean, but the shower was in the tub creating a large step over. There are only a very few high floor rooms with an Acropolis view. Book early and ask how much the upgrade costs.  The restaurant is on the 10th floor. You walk by a glass sided swimming pool to enter the roof top restaurant. Boom it hits you.

The most humiliating experience unfolded tonight in their 10th floor flagship restaurant, which does have an amazing view, not by the young Maitre D who was a welcoming young lady, but by the wait staff who deposited me in the farthest corner of the restaurant, and left me there.

      "Review is :We stayed there for 2 pre-cruise nights and were happy with our choice.  I had booked another hotel ranked higher on TA but changed to Electra Metropolis for the rooftop view.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The location turned out to be excellent too - even better than I had expected.  There's a lot to do nearby with a good selection of eateries, shopping and attractions.  We walked everywhere - Acropolis, Plaka, Kolonaki etc.  I like that it's close to Syntamag Square but not right there on the main streets.  Breakfast on 10th floor each morning offered a great view of the Acropolis and panorama of other parts of Athens.  The spread was good (by European standards) and service was friendly.  In general, all hotel staff I've interacted with were courteous and helpful  The hotel is…\n",

The staff was friendly and eager to help in anyway that they could. They pointed us in right direction more than once. Our room was spacious for 2 people, even though we were hardly ever there. It was pricey but you get what you pay for.  This hotel is in the best location. You can leave in any direction and find one of the many sights Athens happens to offer.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, safe and centrally located place to stay while in Athens.\n",

      "Review is :My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights for our honeymoon mid-May. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and is in a perfect location for site seeing in Athens.   There were a few issues though and that's why I cannot give them 5 stars. We checked in on a Sunday and I don't know if that has anything to do with our experience? We booked the hotel through a package with costco and our package was supposed to come with a bottle of champagne and fruit in our room upon our arrival, and 2 drinks at the hotel bar. When we entered our room there was no champagne or fruit. So we called and it literally took room service 4(!) tries to get this package correct!! They first came up with a basket of fruit- apples, pears, bananas- felt bizarre but we took it and asked if they were going to…\n",

Breakfast was served on the rooftop terrace overlooking Acropolis. What a wow it was each morning! They served a wide selection of your typical fare as well as some Greek specialities. Service was always very prompt and polite.  However, the best feature of the hotel has to be the central location, a few steps from the Syntagma square and a short walk to the old town, Plaka, with its restaurants. All major sights including Acropolis and both Agoras are also within an easy walk.  Oh, and the pool! I loved swimming a few laps and relaxing by the pool after a hard day of sightseeing, sipping a well-deserved Aperol Spritz!\n",

We were greeted warmly with a handshake and every single member of staff from the front desk, lobby staff and room service were friendly and went out of their way to help us (even if it was pushing our lift button and just asking about our day). One women  even congratulated us on our honeymoon in the lift so clearly they keep an excellent record of guests as we had not told her. We were also welcomed with wine and a to die for chocolate mouse cake in our room.  In terms of facilities the rooms are extremely spacious (we had a basic room) and the bathroom was huge.

The bell boy was also helpful because when he delivered our bags to our door, he gave us a tour of the room and explained to us how things in Europe worked. We had an amazing balcony view of the of the Acropolis which paired nicely with the complimentary champagne they gave us for our honeymoon!  The hotel is very clean, functional, and comes with cool toiletries.  A bonus is that the hotel is in the very center of where you want to be.  Walking distance to all the restaurants and shops.

It has a nice top floor terrace overlooking Acropolis, perfect setting for serving breakfast or a happy hour.  Breakfast is satisfactory, service is good and the hotel is clean.  From the hotel you may reach most of touristic sights (Plaka, parliament, Acropolis) walking. And you have plenty of restaurants and shops around.\n",

Also, although taxis are available 24 hours a day (which the desk clerks will confirm), the bell hops (who obviously have a side deal to make extra money) like to get you \"specially ordered\" more expensive limos, and if you do not order one on leaving the hotel, they suddenly do not want to help with your luggage.\n",

Breakfast was excellent--many choices.    Also has a nice small pool.  Gives you a wonderful sense of Athens.      This hotel is not cheap but if you are staying in Athens for only a night or two it is worth it to binge a bit and stay here.  Hotel has perfect location near all the tourist sites as well as many wonderful restaurants.  I had a 3 floor room that was very nice but had no view.  If you want a view get a higher floor room and ask for view of the Acropolis.  Wifi was great.  Service was wonderful.

As there are no such properties in Athens, I rolled the dice with the Electra family and struck gold with the Metropolis, newly constructed and perfectly situated in central Athens.  You never know what you will get with European five-stars (see my review of the amazing shed-like bathroom in Rome). The Metropolis exceeds expectations in all key areas. The rooms are new with comfortable beds, ample storage and modern well layed out bathrooms. Even my least expensive rooms featured a large walk-in shower with high rain forest head and stone seat. Think you don't need a seat? Hike up and down Lycabettus and reconsider. No shower yoga with low, dangling, wall-mounted swivels required here. Counter space,…\n",

It is also a short walk to the hop-on-hop-off bus stop, which is a great way to see Athens.  The staff are very good. They are all pleasant and helpful.

The only real downside is the \"Library\" dining room - while folks were nice the food was really (truly) dreadful - apart from the bread (AKA \"apart from that Mrs. Lincoln how was the play\").  Ourrecommendation would be NOT to eat there - some very good places nearby (don't use place across street - MOMA a couple of blocks down street is fantastic!\n",

Everything was 5 stars - the rooms, the breakfast, the pools etc. but outstanding was the helpfulness of the staff. We had sent an e-mail requesting a shower rather than tub. Upon arrival when we learned we had a tub Ianna at reception worked the computer until she was able to arrange a room with a freestandning shower. When we checked out we were asked to pay for a water from the minibar. Our explanation that we had put our own water bottle (with a similar look) into the minibar and we did not use the hotel's water, was readily accepted without argument.

The staff, at all times, were friendly, helpful and happy to deal with any enquiry.  The Hotel is spotless...   daily housekeeping is not intrusive and extremely prompt.The 10th floor restaurant provides a wonderful dining experience along with what can only be described as a truly amazing view of the Acropolis... this view can also be appreciated at breakfast. What a way to start your day!! The Library restaurant on the ground floor offers a different dining experience but the standard is still good.

Breakfast was comprised of various options, as we sat down every morning, we enjoyed a flawless view of the Acropolis. Staff were friendly, and spoke very good English.

It is too small; not enough light and way too cramped with machines and weights squashed in.

      "Review is :I’ve stayed here a couple of times when in Athens and it is by far the best place I’ve stayed in the City. It’s a lovely hotel with a luxurious feel. For a large hotel it doesn’t have a bland corporate feel either as hotels often can. The rooms are lovely. Breakfast is fab. Rooftop pool is great. And the views from the roof are unbeatable. If I had to pick any fault I would say that the restaurant is quite over priced and didn’t tempt me at all despite the view, I chose to eat across the road (which was lovely and a lot cheaper). That said the location is great so huge amount of food options nearby. For access to all the historical sights and the shopping area this place can’t be beaten. This place is def my first choice for Athens!\n",

A lot of noise in and outside of the room(coming propably from the air circulation fans) and bad control of the air condition and smelly air in the room! We asked to change and fortunately the room on the 4th was nice. The hotel is located in the bustling city centre and there are lots of great bars and restaurants(whatever kind of food) nearby. May be the top attraction is the rooftop bar -restaurant where you can enjoy most breakfast -lunch-dinner-drinks with  spectacular view of Athens and the Akropolis.\n",

Rooms were well appointed, excellent king beds, terrific showers and bath. It cost more but for us the high floor rooms with Acropolis views were worth the extra money. The rooftop was a highlight, with restaurant, bar, pool. There is interior and exterior restaurant sitting. I think the same menu but the feeling totally different. Inside has views of the Acropolis but sitting outside is where it's at - tables were for 2 or 4 outside, larger groups sat inside. Extensive breakfast buffet in the mornings. Nothing like watching the sunrise over Athens and the Acropolis over your eggs. You may have to wait…\n",

Every night you can see the well lit acropolis sitting just across. This room is a must to see new year fireworks. The room is actually a bedroom plus a small living room. Size wise is pretty ok. The balcony is big though. So the suite, you get a living room with sofas and TV, a nice bedroom with TV and bathroom. The amenities is pretty standard. The bed is nice and comfy.

Room was large and comfortable, staff were all very friendly and helpful and the views from the roof top bar and restaurant were stunning. After dumping our bags we headed up to the roof top bar for a few cocktails and to watch the sun go down, an amazing way to spend a few hours. Seeing the sky change from blue to black and watching the Acropolis light up in front of us was an experience not to be missed. Drinks in the bar were reasonably priced given the location. We ate in the restaurant that night, go for an outside table if you can. Food looked lovely but was slightly disappointing when it came to flavour. We ate…\n",

Close to a 5 Star though.  Great roof top restaurant for lunch and dinner and the bar.  Bar tenders are friendly.  Excellent view of the Acropolis from the roof top restaurant.  They say €12 per day for the Valet.  One of the reasons this is not quite a 5 Star is that it’s really a Self Park that’s 2 blocks away at the Electra Athens Hotel.  The fact that they advertise it as valet knocks it out of the top tier hotels.  But, all in all nice hotel for the money.\n",

Only negative was the horrible coffee and the breakfast in general....no way a 5 star standard. My husband asked for an omelette one morning to be rudely told there was omelette on the buffet.

      "Review is :We had a truly excellent stay at the Electra Metropolis.  The location is perfect for visiting all the major sites in Athens.  It's steps from Syntagma square, the Plaka, and the Acropolis.  We took the bus from the Athens airport (as the metro was on strike) to Syntagma square - we walked to the hotel as it was only about 2 blocks from the airport bus stop.    We had a room that had a view of the Acropolis - but not quite as good as the rooftop pool, bar, and restaurant where breakfast was served.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic especially with the fantastic view.   The service was excellent from check in to check out.  The hotel also arranged a mini-van for our group of 6 to the port in Piraeus.  It really made our transfer both efficient and reasonably priced.  I can't…\n",

They charged me a whole stay for 3 nights full amount from 14/11/2017 till 17/11/2017, i had a delay in the flight and didnt come at the 14th, i came on the 16th early morning to figure out they cancelled the reservation without getting back to me. I didnt them for refund or anything inwas asking for my right to take this night the 16th which i already paid it full amount by the credit card.

      "Review is :Just returned from a business trip with an extra three days tagged on for leisure.  This is a new hotel with old style service.  The restaurant has an amazing view of the Parthenon, with excellent food as an added bonus, served by friendly and efficient staff.  The rooms are large and comfortable. The public areas have buzzy and quiet parts, which is great when you may want a quiet nook to read or work.  Wi fit is free and fast.  The only slight minus is the gym, which is small and overcrowded with equipment, such that if one person is using one piece of equipment, there is no space for another to use another piece with any comfort.  There simply isn’t enough room for a gym AND a (small) pool, and a choice should have been made for one or the other.  This must not put you off…\n",

We had the views of the Acropolis.  highly recommend this as in the evenings it is sensational.  if not from the room, then the roof top has the same sensational views.  Room was 5-star in quality and cleanliness it is not a 'refurbuished' hotel as this hotel was completely gutted and refitted achieving apparently a US Green Star award, the only in Athens, and used to be the Ministry of Education according to the coffee table book.  It is amazingly centrally located on Mitrepoleous Street which takes you in a short 500m walk to the Plaka and Monastraki Square.  It is parallel to Ermou St the shopping strip, and next to Syntagma Square.  Awesome location and great service…\n",

We were really pleased with the room size, very spacious, which is unusual for European hotels. Decor was done tastefully, and the bed was comfy. The rooftop bar and restaurant was great for morning breakfast and evening drinks, with amazing views of the acropolis. The staff at the bar were so nice, served us drinks on the house when they heard it was our last night in Europe before we headed back home. It is the little things that make all the difference. :) Note:  I posted this review on booking.com, now sharing here as well.\n",

Do yourself a favor and visit the bar or pool after sunset, to enjoy this beautiful view  Breakfast had a good variety, food tasted good.  The hotel is well centered, and within walking distance to shopping streets and transportation.  All in all, a great place. If I will visit Athens again, I will definitely try booking at this hotel.

Its a real shame when a great hotel overall just takes it a bit too far in terms of charging too much for basic services.

As a bonus, hotel management recognized our recent nuptials with a complimentary bottle of some and dessert. The only reason we did not rate this hotel at a 5 is due to their breakfast. The food was bland, and did not taste as fresh as the breakfast food of other hotels in Greece we 2habe visited or offer as much variety.\n",

The rooftop restaurant has an unbelievable view of the Parthenon both in the day during the included breakfast and in the evening. Our dinner at the rooftop restaurant was outstanding as was the service. The pool is beautiful too. Our room was spacious for a city hotel with a modern bathroom.  The location was ideal as we were able to walk everywhere and get the vibe of the city. We would definitely stay there again!\n",

We walked to all the sights we wanted to see with the exception of the National Archaeological Museum. The pool was also excellent – you can actually see the Acropolis from the water which is a claim that I doubt many hotels can promise (including the Grand Bretagne where we also stayed!). On the pool though, get a lounger in the early afternoon or you will miss out entirely. The room was also spacious: we had a third bed for our son and even with that addition all our luggage fit well and there was enough walking around room. Complaints? Not many but you do have to push to get a view table at breakfast. It just seemed like it was easier for them to sit you inside as they tried…\n",

The first night we had drinks at the bar, which was great, then had dinner in their dining room looking out over the Acropolis. The view was to die for but we felt that the dining room staff were very cold and did not have a lot to offer. It was like' I have a job to do' and that was it. We couldn't wait to leave!! The next night we went up to the bar again and I must say the men working in the bar were fabulous. We decided not to go to the dining room again for the rest of our stay. Breakfasts were very good and these were included in the tariff. I can recommend the hotel but can't recommend the dining room\n",

Then I asked for the hotel to move my booking from Saturday night to Sunday night after we rebooked our flight home, but I was also declined.  Basically, this hotel has my money and can resell the room to make additional money.  Obviously, I will never stay at this hotel or any other \"Electra\" hotels or recommend the hotel chain to friends.\n",

They have breakfast included which is good not outstanding.  The rooms are very normal.  The size is as you would expect as is decor and amenities.

The only problem we had was, we made the booking 6 months in advance and said \"double bed\" when we checked in I asked and the room was set up with two singles pushed together which we all know is not the same. All other rooms with a double or queen bed were booked out.  The receptionist did arrange for house keeping to come up straight away and put a mattress topper on making it a double bed which really was fantastic service. The roof top pool was AMAZING!! spent hours up there getting drinks and dipping into a great temperature pool! We will be staying here again.\n",

The rooms we stayed in on both occasions in the third and fifth floors had no view whatsoever ( another building very close by). The first night we asked for an extension of two hours on the check out time and the reception's short undiplomatic answer was \" we give you til twelve thirty, one minute after one you pay half day\" Breakfast location nice but at 10 a.m many plates e.g hams, cheeses were empty.

Gym facility was a tiny room with very minimal equipment. Hairdryer fizzled out after 1st minute. No turndown service either night of our 2 night stay.

We were able to walk easily from the hotel to the Acropolis (and Museum) as well as to Plaka and Monastiraki.  We had room 823 and found it to be fantastic.  It's a corner room and has views of the Parthenon not only from your bedroom but from either of the two terraces.  The included buffet was of a good standard and the staff managed the morning rush very capably.  The staff were very helpful in finding a item of clothing that we had left behind and holding it for us until our return visit.

The rooftop pool and bar has a stunning vista of the acropolis that you would pay an entrance fee anyway to visit. And you eat breakfast here every day!   The staff are wonderful. Polite, helpful, but otherwise unobtrusive.   However, what you're really paying for is the location. It's absolutely perfect. It's a fifteen minute walk in any direction to all the sights, bars, restaurants, and delights of Athens.   When we return to Athens we will be staying here, and I would recommend it to all my friends and family.\n",

The hotel is very new and therefore has lots of great amenities and was spotlessly clean. We were happy to find a bunch of charging ports and a beautiful shower after staying in villa/airbnb type places for two weeks before!  Breakfast was a highlight with one of the best buffets we experienced on our trip and an amazing view. We wish we could have lounged by the pool more, as that was wonderful as well.  The location was great, close to the Acropolis as well as the trendy areas for shopping, eating, and drinking. Hope to return to Athens and stay here again.\n",

Lots of cafes, restaurants and shopping within a few steps of the hotel Breakfast can be improved with a larger selection and an egg station. Also there was no coffee/tea facility in the room but I guess there is no lack of cafes just stepping out of the lobby Highly recommended for a city historic visit.\n",

While the hotel is conveniently located and the rooms modern, the service here needs a step up. We took a cab from the airport and had an amazing cab driver who gave us all sorts of history about the city. She let us out on the corner of the hotel and blocked the street for about 10 seconds. The doorman came put and started yelling at her before offering to help us with our bags, then went on to rant and rave about how unprofessional she was before greeting us. It left a sour taste in my mouth. Even if he felt that way, that isn't how I want to be treated in a new city I paid a lot of money to stay at a nice hotel in. Later, we…\n",

It's a new hotel with a beautiful rooftop watching the amazing Acropolis. Great drinks and nice food. Rooms are nice and comfortable. The only down side is that the swimming pool is small but beautiful for a city center hotel.  I'll be back for sure.\n",

When we were driving to the hotel in a taxi we asked our driver for some things to do in Athens. He showed us different trips that we could book through the taxi company. We decided on one and booked it, however a day later we received an email stating that we could not book the trip. The reasoning for this was that this taxi company has a contract with the hotel that doesn't allow them to provide trips for its guests. We were then told by the rather unfriendly staff of the hotel that we had to book with their company for the same trip at a 30% markup.

Got a prepaid SIM card with 200 local minutes and 10gb of data from the cosmote store just next door for 17€ on a summer promo.  Room on 3rd floor was modern and clean. Quite a bit of water would leak from shower onto bathroom floor through the shower door. Minor issue, no other complaints.  Beautiful pool area on the rooftop but not a lot of seating. View of acropolis is obstructed from pool area but view is excellent throughout most of the restaurant.\n",

Our classic room was more than spacious with a generously sized bathroom as well.  We went up to the rooftop our first night to lay by the loungers and were really impressed with the gorgeous view of the Acropolis all lit up. When we returned the next morning for breakfast it was an equally stunning sight.  Breakfast seemed a bit understaffed but that wasn't a problem since it is a self-serve buffet for the most part. The selection is quite lovely, with yogurt, fruits, meats, eggs, waffles, pancakes and so much more. We only needed a server for coffee and someone eventually came around.  Overall I was…\n",

So initially I was disappointed that neither hotel had availability and I \"settled\" for booking the Electra Metropolis because it was in the vicinity of the others.  Now if you ask me where to stay, I would tell you without question the Electra Metropolis. The Electra is located more in the heart of where you want to be in Athens.  Turn right out of the hotel and walk a few blocks and you are at Syntagma Square.  Turn left and you are right on the edge of Plaka's pedestrian-only streets. Keep walking down the street (Mitopoleos) and it will end at Monastiraki Square where train station and flea…\n",

We showed up with 4 passports and the man at the reception simply said you can't stay here with an attitude. He was very impatient and didn't seem like he wanted to try to help us. After talking to him for a bit, he said there's a room at another floor and checked us in. Our luggage took forever to be delivered to our room, like a good hour or so. Later this woman walks into our room without knocking on the door and says she needs to check the mini fridge. Did not say anything like I'm sorry to disturb you or I'll come back later, but simply came in and said she needs to check the fridge. After…\n",

We were rather disappointed with the breakfast service. We arrived at probably the busiest time but the staff didn't seem to be able to cope and the food was not replenished quickly enough.  Many of the dishes were empty.  We had to ask for water, milk and to have our table cleared to make room.  It let our stay at the hotel down.  However,  if time allows do have a spa treatment.  I had an Ancient Greek Massage and it was one of the best massages I've had in a long time.  Well worth finding the time for and it redeemed the hotel.\n",

From the moment we checked in, reception was very welcoming and hospitable; in particular, Nick from the front reception had a great sense of humour and chatted with us while we waited to settle the details.

Located right in the heart of the city right near Ermou, the mall it is a stone's throw to everything including the Plaka district. The architect has really nailed the design of the hotel using Greek materials including stone, marble and glass to great effect. Spaces are wide and rooms spacious. The rooftop restaurant and pool overlooking the Acropolis is brilliant. Breakfast is average but the view and setting makes up for it. The lobby is huge and the bar there is a gorgeous place to enjoy a drink before dinner. The fitness room is small, and barely sufficient but the spa is great.

But the Electra Metropolis has, from what I can recall from the others, the best-appointed rooms. Better still, despite our room being close to the elevators (why do hotels ALWAYS give me the room near the elevator unless I specifically request otherwise?), it was peaceful, which meant we all slept well.   The rooftop infinity pool is small and lacks shade, but it is gorgeous. And if it gets too hot on the roof, you can always head to the spa in the basement, and use the indoor pool there.   Looking back over our long weekend, it's hard for me to find things to criticise. They could replenish the breakfast buffet dishes more…\n",

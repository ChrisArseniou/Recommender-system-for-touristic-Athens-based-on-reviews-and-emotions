It is right by Monastiraki square and all the tourist sites. We had different rooms with balcony . Twice with partial view of the Acropolis. Rooms are not big but clean and comfortable . Hotel staff is helpful, they even arrange for a rental car to be delivered and picked up from the hotel when we went to the Meteoras. They have a nice breakfast buffet. They also have a nice rooftop bar with view of the Acropolis which is quite nice at night .\n",

Balcony was huge with view to the acropolis.  Staff really friendly and nothing too much trouble.   The location is amazing - on a really vibrant, safe street in Athens with a short walk to the square and market.  We absolutely loved it.  The roof top bar is fab for cocktails/sundowners and to soak up the atmosphere of this vibrant city. The breakfast was top notch - so much choice and plentiful. Very good value for money.  We have already booked again for next year!\n",

We were offered welcome Mastic shots (now that's a welcome drink). The room was clean and tidy with a good size bed and a nice balcony (with a view to the Acropolis). The rates were very reasonable.

The only two negative's about this hotel was that the bathrooms are very small, specifically the shower. As well as the hotel can be quite noisy at night with people talking outside of the rooms and banging the doors. Although this is inevitable in a city location.\n",

Great reception even though we arrived very late and we were delighted with our room, 606, and the incredible view of the Acropolis. Room perfectly adequate for our stay, spotless, with a very comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. Size of room as expected in a city centre hotel where space is at a premium. Breakfast was great with a good choice of hot and cold items. The rooftop bar was a delight. Can there be anything nicer than enjoying a nightcap with a stunning view? The location of this hotel is ideal for walking the city. 20 minutes to the main entrance of the Acropolis and venture off the main streets and you will find lovely squares with a choice of places to eat and drink and people…\n",

It has a grand view of the Acropolis, which is particularly stunning in the evening.  We spent time in the rooftop area often. •\tLastly, the staff at the reception desk were very helpful to us whenever we needed guidance, such as on the Metro schedule, where to get a Covid-19 test,  and even where to watch the Champion’s League final.

Since it was a short term (3 days) visit we chose Attalos because of its good location: the accomodation is close to the Monastiraki square what is a good transport hub. Additionally it is also close to the Acropolis, cca. 10 minutes walk. There are plenty of traditional restaurants around the hotel. The hotel was clean and silent. The breakfast was not so varied but suitable for a couple of days. There is a bar on the top with roof terrace with a fantastic view ot the Acropolis and the town. We were satisfied - I would come back anytime.\n",

If you fly into the airport you can take the metro directly from the airport saving expensive transfers. The hotel is clean and rooms are cleaned every day. There is a rooftop bar limited to guest which has exceptional views and provides a comfortable space for downtime. Close to lots of restaurants and walking distance to the Acropolis, Agora and markets.  Cons It’s a 3 star hotel with not a lot of amenities but again I would recommend a stay here. Shower is a pretty tight space but the water pressure and temperature was good. No in room coffee or tea, if you are an early riser there is no where to get a warm drink. Wall insulation is not great, you hear your neighbors…\n",

The rooms are modern, bright and clean. The beds are comfortable and the linens are top notch. (The towels are especially plush.). Rooms with balconies allow for smoking – but only on the balconies. The roof garden and bar are cozy and the view of the Acropolis is to die for. They also survey good breakfast at a fair price – which is also how I would describe the room pricing. There’s even a quiet sitting room with coffee and tea available.  I know that hotels and other businesses have been struggling…\n",

The location of Attalos hotel is so convenient to everything. Basically, you could walk to the Acropolis and the museum just about 15 minutes and less than 25 minutes to all the important attractions. It is also next to a metro station and you can take the metro from and to the airport. (just Euro 10 for one way) There are so many good restaurants nearby. It is also located in a safe neighborhood in the central of Athens.   Secondly, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The front desk staff, the cleaning ladies and the serving ladies in the Cafeteria were all smiling and professional. Everyone there loved to help you out.   Thirdly,…\n",

Firm, comfortable beds, quiet air conditioning, super clean room, good Wifi, olive oil toiletries, room safe, a little lounge with a library: truly lots of amenities for the price. I am torn about recommending the breakfast: wide variety of tasty Greek food, cereals, breads, fruit but oh dear, mediocre coffee and artificial orange juice. You decide if it’s worth it to you. There are plentiful coffee shops steps away. Technically our small balcony had a view of the Acropolis, but another time I think I’d save money on a basic room and go up to the roof bar for…\n",

At the edge of Psyrri, a very diverse area based around a central square with restaurants, bars, cafes and souvenir shops.  Across the street from the entrance to Monastiraki area and steps from the metro and many taxis.  The front desk will help you find whatever you're looking for.  Two modest but fast elevators so you're not waiting long.  Rooftop lounge offers drinks and nuts or 'toast' (grilled cheese sandwich), and only cheap house wine.  In Sept when i was there it was open until midnight.  I thought we'd be able to enjoy a nightcap at the hotel but instead we used it as a starting point.  Great view on one side of both Lycabettus and the Acropolis, and the other side a better view of the…\n",

It is in an excellent position, a few minutes walk from the Monastiraki metro, and within walking distance from the main attractions and restaurants.  Rooms are clean, tidy and comfortable. BreakFast is on a mezzanine level and offers a good variety of hot and cold food. The rooftop bar affords a spectacular view of the Acropolis plus beer, wine and a few snacks.  Wifi was always reliable. Staff were friendly. There was a safe for valuables and the shower was good. What more could you ask for at a reasonable price in Athens?\n",

It was very close to all the major attractions like the Acropolis, Roman Agora, Hadrian Library among other. In addition, there is a lot of good restuarant and a supermarket close to it.

We loved that it was in walking distance to absolutely EVERYTHING (Acropolis, the Plaka, restaurants etc.). I felt like I was in NYC. Restaurants open late and some open 24hrs on Fridays and Saturdays. This hotel is nothing fancy but very accommodating and comfortable.  We did the hotel breakfast the first morning and didn't any day after that. There is a great brunch place a block away with a ton of options for same price or less. The staff was okay, again, I felt like I was in NY. The rooftop bar is just that. They don't sell food, just drinks and the view of the Acropolis at night from the rooftop is pretty great!

The fantastic view of the Acropolis from our room balcony and the rooftop bar provided a very fitting and inspiring conclusion to our trip. In addition to providing that view, the hotel’s location makes exploration of the typical tourist attractions of Athens very convenient. The hotel is just a block or so from Monastiraki Square, so the Acropolis, the Ancient and Roman Agoras, Hadrian’s Library, and the Plaka neighborhood are all within easy walking distance. Our room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were all friendly and helpful. This is not a luxury hotel, but the facilities and service are very good and the location is fantastic.\n",

Well, my cab driver tried to rip me off - told me it was 80 Euro once he dropped me off.  Thanks to Attalos Hotel, I knew i was getting scammed and he ended up accepting 20 euro.

The Metro isn't scary, just watch your stuff.  Our room was basic, but modern with great AC, a comfortable bed, and a balcony that overlooked the acropolis - that was a nice surprise! Perhaps the best feature of the hotel is the amazing rooftop bar with views of the acropolis and city.  Drinks were not overly priced and they even had 2Euro ice cream for my daughter.

At reception, they provided what looked like a clear glass water jug with spigot and small cups. But, as they explained to us, it contained Mastiha, a Greek liqueur made only on Chias Island from the mastic  tree. Very tasty and a pleasant surprise! Our next stop was Hydra and we needed to get to the port. The desk arranged a taxi for us - he was right on time, spoke English and got us to the port on time.

From the hotel you can easily explore all of Athens by foot- Monastiraki, Plaka, etc. Breakfast was provided for a fee (we had secured that payment when we made our reservation) and was good and typical (breads, cheeses, meat, yogurt, etc). The room was clean and we had a private bathroom in our room. The only downside was the AC- it worked but was noisy and not very efficient, but it did cool the room down. There is also a roof deck bar with a GREAT view of the Acropolis. Would stay there again and would highly recommend!\n",

My one issue is they only give you one key for your room, which you have to hand over to reception every time you go out, and the key is needed to keep the electricity on in the room (including the air con!).  We mentioned this to reception who luckily offered us an electricity card so we could keep the air con running whilst we were out.  A little disappointed they didn't mention the card to us and that we had to ask, especially considering it was June in Athens!  Room was comfortable and clean, air con didn't stretch to the bathroom so could get a little stuffy.  We also had a balcony with lovely views of the acropolis.

I was the blonde teacher who came from Kuwait in the 1990's!  I was often on my way to Skyros Island. I miss Greece so much, the welcome is beyond any other destination and these guys are the best! Hopefully one day I will get to visit again!\n",

Great balcony for sitting in the sun or chatting in the evening with beers from the market across the street.  Only downside was the room, at some point, was a smoking room and the smell of cigarettes lingered.  Not horrible, but was noticeable.  Would stay here again\n",

Our twin room was basic and clean and had a part-view of The Acropolis from our small balcony.    The access to computers and a printer was handy to print off boarding passes.  I’d recommend this hotel over the Hermes and the Plaka hotels at which we also stayed - the Hermes as part of a tour group, and the Plaka on our return to Athens at the end of our tour, which I booked expecting a superior hotel for our last few days in Athens.  The Attalos was superior to both of those hotels and much better value.\n",

Be warned, there is no bar or refreshments until 4 pm so popping back for lunch is not an option. There is a small computer/TV room with free tea & coffee. However, the water in the flask for tea was only tepid and the 'milk' in the little tubs curdled. All channels on TV are Greek except rwo - BBC World Service and old American crime series.  But it's major selling-point is the view of the Parthenon from the roof terrace.  Get there after 4pm for drinks and a magnificant view of the Parthenon at as the sun goes down.\n",

The rear room nice and quiet, while the from room was a little nicer but had a little road noise. Both were clean and comfortable and pretty modern. The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from the Monastiraki metro and square where you can find a lot of nice dining.  The hotel entrance is easy to miss so I suggest you use google maps to familiarize yourself. The staff was very nice and helpful. There is a grocery store across the street and the rooms had a frig, so if you want cereal for breakfast you are good to go.\n",

Instead be happy about what works: bathroom is new and clean, rooms are fairly recently renovated and have a wooden floor. The rooftop bar has a great view and serves your gin tonic or local beer.  Avoid the breakfast, instead go to the hotel A for Athens nearby (15 EUR p.p. for a phantastic buffet)  The aircon is a bit tricky to operate...  ...and...125 EUR / night feels a bit on the high side in an european comparison...\n",

Their breakfast was one of the best traditional Greek breakfasts that we had during our stay in Greece - and tons of food options. They are unique in that they have the MOST beautiful roof top with an unobstructed view of the Acropolis; especially beautiful at night. They have a bar on the roof top with very reasonably priced drinks (loved the Amstel beer!). Our room was large and very clean; and updated. Shower was a little on the small side; but fine for us. It is only a 20 minute walk to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. The hotel is in the city, so its street is busy, but we heard no road noise.

Best feature was the roof-top lounge/bar with indoor and outdoor seating overlooked n=by the Acropolis. Situated a two-0minute walk from the Monastraki square and markets, it is surrounded by great restaurants and is a 12-minute walk to the Parliament Square. WE recommend that you take the one or two-day Hop On, Hop Off bus tours.  The front desk is so helpful. Will definitely be back one day at the Attalos Hotel.

The hotel seems to have upgraded some of the rooms but they are still on the small side. It was never a safe area, especially at night but it seems to have deteriorated over the 9 years since we first visited. There are more homeless on the street (some with cell phones which is hilarious). We have never opted for the breakfast, too expensive and there are better choices right nearby. Overall, I love Athens and love that the folks at the hotel remember us from prior visits but if we do make it back to Athens in the future, I will opt for another, safer location\n",

Elderly US ladies, Dutch team on a wildlife seminars, Asian newly-weds and, yes, quiet early breakfasters. Relief. Sigh.

Fresh linen after a rough and most chilly week in Eastern Dodecanese, in moist sheets and tempests, oh, such a treat ! Despite the still narrow reception space and the rather gruff male evening welcome (outbalanced by the beaming cheerful female morning welcome), still smiles, may smiles from floor to floor, such a friendly place to come back to !

The rooms are clean with comfortable beds. The furniture is basic and the bathrooms are on the small size especially the shower. The hotel has an excellent breakfast with a choice of cheese, olives, tomatoes, cucumber, local pastries,eggs, honey and yoghurt served with excellent filter coffee or herbal tea. Although there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, there is a lounge offering free tea and coffee from 11am to 4pm. You must visit the roof top bar for an amazing view of the Acropolis lit up at night!\n",

Otherwise they make great play about their breakfast but this is in my view fairly standard fare for a hotel of this type (OK but nothing to rave about).  One word of warning - before we arrived I was sent an email about a number of trips they could book for us and I asked them to book a day trip to Delphi.

Key to my interest was it’s consistently-favorable reviews on TripAdvisor, at affordable prices.  The main entrance is a bit non-descript—must be alert to spot it, especially the first time. As is apparently common in smaller hotels in Athens, there’s really no lobby at all—just a front desk. Neither of these points was important to me, so I don’t see them as issues at all.  Staff had my reservation and promptly checked me in. My room is very pleasant—apparently the entire hotel was recently renovated—including bathroom fixtures. Bedding is new and comfortable; towels and bedding seem new, thick, and plush. The place is immaculately-clean.   My booking included buffet…\n",

The hotel is conveniently located and the taxi company they recommended for an aiport transfer were friendly and efficient - no arguing about the fare and such other nonsense. The Attalos staff are competent and knowledgeable and I know my friends were happy with our choice. I can still recommend the Attalos and in fact are back in April for another Athens break.\n",

The building is older so the space for the bathroom is a bit tight in some of the rooms, but not overly so. The rooftop bar is nice and it has a great view of the Acropolis, which when lighted at night makes a phenomenal photograph to remember your stay with. I really like this place! I think they are just finishing the renovations, it looks like the 6th floor is still a work in progress as of Feb 2019. The staff really helped out when the ferry taking me to Syros got canceled twice due to gale force winds.\n",

Very close to dozens of outdoor cafes and souvenir shops. Easy walk to Syntagma Square (via Ermou) and to the ancient Agora and accessible to the Acropolis. The rooms are basic, but comfortable. We had a balcony with a view of the Acropolis, which can also be seen in a direct view from the rooftop bar. The breakfast buffet is more than adequate.

The location is great for most everything: metro without having to change lines to piraeus and airport. The Psirri nearby with its fun outdoor cafes with music and monastiraki et al also close. And the fish/meat market/agora which is always fascinating, just up the road. The rooftop view never tires and my only wish is that if music is going to be playing, how about swapping the high energy stuff for some light classical or greek bouzouki music that would be more in tone…\n",

It has a friendly 24 hour reception and a roof top bar terrace with a brilliant view of the Acropolis & Parthenon.  I was in room 607 the floor below the roof terrace and it was a basic standard room with a window (no real view) and good air con.  It was clean, quiet, with a room safe and good small bathroom with good towels.  Across the road was an excellent grill/ kebab shop (Just Pita) open to around 1.00am and a very short walk takes you to the Six Dogs bar and St Irini Square for a good evening drink.

While the location of the hotel is ideal to tourist attractions, regrettably the hotel itself is severely outdated which included the rooftop bar. It was also very noisy so if you're a light sleeper, this is not the place for you! For the $144 USD I spent, I would not recommend this location based upon my brief experience. If I was required to stay longer I would have ate the cost and changed hotels.

There are ample street eats, and a town square with a market, and activities happening well in to the late evening. You can also quickly make your way to the Parthenon early in the day when the heat is low or early evening. It is a vibrant area, and quite safe. For cheap eats you can simply cross the street and eat a gyro place where service is lovely. Plaka a quaint neighborhood with patio restaurants and small shops is in walking distance as…\n",

The staff is so kind and helpful. The rooms are very clean, and have the necessities you need. The roof top bar is amazing with the view of the Acropolis. There is a grocery store across the street with anything you may need along with a number of local businesses and vendors. It’s a busy city and you will see a number of homeless folks, but no one really bothers you. The left over euro coin is a nice gesture to those in need.   If you contact the hotel, they recommend a car service we used and it was perfect. It’s a worry free service and very polite drivers. Well worth the price.  …\n",

It was an amazing retreat from the packed and confusing streets of Athens and definitely one of my favourite parts of the city that was exclusive to me!  However I deduct one star for intrusive sounds at night, the A/C made quite an odd sound, like ticking every so often, what I suspect to be the plumbing and banging around from above (we was top floor so that could be something to do with it).\n",

Even before arriving, when the hotel office noticed I'd booked 2 different room types for my stay (one room type for the first 2 nights, a different room type for the last 2 nights) they alerted me in advance, which saved us from having to change rooms mid-stay.  Upon arrival they welcomed us at the reception desk with a special Greek liqueur. Nice! Not only that, when I told them my husband is a very light sleeper they have us a spot well away from any noise or traffic. Breakfast was great - we always chose the sweet fresh fruit, yogurt and honey.

The wine is fantastic at a great price.  Every night, Aris greeted us with a big smile and served us like we are his best friends visiting his home.  One night, he even prepared us a fruit salad.  We will definitely come back again to have another glass of wine and chat with Aris.  Thank you for everything.  We love your hotel.\n",

Rooms are modestly furnished but clean and comfortable beds. Bathroom newly renovated and clean. Breakfast buffet was delicious with good array of food. Best of all is the rooftop bar serving great value cocktails and drinks with the wonderful Acropolis as backdrop. Overall excellent value for money. Would definitely stay there again! Thank you for an excellent start to our holiday.\n",

We liked that the hotel is situated on a retail street, lots of local traffic and everyday stores mixed with interesting specialty shops. An abundance of your basic Greek sidewalk cafes nearby. Our double room was clean, the AC worked well, bathroom very nice and plenty hot water. No coffee maker in room, but breakfast begins at 7am, which was very good. We had a view of the Acropolis from our terrace. The rooftop is open all day with an even better view, and the bar opens at 4pm, a great place for a glass of wine.\n",

At the ad to Loews Hotel, a rooftop dining area allows you to look across at the Acropolis a few hundred meters away. More importantly the amazing staff seem to have super powers, in terms of helping navigate even the most daunting of challenges. Our small film crew faced among other things, the need for knowledgeable tour guides on the spur of the moment, and a way to carry our gear and us during a major taxi strike. The staff solved every problem for us, and all with grace and kindness. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and very convenient.

Their staff was also very helpful and friendly in setting up transfers for us. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend.\n",

Prior to our trip I researched hotels extensively, and although this hotel was below our price range, it was consistently recommended, so we figured \"why not?!\".   For both stays we took the Metro (line 3, blue line) from the airport to the Monastiraki stop. This could not have been easier, and my husband and I chucked at the thought of having even considered a cab to get to the hotel from the airport. Attalos Hotel is incredibly easy to find once you exit the Metro station, and it was a very, very short walk.   I cannot speak highly enough about the location of this hotel.

The rooms were cleaned everyday and the staff were very friendly. Sikas at the front desk was helpful and was very informative when deciding our next greek island trip. When booking spend that little bit extra and get a balcony room. We had room 406 which had a clear view of the Acropolis. The rooftop bar is fantastic, again with an unspoilt view of the Acropolis along with the amazing cocktails available. For a 3 star hotel you'd be doing well to find better.

You hear people walking noisily up and down the stairs to go to the bar, chairs scraping, and loud music until I don’t know when. What I totally couldn’t understand was the scraping sound.

      "Review is :The Attalos Hotel is strategically one of the best one you caould get, it's on Athinas str., above the metro station of Monastiraki and you won't need the car to go to every touristic site during your trip in Athens. It is close to the City Market hall too, it is worth of a walk, taste halva! At the evening the area doesn't look that nice but it never happened anything to me, so I bet it's just a feeling... I express a very low score for this place because of its policies: I made a reservation by Booking and I won the worste room I have ever stayed, better to sleep in the street, it smelled like a sewer. When I complained to the doorman he tried to be dim, at the third attempt to dialogue with him i had to scream in front of other guests to get his attention, and eventually…\n",

It is well placed for the metro to the airport, Plaka, the acropolis, Ermou, the shopping street, and the restaurants and ouzeries of Thisseio. It has great views from its roof terrace and bar. It has two small lifts. The staff are lovely, really welcoming and helpful. The room was clean and well maintained.  We had a three person room with a balcony, but only two chairs. It was a bit cramped, with a lot of sideways walking. We had storage problems because the wardrobe door stopped the drawers from opening. It matters if you are staying for a week or more. There was only room to stack one suitcase so two were on the floor. (Bear in mind that a twin room might not have any of these issues.)  The bathroom was…\n",

Be aware though they are tiny. The beds are comfortable. The most definite plus is the Rooftop Bar with views to the Acropolis. Inside and outside seating. Drinks are very reasonably priced. You can take drinks to your room. Balcony rooms are extra. We were very lucky this trip. As returning customers, we were lucky to be upgraded to a King size bedroom with a balcony.

The hotel itself is clean and tidy with friendly reception staff. Breakfast is at 1am extra charge of 9 euros but I decided to eat out as there are lots of cafes close by.

My room was tidy and clean with luxurious soft white towels and free slippers 😉 The shower is a bit on he small side but there's plenty of hit water.  I only stayed 1 night and it was more than fine.

Rooms are spotlessly clean, but a bit faded - comfortable mattress & bed though. Quite the opposite with the bathroom: very new and high standard. Balcony with Acropolis-view - and yes: Athinas Street is VERY noisy, sleeping with open windows is only for the hard of hearing. But when the window was closed it's ok! And the upside: The hotel's position is more than ideal - walking distance to almost anything of interest. Many great tavernas in Psyrri-area just round the corner to enjoy dinner, the hotel's roof terrace is a must - we even spend some time on the sunbeds in a quiet corner of the roof garden (in November...). Breakfast (9 Euros,…\n",

We recently spent 3 nights here with family to celebrate my birthday.We were made to feel so welcome by all the staff and the free drinks on stunning roof top terrace was a special treat on my birthday, so thank you. We had rooms next to each other with balconies as requested. The bathrooms had been beautifully refurbished since my last visit and the beds were very comfortable. There is some street noise if staying in the rooms on the front, but that is to be expected in the middle of Athens and is more than compensated for by the location and the view. Ask for quiet rooms if this is a problem for you. Thank you everyone at the Attalos for all your…\n",

The breakfast was actually pretty good, with a good selection to choose from and pretty reasonably priced. In comparison to coffee shops etc., good value we thought. You could stock up on enough food and drink to last most of the day, as it can be pretty costly to eat out all the time.

Like many older hotels, the lifts are small and would certainly not be permitted in the US, as there are no doors inside the lifts but rather the bare ‘moving walls’ are exposed.

The bathroom was on the smallish side, but possessing good pressure in the shower and a way to use it so water didn't flood the room. Towels were fluffy and heavy.  The location of the hotel was perfect--not in a very touristy area but with all a tourist wants to see in a quick walk. (or not so quick if you took a wrong curve on the winding streets.)

      "Review is :Attalos Hotel is a few minutes walk from Monostiraki metro station, and the Plaka shopping district.  It's a great base for sight seeing.  The rooms are small, as with most city centre hotels, but it is very clean.  The breakfast is adequate.  The staff are unobtrusive, but helpful and friendly.  They were very good helping us sort out a muddle we got into with taxi's.  The main attraction for the hotel is the rooftop bar.  It is fabulous.  The view of the Acropolis took my breath away.  The bar serves delicious cocktails, and plenty of comfortable seating.  I hope to return to Athens and I would definitely stay here again.\n",

My husband said the shower had good water pressure. The hotel is very conveniently located and an easy trip from the airport on the metro. Exit at Monastiraki station, turn left and it's just up the street on your left. There are many things to see and do within walking distance. The breakfast was good with nice variety.

The blue line from the airport to Agia Marina gets you to Monastiraki square station. The X95 bus takes you to Syntagma square which is a short walk to the hotel. Don't judge the hotel by the street it's on.

It turned out to be two connected rooms with a bathroom, which was ideal for us.  Air conditioners in both rooms worked well.  The hotel is ideally located, just a few blocks north of Monastiraki Square.  Even though we didn't arrive until about 5:00pm we were still able to have a magical walk to the square, through the Plaka, and up the slope of the Acropolis as the sun set.

It had a balcony so you could see the Parthenon and parts of the city. The room was a good size. It had a safe for your valuables. We paid a little extra and had breakfast included. There was a lovely breakfast room with a buffet. It had a variety of food from your basics such as cereal, toast and fruit to a Greek breakfast of yogurt, liquid honey, baklava, meats, cheeses, olives and more.

Our room was clean and the breakfast plentiful. Staff was always helpful and willing to answer our questions. The rooftop bar has to have some of the best views in Athens. Ask for a room on the fourth floor or above; these have been recently updated.

Even though the area was depressed with almost every building front covered in graffiti, and many homeless or those seeking money for trinkets, the view of the acropolis from the hotel, the convenient location and the friendly and hospitable staff made the stay worth while. While I was concerned about pick pockets, I never felt unsafe. Our room was basic but clean and had great AC which was needed after a long day in the heat.  Sitting out on the balcony at night looking at the lit up acropolis was magical.  There are plenty of shops and eateries around the area so we did not…\n",

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and simply, but well-apportioned. The bathrooms have been updated over the past several years, and are now some of the best I encounter while traveling in Greece. The breakfasts are fulfilling and tasty. The staff are exceptional, going out of their way to make sure that your visit is a pleasant one. And the rooftop garden and bar...that view of the Acropolis cannot be beat!   The hotel is located a hop, skip, and a jump from a number of significant historic sites (Library of Hadrian, Ancient Agora, Kerameikos, etc.), shopping and dining districts (Psiri, Plaka, Monastiraki, etc.), and metro transportation.

And it's a gem. The hotel has a charming interior, on every level there is an area to sit, and the first floor offers free use of computers and coffee, a useful facility. I must also note, I found the lift to be a retro delight! The hotel is situated in a prime location, with access to the main sites of the city, a stones throw away from the metro, and in a safe location.  However, the rooftop bar is rightly the triumphing force in this hotel. Great prices for drinks and amazing views of the Acropolis and wider Athens.

The area seemed to be perfectly safe later at night and was definitely safe during the day.  The location is overall good.  About a block away to one side is the Psiri area, which is apparently an up and coming area.  Some of the bars on the outskirts in the short distance between the hotel and Psiri may be a little youngish and perhaps \"edgy,\" later at night, but get past them and there is a very well developed and busy dining area with loads of restaurants for tourists and locals.

The location is incredibly convenient to the metro, including the metro to and from the airport, and a short walk to really great areas of town.  The hotel is on a fairly busy commercial street with lots of small discount-type shops, so not located on the most picturesque street itself (though perfectly safe area I think) but once inside the hotel that doesn't matter, especially given the view of the Parthenon from the rooftop bar.  The front desk staff are wonderfully helpful and friendly.  Great breakfast.  We stayed there at the beginning and then again at the end of our trip to Greece.

The room was a single room. Nothing special, but clean and good pressure in the shower. Wifi were medium quality. Breakfast was ok.

It is comfortable enough, and has a great roof terrace bar with lovely sunset views of the Acropolis and Parthenon.  Breakfast is OK - full range of the usual help-yourself fare, and most of the staff are friendly and helpful. So why only an 'Average' rating - I am sorry to say that it is rather tatty and needs a really good makeover to get it up to 2017 standards.  Bathroom fittings are cracked, plugs don't fit, carpets are sticky, and luggage storage space is 'help-yourself' down some quite rickety stairs into a very grubby cellar.

      "Review is :The perfect location so close to the metro & walking distance to almost everything else you'd want to see.  I was in room 206 (2nd floor) with a front facing balcony which was nice. The room itself was basic & not massive, which is not an issue unless you are planning to stay in the room a lot!  The main issue I had was the very small shower cubicle & stupidly placed shower with a shower curtain that is pointless as the fixed shower head is pointing directly onto the curtain meaning it's almost impossible not to soak the floor.  I think all rooms had a similar shower cubicle/shower curtain that I saw due to open doors while the cleaner was in there.  There was no power sockets near the bed, but reception gave me an extension, which was good and solved that issue.  The wifi was…\n",

Monistiraki rail station is only yards away and the main tourist areas of the Plaka and the Acropolis are easily walkable. In the streets right behind the hotel there is a vibrant area with bars and good and cheap restaurants. This area almost has a feel of a village within the city. We had a couple of good meals there during our stay.   Now the less good points. When we stayed in this hotel we were given a really small room with a view of a dirty internal roof area and walls. The room was very hot but the air conditioning was so noisy that it was not possible to sleep with it on. The hotel itself was noisy…\n",

The buffet breakfast is unbelievable with so many choices that decision-making is a bit of a problem. But despite the cosmopolitan makeup of the hotel guests, everyone seemed more than happy.

While it would be nice to have privacy for us as a couple, we knew we were staying in an economy hotel and had no expectations beyond the three single beds in the rooms. The hotel was extremely clean, and even though Athinas Street is not one I'd want to be on alone late at night, we felt perfectly safe within the hotel. Although our balcony room looked out over the busy, noisy street, we only had a little of the street noise and only when a loud crowd of young…\n",

The rooms were all fine and the beds clean and comfortable.  The reception was warm and friendly.  The jewel in the crown is the bar at the top of the hotel with excellent views across the city and particularly of the acropolis.  Generally, we spent time up there but a couple of evenings were ruined by a stroppy rude barman who had a sense of superiority about him which he didn't warrant.

We really enjoyed our stay here, all the staff were really helpful especially the barmaid on the roof bar, which is must go to after a day around the city. Great views of the Acropolis whilst enjoying a drink. The only thing I will say is, our walls were pretty thin so we could hear our neighbours generally talking but this didn't bother us to much because we had been out site seeing all day, we were so tired and just conked out, but that's the only thing I'd quibble about. Had good wifi as well. Really good spot for the metro as well, you can get to most places including a direct train to the airport. Would definitely recommend…\n",

From the hotel, I walked up to the Acropolis. I am not very fit, but it was an easy journey. The hotel is also a short walk away from the National Archaeological Museum. Plus, you are about a 10 minute walk to the parliament, and less than that to the main shopping street. The location was awesome. I didn't need to take a bus or taxi, as everything important was within walking distance.  The hotel room itself was nothing too special.

From the metro station just (200m) 5 minutes walking to the hotel. They have 24 hours reception, Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are not big but clean and enough for sleeping nights. They also arrange guided tours for their guests through different touring companies. you can walk to the Syntagma square within 10-15 minutes easily. they have free WiFi but signals are not very strong to the rooms. If you go to the roof top bar lounge in night time, you can see an amazing view of illuminated Acropolis.\n",

The staffs remembered us (and our luggages) upon our return from Santorini,  the front desk staffs and the bartender (the man) are helpful and always with a smile that made me feel the warm welcome.  Location is perfect, just 2-3 mins to subway station.

Ideal if you are in transit for a night or just have a couple of nights to stay. You cannot be bored. The Acropolis and historic sights are within walking distance and in the evening many bars and cheap restaurants serve excellent and inexpensive food.  The famous \"flea market\" is very close by which is fun and can absorb you for hours.  The rood garden at the hotel is excellent with good night views of the lit up Acropolis (see my photo).

If you're going there from the airport BEWARE CORRUPT TAXIS, as ours took us to the wrong hotel and overcharged us considerably. As the Attalos website advises, if you disagree with the taxi-driver, go into the hotel and let THEM sort it out with the driver!  I was very impressed with the clean, nicely designed rooms. The balconies and views of the Acropolis from my street-facing room was excellent, and I enjoyed sitting on the spacious balcony relaxing.  The private (en suite) bathrooms were well appointed, spacious and clean. The small elevators functioned well, and the rooftop bar is not to be missed!

Monastiraki metro station is a couple of minutes walk away.  The hotel reception staff are friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and had our visit been in the summer we would have made use of the balcony. The crowning glory is the roof top terrace bar with its fabulous views of the Acropolis and Lycabettus Hill. Even the torrential downpour didn't spoil our G&T's. Unfortunately our early morning flight meant we couldn't have breakfast so unable to comment. We often stay in Athens and would have no hesitation in staying in the Attalos.\n",

Ideal location, lovely staff, nice rooftop, terrace bar, rooms spotless and nice breakfast room with good choice of food.

On arrival we were allocated a twin room with terrace and a double room with balcony for the duration of our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel as a comfortable base, near to Monastaraki metro/square, close to Syntagma Square and walking distance to Acropolis (uphill).\n",

With, on top of it, the friendliest staff, Angela's straightforwardness and Panayiotis' (Panos, as he prefers) smile - which helped me forget a few drunk and giggling English girls...

Having done my research, I was very specific about what I wanted: balcony room, view of Acropolis, high floor but not too high so as not to be right below the roof deck, and one of the newer mattresses (because they're apparently in the process of changing them, and some of the older ones aren't as comfortable).  We stayed here twice... and they pretty much accommodated all my specific requests, with the exception of the mattress the first time.

The street it faces has improved in character over the past few years, and there are now plenty of bakeries, cafes, and so on within a few blocks.

The room was very clean and serviced daily. There is a breakfast room on the lst floor which is continental buffet-style  and perfectly O.K. There is also free wifi. There are lifts to the upper floors from reception. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is just a short walk away to the train at Monastiraki Station and once you cross over Ermou St, there is Monastiraki Square with lots of little streets running off it with plenty of choice for restaurants and shops. We bought tickets for the Hop On, Hop Off bus from reception one day and the stop is only a few minutes walk away too.…\n",

The Acropolis and Acropolis Museum, Syntagma Square, and other must-see sites are within easy walking distance (or a short, inexpensive cab ride), which we greatly appreciated.

      "Review is :The hotel was a few minutes from the Monastiraki station, directly accessible from the airport. It was easy walking distance from a wide range of restaurants, including in the Plaka. I found it convenient to walk every day along the walking street Ermou, to take the tram at Syndagma Square to where I was going. A cheap (9 Euro) 5 day pass on public transport, including Metro, made it easy to get around. The room was comfortable and good value, though the shower curtain made it difficult to avoid a large pool on the bathroom floor. The air conditioning coped reasonably well with the hot summer weather, even though it had to be switched on on every re-entry. My only complaint was that an otherwise excellent breakfast was spoiled by awful (presumably instant) coffee, but if you're…\n",

A/C and hot water were available without a problem, housekeeping came daily, the breakfast room had a nice variety and no one complained.  The elevators were prompt.  Early arrival luggage storage is available.  The reception lady (sorry I forgot your name) on the front desk was very pleasant and I got to greet her with my limited Greek daily and candidly, I think she enjoyed it also.

It’s very clean and has a good range of food for breakfast.  The furnishings are not up-to-the-minute, but everything works... and it had an air conditioner!  Bliss! Our room had a wonderful view of both Lycabettus Hill and, if we peeped around the balcony partition, of the Parthenon.  The rooftop garden also had wonderful views of the Parthenon and surrounding areas, which were particularly impressive at night.  Priceless!

The bathrooms tend follow the same pattern, larger than others in Greece and comparable to American standards.  (We have not stayed in other hotels in Athens so have no basis for local comparison.)

However, if that's not your main priority, the hotel is perfectly situated far south of Omonia, right in the middle of Psiri where many new bars and restaurants have cropped up, and also very close to the sites you need to see during your stay.  There are wonderful cafes on the same block where we had some of the best breakfast you can find in the city.  I'd recommend this hotel to anyone that's looking for a budget-friendly spot in a perfect location.\n",

The room was well-furnished and looked modern and clean. However, the room had very strong smell of smoke and that literally pissed us off. Being a non-smoker whole my life, I am very sensitive to the smell of even second-hand smoking. I would say that they should fix this issue somehow or at least provide a room spray in the rooms so that guests can use if they feel so.   All other experiences were positive. The lady in the brekfast room didn't seem like very friendly, but I guess that's just because of her uncomfortableness to speak English. Breakfast was basic, but filling anyway. The rooftop bar was nice, and the lady there was pretty friendly.  …\n",

And the location really is outstanding. Monastiraki Square, shops, wonderful restaurants and patisseries and easy access to the Metro.  The rooftop bar has a fantastic view of the Acropolis as do many of the room balconies.    My friend described the rooms at \"monk cells\".  They are very basic.  No coffee or tea maker, hair dryer that looked like a vacuum hose and very compact rooms.  There is wifi provided that was okay -- a little unreliable.  Breakfast is what you'd expect of a budget hotel - do take advantage of the wonderful patisserie that is next door.  Americans: if you just must have an \"American-size\" coffee,…\n",

Rooftop bar has a magnificent view of the Parthenon.  5 Minutes to the Monistiraki Metro station.  Walk to the Plaka, Parthenon, Archaelogical Museum, University of Athens, Syntagma Square. Breakfast is better spent at a bakery around the corner.  Coffee is much better. Try not to get a room on the 6th floor unless you are a late-nighter.  They move the chairs on the rooftop bar and it can be rather annoying.  They accommodated a move for us to a lower floor.  Wonderful staff.\n",

It is just a few meters from a main stop on the subway (train) and is in very close walking distance to one of the main centers in Athens -- the Monasteraki Square, where people shop the flea market by day and come to life at night. The hotel is also close to Plaka, another good walking area with cool little shops. Locals refer to Plaka as the Bohemian district, although it doesn't feel Boho to me. Quaint. Cute. Charming. Yes. Boho? Not so much. Anyway, the hotel's location on Athinas Street is safe, although it gives the opposite impression because of the unsightly graffiti and homeless men sleeping on the sidewalks. There is a strong odor of stale urine on the streets near the hotel, but that odor permeates…\n",

It is very close to an underground station on the direct line from the Airport. When we left the station and turned into Athinas Street we were shocked by the run-down, badly-lit condition of the street. Next morning it appeared somewhat better with its mainly hardware shops displaying their colourful wares on the footpath. We soon realised that many streets in Athens now look very shabby and run-down because so many shops have closed due to the economic crisis, and there is bad graffiti on most of the closed premises. It also appears that the streets and footpaths are not being washed. We found the staff at the Attalos friendly and very helpful. We had booked our room…\n",

I would describe it as a typical European budget hotel. Don't expect a lot of American amenities. However it has a very good breakfast, and a great rooftop bar and restaurant where you can sip a drink while watching the sun go down over the nearby Acropolis. It's two blocks from the subway line to and from the airport and Pyraeus port. Although it looks like it is in a somewhat industrial area of the city, and the city streets are noisy, if you chose one of the less expensive interior rooms, it is quiet enough. It really is only a few blocks from many of the tourist sites of Athens. I recommend reconfirming your reservation…\n",

You can even get take away from the Falafel House next door and bring it up to the rooftop bar and buy a 10€ bottle of wine.  Heaven!    Location-less than a 5 min walk to Monastiraki.

The good 1. excellent location (metro, food shops, attractions) 2. very clean (cleaner than some 5 star hotels I have stayed at) 3. really fast wifi 4. quick check in and check out.   The bad 1. If you easily wake up for noises you may not get good sleep here. Noises from the corridor are very clearly audible inside the rooms. I woke up a few times when people were talking outside. luckily did not happen often.  I did not try the breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of shops close by to get something to eat. (there is really good a falafel shop and a bakery few meters next to the hotel)  I would easily recommend this hotel for any budget traveler…\n",

Breakfast is included but there are better places nearby. Friendly staff and clean facilities. The roof top bar is wonderful to relax and take in the view of the city. We definitely recommend it. It's not the fanciest but is perfect for sleeping and relaxing when not out and about.\n",

What do you expect from a hotel in the middle of Athens??) to the included breakfast IF you wanted it, we had the best time.  The room was perfect and we even had a somewhat view of the Acropolis from our room.  Please go to the upstairs bar for the amazing views.  It's never too busy and the bartenders are awesome.  Don't expect a bell hop or taxi service, as you can miss this place if you walk right by.  They had the crib I was asking for before we arrived, which is way more than I can say for many of the major hotel chains I've stayed at before.\n",

The location was perfect - all the major historical sites are in walking distance and the main museums are easily accessible from the Metro that is a couple of blocks away. The room was comfortable and the size I expected for a European hotel. Operating in the small shower was a bit of a comedy routine, but we made it work. My tip - do not turn the water pressure all the up, it makes it easier :). Although the hotel fronts the very busy Athinas Street, we never heard any noise from our room on the back of the hotel even with the windows open. Do not miss the rooftop bar for the view of the Acropolis! I would stay here again when we return. It was a great trip.\n",

Close to not only the Metro (Monastiraki Square) but also to almost everything that I was here to see. It was so easy to get here from the airport and once here I could walk everywhere. I spent many hours walking the streets of downtown Athens and walking all around  the Acropolis and surrounding hills. The PRICE we paid was also very affordable. The STAFF were also very friendly and helpful. Thus it will get that extra star.  My main complaint would be the shower in our room. Too small. Tiny shower curtain that does a better job of sticking to your body than keeping in the water. But really it's not that big of a deal. I would stay here again.\n",

The bed was comfy, there was  enough storage and the aircon worked just fine. The bathroom was small but functional and like our room, lovely and clean.

Last time we visited the hotel we were not so pleased about the staff in the roof-top bar, - it has changed to the better now, - so we enjoyed having a drink and a chat there. The hotel is easy to get to from the airport (Line M3 to Monastiraki), a short walking distance (3 min.) to the hotel. Lots of restaurants, snackbars etc. in the area.

      "Review is :The rooms are small but that is all the bad we have to say.  The rooms work just fine though and it is an older building with heritage.  If location is a priority, this place has it in loads.  This was not our first time here as we have traveled to Greece before and the main reason we came back to this hotel is that along with the incredible convenience to all the sights, the roof top bar (where you can just go to observe) has a spectacular view (especially at night) of the Acropolis.  Not sure i need to say more.  We stayed here twice on this three week trip as we went through Athens a few times.  If the inside of a hotel room is incredibly important such that you want yards of space, a big tv, with lavish carpeting, this is not your place.  As others say, the street can be…\n",

      "Review is :I was very disappointed in this hotel, given its high ratings on Tripadvisor. The first red flag is the hotel is located right in the middle of an extremely noisy, crowded, run-down part of the city. The view outside the room was of a brick wall, and I did not get any sleep during our stay due primarily to the fact that there is constant partying from clubs and street noise in general that kept me awake. The receptionist was very pleasant, but that's about the only good thing I have to say about this hotel. The room was an absolute shoebox. There was barely enough room for my husband and I to manuever around the beds with our suitcases (carry-ons, at that), and the bathroom has literally only enough room to stand in one spot. We might as well have been sleeping on straight bed…\n",

I had from the balcony of my room a wonderful view of the Acropolis and there was an even better view from the roof top bar. The staff were also helpful and friendly.

The room had a balcony and even a view of the Acropolis, albeit a view framed by taller buildings, but a view nonetheless.  The room was clean and comfortable. It had a fridge, air conditioning (that worked relatively quietly) and TV with a variety of channels.  Wifi was good, but there is also a small computer room where you can print out boarding passes, etc.  The bathroom was decent size, with a good size shower. The only problem was that there is a small step…\n",

Even if you want to venture further afield then it is very close to Monastiraki Metro. It's an old building on a busy (=noisy) road but the staff are very friendly and it's excellent value for money. Surprisingly the bed was one of the best I have slept in your a long while. And then there is the roof top bar...with a view of the Acropolis and Lycabettus one side and more of Athens the other it has to be one of the best views around.  Well recommended.\n",

Call us fussy but we like to sleep undisturbed. Unlike other hotels that we've stayed in with true triple-glazed noise-blocking windows, this hotel didn't have sound-blocking anything. Wed. night our 2nd flr room faced busy Athinas Street. Motorcycles, trucks all night. Thurs. night-different room on 2nd flr. Window faced quiet back alley--until 10 p.m when a busy discotheque started, the music blaring until 4 a.m. & motorcycles & voices.

I had to leave for the airport at 3:00 am and they made sure the breakfast room was open so I could grab a coffee or anything else I wanted, had a cab waiting for me and cheerfully  lugged my enormous suitcase out the door. I've stayed at the Attalos every year for the past 7 years and I would never consider staying anywhere else. Sakis, Maria, Kostas, Pannos  are like family.  The  rooms are simple yet clean and spacious. Get one with a balcony and gaze up at the Acropolis, stroll out to have dinner at any one of the incredible restaurants…\n",

They even gave us last minute directions for rushing to a shop about to close across town.   The view from the bar at the top was great. It was so nice to be welcomed to Athens with a cool beer, nice breeze and evening view of the Parthenon.   We would definitely go back to Attalos.\n",

Nice touches like slippers and toiletries.  Excellent breakfast.  Second room:  #512 : two rooms connected!  Clean and roomier.  This was on the back side of the hotel, so the Acropolis view was limited, but there.  And the front desk staff was so friendly and warm. Location is perfect for local exploring while not too far far from all the must-see spots.  Also the metro is super convenient for airport arrival and departures.  This hotel also had some nice community areas which we did not utilize but would be helpful for a longer stay. Bottom line: for family travel, good value, basic plus, and I would stay again.\n",

The only down side was, that we were told at check in that breakfast was included in our stay but when we checked out, we had to pay 8 euros pr. person pr. day. This is not ok!!! Luckily the breakfast was quite nice as well. Beside this we had a very lovely stay and would stay here again.\n",

As with most Greek breakfasts, it's mostly carbs (cereal, toast, fruit) and greek yogurt. The rooms are not the most beautiful, but are comfortable enough and the staff is very friendly.  You are also within walking distance of many restaurants and sights.\n",

Monastiraki is crammed with restaurants serving traditional Greek food, and the extensive flea market is 3 minutes from the hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious. Wifi is good. Some rooms have a large balcony, with the million-dollar view over the Acropolis. The breakfast is an extensive traditional Greek feast. Reception staff were always friendly.\n",

The hotel is not the smartest hotel in town, it is not the most luxurious but it has than indefinable 'something' that separates it from all the others in Athens.

The bonus is the brilliant bar area up o the roof where you can sit at night, have a drink and soak up the view of the Acropolis and the Parthenon. Just wonderful.

There's a metro stop just 3 minutes away and tons of (great) restaurants, bars and shopping nearby.

The elevator/lift is also very small as it can only fit 2 people with 2 luggages. They hallway lights are dim at night, which gave it a creepy feel.   The only good thing about this hotel is the location. It is within walking distance to Monastiraki square, metro station, market and restaurants.   If you're looking for a place to just rest your head at night after walking around all day, then this is a good pick. However, if you're looking for a place to relax, then I suggest to book somewhere else.\n",

The neighborhood behind the hotel, Psiri, is where my husband and I spent most of our evenings because there are great bars and restaurants that are not very touristy. It is just a short walk to the Plaka and Acroplolis. The hotel staff is very kind, helpful, and accommodating. The rooms are very basic but clean. There is someone monitoring the desk at all hours so I felt very safe. You can keep your passport and extra money in the safe in the room.

While the location is ideal (just a 10 minute walk from the Plakta & foot of the Acropolis), the hotel itself felt incredibly dated, with pokey rooms, toilets with no chains and lifts with no door!! Furthermore, Athens is a hot city so you'd expect working air-con & a fridge stocked with water, but alas there was neither. The room was too hot and stuffy to even sleep in.  The staff were welcoming but I really wouldn't recommend Attalos, nor would I stay here again. And I've never been so relieved to check out of somewhere.\n",

We had a balcony with a side view of the acropolis.  The only real negative about the room was the shower head which had no wall fixing so was awkward to use.

Turns out my first choice WAS the same hotel I'd stayed in before - the Attalos. It is the best for some simple reasons: location - so close to Monastiraki and all the locations leading to Plaka and Acropolis, but also very near (same street) as the indoor and outdoor markets and gateway to the Psirri (night entertainment) area. Another reason: the roof - simply mahvellous with acropolis view, sunset vista et al and flowers and a cafe/lounge (in/out) to boot.

The staff was friendly and welcoming. The room was basic but comfortable and served the purpose. It had wood floors which I really like. You know they are clean. The only downside for me was the shower - I am not a large person, but the shower was small and the curtain often stuck to you when showering. A glass shower door would solve that. If you were a heavy set person it would definitely not be ideal.

The roof bar is fantastic for views of the Acropolis especially lit up at night.  The location is ideal for sightseeing.  They even provided breakfast boxes for our early morning departure.

      "Review is :I stayed at this hotel with my parents and it was great. The location is perfect since it's easy walking distance to the Acropolis and is located right next to a metro stop (the metro is very user friendly). The rooms are basic but clean and we were only there at night so that's all we needed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had only one problem with the air conditioning and they fixed it immediately. The roof view was beautiful at night and the breakfast was good. We stayed in two different rooms on our trip since we went out on a two-day trip. The higher rooms are quieter but the street noise in the lower room really wasn't that bad if the windows were closed (we had no trouble sleeping). The prices for the days we stayed were also very reasonable. Would stay there…\n",

From arrival to departure the staff were very helpful and we were made to feel welcome and looked after throughout the stay.  As a city, Athens lives up to its grotty reputation and you shouldn't let the street on which Attalos is located put you off - the centre of town is all full of graffiti, dirty and loud and sadly this seems to be making its way up to the ancient monuments as well.  When you step inside Attalos it really is a welcome relief from what can at times seem like a decaying city and once sipping a beer whilst viewing the sites from the bar, you can really feel above the mayhem of city life after a day & night exploring.  You are only a 5…\n",

I'm not sure how we ended up with three beds for two people, but the extra bed took up needed space. The window covering was missing on one of the windows, so light came in at night. A vent pipe in the bathroom carried conversations clearly to our room from another room, even though the conversations were at normal volume and the bathroom door was closed.  The thump-thump from a nearby disco and any noise in the hallway carried clearly into the room as well. The beds were a bit too firm, and combined with the noise made it hard to sleep. I ended up using earplugs.   The breakfast didn't look great so we didn't try it. The younger desk clerk was friendly, but the older one barely…\n",

The ants have taken over but once you brush them off of the sheets, the bed is firm.  We had a balcony room and the balconies (including the rooftop) are the best part of the hotel.  Beer is overpriced in the rooftop bar though.  We ate breakfast at 8 euro per person because they did not have our reservation correctly stated (included bfst).  They didn't make any effort to get it resolved either.  The breakfast room is very stuffy and bland so you really should skip it altogether and eat next door at the Food Hall is very good choices and reasonable prices....much better food.

We shopped up and down Ermou, Walked up the Acropolis, and down the Dionesus side and into the Acropolis Museum. A Metro ticket is 1.2 and half that for seniors. We ate a Psirri around behind. Recommend (locals) Oinopoleio restaurant. The rest are desert and coffee bars or \"cater to tourist\" notions of souflaki. From there walk over to Ermou/Adrianou and you'll find excellent gelato.

The cleanliness of this hotel is second to none - and the views from some of the rooms offer a stunning, almost surreal experience, as you gaze out over the Acropolis and the Parthenon.

I paid the 25 euro with no problems and when i tried to take it out the hotel to give to the homeless man i was told i was \"stealing\" from them.

Upon arrival we stayed for 3 days, then spent a few days away then back to this hotel for 1 night, then will return before we leave Greece.  Overall is it great.  We have stayed in a triple room with a nice little balcony & a view of the Parthenon.  The hotel is conveniently located with shopping, food & metro within a few blocks.  The staff has been very helpful with everything from directions to dining options to storing a spare bag while we jump around the islands.  There was a crying baby in the room next to me the first night & the hotel offered to move me the next morning - fabulous!  The wi-di is good in the room.

      "Review is :Located very close to Monistraki square, this hotel is ideally located to venture almost all of Athen's popular attractions. Also in line with the budget hotel template - it offers small rooms and limited service. One should expect a limited breakfast spread, efficient cleaning and almost no tertiary service. What was disappointing to us was the super small size of the bathrooms - the shower area was dangerously small. To add to that there wasn't any exhaust system in the bathroom - replaced instead by a nauseating auto refresher spray system. You are guaranteed a steam with your shower and a numbed nose. Also the hotel did not offer a family room which meant that a family of 3 was forced to sleep in 3 separate beds. I would recommend this hotel to single or young couples who…\n",

It's also in the heart of the Monastiraki which is, (in my option) the best spot in the city to stay. There's street performers, souvlaki row, the roman forum, the flea market, a crepe shop, and a pretty amazing bazuki bar all within 100 steps.

I called the hotel direct from Melbourne asked for triple room with balcony and upon arrival accommodation was better then expected.Its a moderate hotel close to metro and monastiraki with the many Restaurants . Breakfast was perfect for us not over the top with food going to waist , and the roof top is very relaxing. Rooms are  very clean and does not have that old musky o dour. Its ideal for a good nights sleep . Stayed there for 3 nights, Will stay there again when next in Athens .  Helen and Bill from Melbourne\n",

      "Review is :Stayed here late December for a few nights. We were able to get discounted rates as we booked way back in September. Although the room looks dated, it is clean. Most room balconies have a view of the Acropolis (particularly the Parthenon). Has standard hotel stuff/toiletries like slippers, shampoo, soap, shower cap. The in-room safe and refrigerator are pretty useful. Breakfast is just OK at €8. There's a bakery to the left of the hotel (coming from inside the hotel doors) as well as a gelato/coffee shop where you can get food to go. Just a 10 to 15 second walk (turn right once you've walked out the hotel's doors) from the hotel is a small street kiosk selling bags, gloves and other items (perhaps depends on the season), but always has food (chips, mini croissant, chocolates,…\n",

Our room was big enough, comfortable and quiet, even though we were immediately under the roof lounge. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The Attalos is a five minute walk to Monastiraki Square and Metro station, with some good restaurants in the Square. The main attractions of Athens are not far away, and often within walking distance. The rates are modest and we will stay there again if ever we return to Athens. Our daughter and son-in-law to be have booked the Attalos for the time of their stay in Athens as part of their honeymoon in May next year.\n",

For a two-day visit, the Hotel Attalos fit the bill, but for a longer stay we would have chosen something a bit more upscale.  The pros:  The hotel was a 5-minute walk from the Monastiraki Metro and very close to the main sights and lots of good restaurants. The staff was very welcoming and happy to answer questions.  Check-in was quick and efficient, and they had a dispenser marked \"this is not water\" that turned out to be very sweet, herbal tsipouro.  The rooms were very clean, and the view of the Acropolis from the roof bar is excellent. The breakfast buffet wasn't exciting, but it was filling:  in addition to the usual yogurt, cereal, toast, and cold cuts,…\n",

Fabulously located just  a hundred yards from Monastraki metro whilst theThe Plaka and Syntagma Square are just a short walk away.  The rooms are basic but clean and comfortable and anyway if you are going to spend any waking time in the hotel it will be in its amazing roof bar with stunning views of The Acropolis and Parthenon supping wine at €2 a glass. The perfect place to chill out before dinner after a days sightseeing.  We were there in November and a double room with breakfast Weds-Sun worked out at about €32 a night (rack rate is €85 which you may pay nearer to if you go in high season). Unbelievable value.\n",

We arrived by train and were very pleased that the hotel was only a short stroll away and as other reviewers have mentioned, the elevator was most welcome. Our room was clean and spacoius with a nice view of the Acropolis.  This is not a 5 star hotel but it is clean with friendly staff, I think it is great value for money. We felt safe in Athens, which we feel was a highlight of our 3 month trip. My daughter loved the free aniseed lollies at the reception desk, I tried the free drink once! It is not for the faint hearted :) Enjoy this hotel for what it is and enjoy Athens for the splendour that it is.\n",

The Attalos Hotel was a much-needed respite: they had elevators (you will appreciate this fact very much after you have been hauling heavy luggage up and down old European buildings with no lifts), and the room was absolutely huge, spacious and came with a wonderful view of the Acropolis. Most of all, I can't get over how wonderful the service is. The staff were so friendly, warm and accommodating. My family was very sick and they allowed us a late check-out so we could recover for a bit. It's not just the staff who are friendly: I noticed Greek people are ALL very warm and generous, which is why I had a wonderful time in Athens.   The hotel was also very centrally located.

The hotel has a bar at the top which has a nice view of the Acropolis, especially at night - better than most of the rooftop bars in the area.

Breakfast room not that inviting but lots of cafes and restaurants very close.  A busy hotel so book early we were travelling with friends who attempted twice to book a room at diferent times and couldn't.\n",

      "Review is :The rooms may appear to be basic but they aren't. The walls are sound proofed (recommended in Athens), with a large comfortable bed and a bathroom. The service is great. They have a small breakfast room and more importantly, a bar in the open upper floor with one of the beast views of the Acropolis. Athens is a compact city but it gets smaller if you have a hotel right in the center like this one. Most of the major attractions, restaurants and metro stations are in a walking distance from this one. You are simply right in the middle of the action. The nearby metro station has direct connections to the port and the airport. There are also computers that you can use for internet and printer access free of charge. I really enjoyed this and I want to thank all the hotel staff for…\n",

Our bed spread had stains on it, there were some long black hairs on our bath mat and the the whole room could use a remodel, but hey, my expectations were never high. The hotel as a whole is a little run down and could use a bit of modernisation, but it suited our purpose for the short 2 days we were in Athens. Might be an idea to offer some meals in the bar area, such a waste to not make the most of that view!\n",

No view, but nice and quiet at night - not like you spend much time in your room anyway. Bathroom seemed recently renovated and was quite nice. Otherwise, pretty standard accommodations - nothing fancy! What you pay for here is location, and it's phenomenal. Short walk to the Acropolis and other main sites, Monastiraki square and Plaka. Cool rooftop where you can have a drink, chill out, and enjoy tahe panoramic view of the city. I'd recommend it without hesitation for anyone that's okay with a no-frills room in exchange for great location.\n",

We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Monastiraki Metro station, as we had an early morning flight out of Athens. We found the location perfect for us. We walked everywhere from here, although you could utilise the metro to travel to the Acropolis. The staff were helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants. The bar tender at the roof top bar gave us the best suggestion for a restaurant in an area close by(sorry can't give you the name).

The hotel has a wonderful rooftop bar with a great view of the Acropolis, we enjoyed several ouzos as we took in the view. The hotel is walking distance for an Acropolis visit. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, instead we chose to walk up the road a small way to a bakery and bring back coffee and pastries to eat on our balcony. Would throughly recommend this hotel.\n",

The location is excellent, close to the Acropolis and Monastiraki, and a few nice extras, like free wifi, good quality (crisp) sheets and (fluffy) towels made the stay pleasant.

The rooftop bar has a wonderful view of the Parenthon and it also sells bottles of wine for 8 euros, which was a bonus for our group.  We spent a few nights up on the patio with a few bottles watching the sunset.  The only downside was the really hard uncomfortable bed.\n",

Also had very spacious lounge with coffee/tea. All rooms with free wifi and each floor had a small lounge.breakfast was a buffet with all you expect in Greece.

Their stay was satisfying they claimed. Most of the time they were out sight-seeing but stated that the staff was helpful and nice, the rooms clean.  The place is noisy but people who pick to stay here usually spend much of the time outdoors. If you have a room facing the Acropolis, so much the better.  Choose the Avocado restaurant if you are a vegetarian and not only.\n",

The staff are friendly the reception helpful and informative. The hotel is clean and tidy, the rooms are en suite have self adjusting air con. As the hotel is city centre it is surrounded by the noise of a Mediterranean City and Athens is a lively city. As there is so much to see in Athens you will spend little time in a hotel and the Attalos is the perfect traveller's rest. Oh and there is a roof top bar which looks straight at the Acropolis now how's that for a perfect drink.\n",

All important attractions are within walking distance (<15 minutes), as well as great gyros just around the corner. The neighbourhood is safe but crowdy. Just 5 minutes walking distance there is a huge fish/meat/fruits/veggies market, worth just to be visited.

I had to stack some furniture in the closet in order to fit our bags in the room without keeping them on the beds with us. The drain in the bathroom floor was not attached and popped off whenever someone stepped on it (which was impossible to avoid), revealing dirty standing water below.   The worst part of the hotel, by far, is the manager. We were given the wrong room during check in very late at night.

Monastiraki area is very lively at night and we felt that it is very safe.  As for the rooms; they were small, but adequate and clean, and the beds were comfortable. The thing is the walls are really thin, that you can sometimes hear other people in the next by room.  The reception is also very small, and the elevators as well - you have to go up 2 at a time.

The only thing that we did not like about our room is there was no view. We could see only the big walls of another buildings which was not really pleasant.  Another important advice to everyone, please be very careful in the metro because my iphone was stolen in the metro. It was such a bad experience because I did not only lose my phone but all the memories that I captured through it. The hotel staff was helpful to show us the police station for my insurance claim. So always be extra careful in crowded metro, visiting sites and museums. Otherwise, as a city Athens is a very beautiful place to visit.\n",

The parking place they have arrangement with is located 750m away by car and 550m walking distance. It is basically a Gas station in the ground floor of a residence building with some empty parking space. Not really inspiring a lot of confidence but it worked.\n",

The manager at the front desk was very nice and helpful, but it was extremely noisy with large tour groups and walls paper thin. The breakfast was also not nice so I opted to have breakfast elsewhere. I'm afraid for the above reasons I would not recommend this hotel.\n",

We stayed for two nights and after the first morning, we both noticed we had bites distinctly different from regular bug or mosquito bites.  I've had prior experience with bedbugs, and recognized the bites right away; we also found spots of blood on the sheets, serving as further confirmation.  When we reported the issue to the management, they immediately dismissed our claims (\"It's impossible! You are clearly wrong!\").  Then, they abruptly went on the offensive (i.e., accusing us of having brought the bedbugs with us... even though we hadn't seen a single bite before sleeping in their beds).  The woman at the reception desk was extremely rude and haughty; at times, condescending. …\n",

The location is quite good, only 2 blocks away from Monasteraki Square which means it's also pretty close to the cute pedestrian streets in Plaka. Though the room was small, it had everything I needed, plus a flat screen tv and a bathtub (which I think must be pretty spectacular since it's the first one I've come across in Greece!!)! Another super perk is the rooftop bar with its view of the Parthenon. I recently reviewed another hotel in Athens here on Trip Advisor (Nefeli Hotel) and I'd say that one is in a cuter, quainter neighborhood and over all better location, but Attalos has better rooms. There you have it...\n",

The hotel is close to the attractions and on our departure the ride on the metro to the airport was easily managed. The buffet breakfast was excellent as was the service provided by the waiter over seeing breakfast. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to prospective visitors to Athens. It was a pleasure to stay at the Attalos! Make sure you make the most of the roof top bar.\n",

      "Review is :Just back from 3 nights at Attalos hotel. A bit dated especially the bathroom but perfectly adequate and clean. The bed was the best we'd slept on in 3 weeks of island hopping, and very good air con which we were so grateful for. We had a balcony with a view of the Acropolis which was great. The rooftop bar was good for a pre dinner cocktail and if you had the cocktail of the day it was only 4 euros which couldn't be beaten anywhere in Athens. Our breakfast was included in the price of the room but not sure if we would have paid 8 euros for it to be honest. There are so many restaurants in the area, you'll never go hungry but our favourites were a couple of ouzeries which are tapas bars. After nearly 3 weeks of moussaka and kebabs they made a nice change and are in a pretty area…\n",

He also provided us a detailed map of Athens and told us how to get to the attractions. All the attractions is within walking distance. Very convenient.

We walked to many Greek ruins including the Acropolis (about 20-30 mins walk) - if you enjoy seeing the city that way it's was better than taxi.  Monastiraki Metro is about 2 blocks away, which allowed us to take the metro the ferry stations in Piraeus. From Piraeus you can book a ferry to any Greek Island.  The metro was super cheap, maybe 2 euros at most to get to Piraeus so I recommend you not waste money on a taxi.  Also the hotel is maybe 3 blocks from Monastiraki Square which is lively with restaurants, bars, shops, and also has several ancient ruins that you can walk to.  We didn't stay in the hotel much but one night we did go up to the roof top bar to check out it's view of the Acropolis. …\n",

Plenty of restaurants around the area so we never worry about going hungry. We walked to the Acropolis, Syntagma Square and Ermou Shopping area. Our room with balcony had a side view of the Acropolis at night. We enjoyed our complimentary wine on the first night sitting at the balcony.

My wife and I went there for a couple of nights this past week, and we stayed at a wonderful place, the Attalos Hotel. We would recommend the Attalos Hotel for future travelers for three main reasons.   First, the hotel is in a prime location. It is located in the Monastiraki neighborhood just a couple of minutes from the metro station. We found the Monastiraki neighborhood to be lovely. There is a great flea market nearby with all sorts of souvenirs and knick-knacks. The hotel is also located in the midst of a bunch of reasonably priced restaurants.

It was clean and so I do recommend it if you plan to do what we did, spend little time in the hotel and are looking for great location and price (94 euros).  If you need more space or prefer a little more upscale hotel, I would recommend looking elsewhere.  The rooftop bar of the hotel is really cute and quaint and has a nice view of the Parthenon at night.  While we didn't really use the balcony, there was one with a so-so view.\n",

The first sight of Athens was a bit scary with damaged shop fronts and graffiti but we soon became used to it , indeed the daytime street bustle was strangely attractive. The night time reception was friendly and helpful about places to eat and responded to our request for a quiet room (see Trip Advisor reviews) by sending us to a 2nd floor smallish room with one window opening onto a light well - we were disappointed at first but soon appreciated the quiet. The major…\n",

If you are looking for the absolute basics (clean bathrooms, towels, bed) then go right ahead and as it is right in the center of all sites in Athens and monastraki station so you certainly won't need a cab to get around. While this is highly rated on booking.com (they proudly display their scores) just remember this is an extremely old hotel meaning old lifts, bathrooms, decor, tv, etc. even the rooftop bar sucks\n",

Very close to Monastiraki metro station. Not big room, but quiet. Good price. We visited two single bed room which cost 65 euro per night. Good service.

After reading few reviews I e-mailed them that I would appreciate a top floor and they actually gave us the best available room in whole hotel - 606. That is the room on the south-east corner and here you have the best view to Acropolis and you can sun-tan in the morning hours. These two factors combined are not possible from any other room.

Then we checked out, but left most of our luggage in the hotel, and took the ferry to Hydra for an overnight stay.  We returned to Attalos Hotel the next night and stayed three more nights, checking out on April 8, when we returned home.  We were in three different rooms during our stay, 506, 511, and 610.

With over 50 nights in hotels per year, I understand the notion of the value for money in every hotel I stay in. Let's say that Attalos is pushing the limits a bit, trying to play in a category it doesn't belong to. Location is great, for sure. But the small cubicle tv's are very outdated and something from the past, the breakfast is super basic and the bathrooms are smelly (mold?)

The neighborhood is going through a gentrification - quite a mix of second-hand clothing stores, banks, and upscale patisseries. Staff were very friendly and helpful throughout. My room (third floor) was clean and a bit spartan, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom facilities fine.

The breakfast is a bit pricey for what you get, but there are plenty of places around for those who prefer a smaller fare in the morning.\n",

I stayed in 207, an ok size room with a small window to the back of the hotel. The bathroom was small and the proverbial cat would not have liked to be swung in there! The walls are paper thin so you'll hear your neighbours very clearly and as the cleaning lady starts her round VERY early (before 5am), you should bring earplugs. The hotel is super central and the rooftop bar is great. As the staff is kind and helpful and the rates are good, I would come back - but bring my earplugs!\n",

The hotel is close to many attractions such as Accropolis, Monastiraki, ermou street and the Metro, which just few blocks away, is convenient point to  connect you to anywhere around the city.  The hotel rate is very reasonable and room is very clean. The noise from the street can be a bit disturbing but then again this is center of bustling city and that's part of the fun! The staff are all friendly and ready to help. Thank Kostas and Saki and the 2 ladies in the restaurant.

It's a great location if you have a day or two to kill - with easy access to all the sights.  The staff are pleasant.  The hotel itself is tired - tiny rooms - antique elevators (which are entertaining in their own way), and furnishings in dire need of replacement.  The roof terrace is the saving grace - with lovely cocktails available (no BYO!), and a wonderful view.  The Attalos does what it needs to - however I can't help but feel it could be so m uch more with a little love!\n",

Staff are just lovely and our room had a super view of the Parthenon from the balcony.  The roof terrace has an even better one and the drinks are very well priced.

No kettle but free tea and coffee in the lounge 11am - 4pm and free wifi and use of computers - useful for printing out those return boarding passes.  It was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see and just behind the hotel a little square with tiny restaurants and cafes, not as crowded as Monastiraki Square and the Plaka.

Perfect for shopping, and half-way equidistant between the primary tourist destinations of the city--the Acropolis/Agora, and the National Archaeological Museum.    The staff at the hotel are wonderfully helpful, polite, and willing to assist with just about anything!  AMAZING!!  The rooftop bar view literally can't be beat.  Even from the Plaka, rooftop views are so-so of the main night-time draw--the Acropolis/Parthenon....because from the Plaka, you're too close, and often the view is obstructed by the hill of the Acropolis itself, or by trees.  However, from one block back, at Hotel Attalos, and three floors up, the view is AMAZING!  And you can bring up your own…\n",

Local shopping and sightseeing buses just outside the door.  We asked for a corner room with balcony and views, not flash but great to sleep with a cooling unit (as it was 38 degrees).  An easy going breakfast area and FANTASTIC rooftop bar and terrace - not many better views around the world than this! For some reason this Hotel has stayed with us - I think because it was small, friendly and has a family feel with plenty of character - do not expect the bland and impersonal feel of the larger and more upmarket hotels.   We have very fond memories of this Hotel and hope to return one day.\n",

The hotel is really handy for wandering around Plaka or shopping on Ermou. Take a wander through the streets at the back of the hotel, the area is Psiri- lovely bars and coffee shops and taverns- but leave before it gets too late as it is a bit dodgy at night.

They also recommended a nearby restaurant for us to order a take-away dinner, which we ate on our room's balcony with a view of the Parthenon!  The courtesy and helpfulness of the front-desk staff was just top-notch.  Also, the roof-top bar view is unbelievable!

      "Review is :We spent two nights at this charming Hotel in downtown Athens. We had a clean and (using Athenian standards) a spacious room with a large balcony with views of the Acropolis. The Hotel also has a roof top lounge with even better views of the Acropolis and the rest of this great City! Perfectly situated between an open market and the Monastirake transit station, everything that one would probably want to see in Athens is a 20 to 30 minute walk away. We found a great restaurant less than five minutes away from the Hotel, and dozens and dozens of other fine establishments are less that 15 minutes away. I was very impressed with the outstanding front desk staff who repeatedly went out of their way to make our brief stay a nice one. While I am not sure when I will be able to return…\n",

The location near the subway was surrounded by hardware stores, shops and some bakeries.  However, it is close to the Montisaracki (sp?) subway station, so it was convenient when taking the subway from the airport.  The rooms are  small but comfortable, and the bathroom seemed dated, but the room was very clean and the TV was functional and had English news channels.  After settling in, I actually really enjoyed the Attalos.  It is only a block or so from a fantastic fruit market.  The roof top bar/patio has spectacular views of the Parthenon.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The Plaka is only a short distance away, and the prices were very reasonable, and Wi-Fi was free. …\n",

There are many wonderful cafes, restaurants and shops nearby and I never felt uncomfortable walking after dark.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and speak English well. The breakfast was fresh, with quite a few options, but the options didn't change from day-to-day.  The double room was typically on the small side, as they tend to be in the old parts of Europe and the bathroom was basic.

The Attalos is in a \"grittier\" section with more locals than tourists.  Gives a totally different perspective of Athens.  The location is wonderful.  We walked everywhere we wanted to go without problem.  The staff was friendly and helpful, aside from the Rooftop garden/bar servers who weren't very on their toes.  Nice beds.  Nice linens.  Hairdryer and toiletries.  Free wifi.  Breakfast room.  2 bars - one being on the rooftop overlooking Athens.  Small balcony.  A little internet/business center.  Elevator.  Clean rooms.  For the price, the hotel was certainly more than adequate!  Thanks Attalos!\n",

We had a room on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the Acropolis from our balcony - especially beautiful at night.  We sat in the rooftop bar one evening to enjoy the view. The breakfast was typical continental, but with plenty options available to provide a good meal to start the day.  Unfortunately, there was a party held on the roof of the building across the street with loud music blaring until 3 or 4 in the morning one night. There was no way to block out the noise & sleep was near impossible.\n",

We arrived on a Sunday so the parking was not opened. It was a bit stressful having to find a park late at night in a city new to us.

This is an efficiently run hotel in a handy location to Monastiraki Station and the Plaka. Also, the Central Market is nearby and well worth a look or to buy some fresh produce.  The rooftop bar was an added bonus as you can have a drink and gaze upon the magnificent Acropolis lit up at night. If catching the train to the airport, tickets from the station are slightly cheaper if buying two or more. Just as an added note: if you are catching a taxi from the KTEL bus Terminal A in Kiffissou Street to your hotel, be aware there will be an extra charge for luggage.\n",

We decided we did not want to go out again at night so we had a late lunch and had a drink on the rooftop with a light snack.  We watched the lights on the Acropolis light up and it was truly great.

Starting with the effortless and extremely friendly check in to the cleanliness and presentation of the rooms to the amazing location, this place is simply the best at what it does.  We have stayed at higher rated Athens hotels that were twice the price but had half the value. We have stayed at the Attalos twice this trip and will stay again next time.  Cannot recommend the Attalos highly enough. It is a gem.\n",

It only cost us 14.00 EU to take a cab from the port to the hotel. We tried to give the cab driver 25, but he refused to take it. You can walk to all the markets, the Hondos Centre which has some great boutiques, it isn't even far to walk to the bottom of Lykavittos Hill  (highest spot in Athens) and catch a cable car to the top.  We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, as there was many, many very close options available. The staff were very helpful with directions and things to see and do.  They stored our luggage for us when we had to check out, so that we could spend our last day exploring. Then we took the metro right to the airport,…\n",

The high points of staying here were the location (practically centrally located to everything we wanted to walk to), the views of the Parthenon (both from our room balconies and the rooftop bard), and most especially the friendliness of the staff.  I can not say enough about how helpful and friendly every single staff member was during our stay.  They were always able to provide assistance with reservations and recommendations, as well as answering any questions we had along the way.  For this alone I would recommend staying here.

Here is what I loved about this hotel: it is very easy to get to from the airport--just hop on the Metro,  it is in a great location, the staff is wonderful, it is very safe, the price is right, and I am saving the best for last here--the view from the rooftop of the Acropolis is so beautiful--as you sitting up there sipping your glass of wine--you have to remind yourself that you are staying at a budget hotel.

It was and exactly as we expected. It is located in a very central location and walking distance to everything you would want to see.  The breakfast was ok, European, had variety and was not anything fancy.  The only thing I might do differently next time is find a place that had a pool.

      "Review is :I first was in Athens for a 23:30 flight layover from Eritrea to Rome in 1967 and I think the airline placed me in the precursor to this current hotel. The proximity to the north side of the Acropolis, the exceptional roof-top view, memories of drinking Ouzo looking at the lit Acropolis all came alive when I checked into this hotel and went up to the roof bar for a \"wow\" deja vu Ouzo experience.  17 days later into a long, work-related + some discretionary time visit to Athens I got to know the current Attalos Hotel well. Stay 17 days, you either love it, hate it, or just find it comfortable and ideal for an extended stay.  I am in the latter category.  I have no complaints about the hotel. It performs a star above its rating, the desk staff are engaging and knowledgeable.…\n",

While the rooms are nothing special many of them have a view of the Acropolis, which is special.  The rooftop bar is the highlight of the hotel and has been renovated since we last stayed.  It is a comfortable place to enjoy a drink and take in the unobstructed view of the Acropolis.  On our last night we met a lady at the rooftop bar who had just arrived in Athens.

Our main issue was the room. We had a room on the first floor, which had renovated bathrooms but extremely dated bedrooms. The mattresses were hard and uncomfortable, and felt like sleeping on a box spring. The pillows, too, were dreadful. And the decor definitely left something to be desired. Once this hotel is renovated, I wouldn't hesitate to return. But we feel as though we overpaid for what we got.\n",

Then, when we mistakenly left behind our electrical tranformer in our room....they sent it back to our address in the US covering the cost themselves!... when the error in forgetting was truly ours!!  That's above and beyond all the excellent service !!  We loved our room with a view, having a fridge, with walking distance to cool neighborhoods...plus we were located several stores down from one of the best pastry houses in town! Beyond that, on the the very same block of the hotel, there is a very fun farmers market area open daily!\n",

      "Review is :I needed a room in central Athens for three nights in May, for work. This is not my first time at the Attalos (I have stayed here a few times since 2007). I was greeted by the friendly management staff, and even though I was a little early, my room was ready. My room was tucked into a corner of the hotel on the fifth floor, where it was relatively quiet for bustling Monastiraki. My fifth floor accomodations put me one floor down from the lovely rooftop terrace lounge, which offers spectacular views of the city, especially of the lovely Acropolis (the new retractable canopy makes it possible to enjoy the lounge in any weather).  My room was small, but since I was on my own that was fine; the bathroom had a nice deep bathtub and bathroom products were available, as was a…\n",

      "Review is :Taking allways in consideration the price rates of the reviewed hotels I would say that Attalos is an excellent choice. First the location, you are less than 5 minutes walking in MONASTIRAKI Square and the subway entrance. One of the two lines that stop in this station is the one that goes to the airport. You are very near PLAKA, the ACROPOLIS, the New ACROPOLIS MUSEUM and many other attractions from the past. You can also walk easely to SYNTAGMA or take the Metro (one stop) and in two stops you are near the -byzantine Museum and the Cycladic Museum. The staff that you find in the hotel is very friendly and will help you with whatever reasonable. Rooms and cleaning service good. The hotelhas a very nice terrace from where you have a beautiful view of the acropolis and it is open…\n",

It's location in Monastiraki is ideal and from there you can simply walk to all main tourist attractions. The bedrooms are affordable, standards of hygiene very high. All staff are friendly and will do their utmost to help you and still keep a close eye on the safety aspect. The roof top bar in the evening surrounded by bay leaves, mini olive trees and a cute little greek flag is a must with the lit up Acropolis in the background. As a supplement, I would also recommend the self service breakfast. It is varied and so copious that you will only need a light lunch later. Home from home as Attalos claims in greek; it couldn't be truer!\n",

There are also a few good gyro/souvlaki places nearby. The hotel itself is great. My favorite part about the hotel is the rooftop bar. It's great to go up and sit and look at the amazing view of the acropolis, especially at night. The wifi works great in the hotel as well as on the roof. Another plus is that their showers have great water pressure! (If you've stayed in some other places around Greece, you'll get why this is so great!) The staff is also nice and very helpful. I actually had an hour long conversation with the man at the front desk they were so nice. Attalos Hotel was great and I highly recommend it!\n",

It was also within a very doable walking distance of Ermou Street, Syntagma Square, the National Gardens and Lycabettus Hill as well.

Straight off the train from the airport at Monistiraki, which meant that despite a fairly late arrival we were out in Psirri before most of the locals! The rooftop bar had a great view of the Parthenon, but was deserted (a quiet time). We shared a lovely 1/2 bottle of wine inside before finding some local action. It would be fantastic in the summer. The room was clean and had everything we needed. We asked for a balcony with a view of the Acropolis and that is what we got, also of the sunset over Athens with a glimpse of the sea. Very friendly staff too and a bargain. I never normally write reviews but this place is worth letting people know about. We will return. Efharisto poli!\n",

I wanted one with a roof top bar and view so I had something to do at night, as I wasn't game to go out alone except to eat. I wanted one that was close to the sights, restaurants, shops, train station, day tour pickup locations, etc. I wanted a nice room that was quiet at night and that had a nice bathroom. I wanted all this without it costing me too much lol. I poured over Trip Advisor reviews and Matt Barrett's website and chose the Attalos. Thanks to TA reviews, I knew to ask for a room away from the street, staircase and roof top bar, and on the first floor because it had been renovated. The view from the roof top bar was…\n",

Being so close to the Metro is a big advantage enabling easy transit from the Airport or for exploring other areas of this fine city. Athinas, on which the Attalos is situated is well worth exploring as there is a terrific market up on the right which is fascinating for its range of foods on offer. The hotel is comfortable and the staff are welcoming! Better still, the spacious roof terrace offers fantastic views of the city and its many floodlit buildings and hills such as Lykavittos with its funicular railway climbing to the summit.

      "Review is :We stayed in the double room with balcony. The Room is very clean and comfortable. But the best part is the location near by metro Monastiraki in such a price. And, there is a very great top floor terrance, you can see the Acropolic night view, it is so breathtaking, and the experiece is worth than anything.  There is only one part should be consider if you want a very very quiet place to sleep. Attalos Hotel located on the main road of Monastiraki, so there are so many tourists and motorcyles pass the road, so you listen some noise is possible. But I think it is real not a big problem.\n",

      "Review is :Coming off of a 12-day cruise on the Queen Elizabeth on November 4th, we were informed of the transit strike in Athens. We planned to stay two nights at the Hotel Attalos and then fly home. Since the airport is some distance from town, we debated whether or not to switch to an airport hotel, but decided if we were going to be stranded, it was better to be stranded someplace where we could still tour the city. Our friends decided to stay at their pre-arranged airport hotel. The first day, Cunard arranged for us to get a private bus directly to our hotel. This day was a taxi-only strike, so we bought hop-on-hop-off tour bus passes good for two days, toured the city and went to the old archaeological museum since this was the furtherest away and least likely to be accessed when the…\n",

There's Wifi in the rooms and an internet computer with printer provided in the lounge.The location of the hotel couldn't be any better, as it is right in the heart of the city, just a few hundred metres from Monastiraki Square which is the real centre of Athens at night, and within easy walking distance of all the ruins, tourist sites and restaurants. What really set this hotel apart, though, is the service - there was a general transport strike the day we were leaving. The receptionist arranged for a friend of his to bring us to the airport in his car.\n",

Plaka, with its restaurants and shops is also close by. The major tourist attractions - the acropolis, the agora, the tower of the winds, the new acropolis museum etc are all only minutes away.  We booked a twin room without a balcony (mistake? absolutely not). The hotel rooftop has a fabulous view of the Parthenon and the rest of the city. We spent ages there. There is a bar, too, if you fancy enjoying the sunset with an ouzo. Oh, and there is a lift (elevator) and the reception staff are  very friendly and helpful. I'll certainly be going back.\n",

Breakfast was adequate, the usual fare that we’d been having all week.  There was good wi-fi signal in the public areas, but it was spotty in the rooms.  The staff were very nice as our air conditioning seemed to be warming up the room instead of cooling it down so they gave us another key card to let the room cool down while we were at dinner.

Near Monastiraki square there are several places for a dinner and it is not too far from the acropolis, too. In the hotel there is free wifi and a nice bar on the last floor with a nice panorama.  Moreover, the people are very kind. I book on their website and I got free-drink for this reason. Overall, I strongly suggest to stay in this hotel!\n",

The men at reception were wonderful - very helpful and even booked us a 3-day tour of mainland Greece at the last minute at a good price.  NB the laundry service associated with the hotel is very pricey so you might want to look around if you have time.  The rooms are average - basic but clean.  The one we had felt a bit old and scruffy to start but it became home after a while.  The bathroom is small and the shower was weird - the showerhead faced out of the shower but the base was too narrow…\n",

Rooms small but spotless, firm beds, small shower (normal for budget hotels), basic breakfast, but just wonderful people, so friendly, excellent English.  Costa, Maria, Georgia, and Dimitri's brother - thank you all so much for making our stay so special.  The roof-top bar with views of the Acropolis is special. You get the blue line metro from the airport to Monastiraki, take Athinis st exit and it's a min walk. So easy.  5 min walk to wonderful local restaurants. 15 min walk to north entrance of Acropolis - no queues. Great place to stay.\n",

Great location in the heart of the city, incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are clean and functional. I cannot comment on the food as we were staying on a room only basis. Free Wi-Fi across to the hotel too. The hotel has a smashing rooftop bar with stunning views of the Acropolis.

The room was basic but clean, could do with tea/coffee facilities in room, but it is maybe beyond star rating of the hotel.  Would happily recommend the hotel to people travelling to Athens, as we did with friends who had a poor hotel and transferred to Attalos.\n",

However, the location can't be beat:  this hotel is located extremely close to the Plaka and Acropolis.  There is a metro station just down the street.  It is also within walking distance (approximately 1 mile) of the Archeological Museum.  The staff are warm and welcoming, eager to help with anything you might need.  The rooms are rather basic but very clean and comfortable with great air conditioning (a must in steamy Athens in the summer).  There is a good breakfast room with plentiful food and a small lounger on the mezzanine floor with computers. But the best thing of all is the roof garden with the most amazing view of the Acropolis.  I went there every day several…\n",

Don't know about restaurant since we did not try it.  I saw the staff being short with some clients but they were nothing but polite, helpful and pleasant with us. The front desk attendants gave us advice, showing us direction and shooting the breeze once or twice.  The rooftop bar is a great place to finish the day with a great view of the Acropolis.\n",

The rooms are neat and clean, beds comfortable, and the rooftop bar has the best view of the Acropolis. We were impressed with the metro and ease of getting from the airport to the stop just few blocks from the hotel. But most of all,  the friendly staff will keep us coming back- hopefully before another 20 years!\n",

The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and comfortable. Ample breakfast buffet. Only drawback was that the wi-fi was sporadic (on 5th floor) or non-existent (on 6th floor).  An easy walk from the Monastiriki Metro (on the line to the airport), Syntagma Square, Plaka, Market and, of course, the Acropolis.  Our balcony offered a splendid view of the Acropolis.  Check out the neighborhood behind the Attalos for restaurants, a quiet alternative to the crazed atmosphere around Monastiriki.  We plan to return to Greece next summer and will definitely use the Attalos as our Athens base.\n",

Remember this is a 2 star hotel so for what you are getting it is a good deal. Our breakfast was included in our price. From the outside you are wondering why you chose this place but inside it is clean nicely decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast was one of the better ones we had and after staying in 7 different hotels, 5 of which were 2 star hotels, during our vacation I have a good idea of what is good and what isn’t.  Best was location you could walk to the Plaka in under 5 minutes, cleanliness of room, air-conditioned, rooftop view, friendly staff and close to public transport.

We arrived the Attalos via Metro which is so easy as the Monastiriki station is but a couple blocks from the hotel.  Metro service, airport to Attalos is 8Euro per person if I remember right.   I found Athens to be business as usual despite months and months of bad media press.  So, being based at the Attalos, I was gleeful to explore (again) and drop some Euros in the Plaka, Ermou and all the stores in between.  We 6 did are part for the economy that is for sure and my newbie visitors really enjoyed the Attalos rooftop bar in the evenings. On our one day stay in Athens, we did the Acropolis visit around 5pm and it was…\n",

The balcony was very nice and offered a view of the city and (if you strained your neck) the acropolis. The hotel is on a busy street but the soundproof doors made it a non-issue. The breakfast was basic but satisfying. The highlight of this hotel is definitely the rooftop bar.\n",

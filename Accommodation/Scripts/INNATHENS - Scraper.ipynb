If you’re a non-smoker, the entrance is through a hall w/a bar/restaurant & it tends to be filled w/cigarette smoke. Could use more ventilation there.  Short walk to the metro and most monuments are  in walking distance. Also near pedestrian-only street w/tons of restaurants & shops.  Breakfast is really well done. Lots of pastries, fried eggs/scrambled eggs - sausage, bacon, veggies, etc. Also Greek yogurt w/tons of toppings from different nuts, granola, honey, etc.  If we ever visit Athens again - will definitely stay here again.\n",

The design was well thought out and looks exactly as advertised on their website. My only complaint would be the hairdryer. You have to keep squeezing the handle to make the dryer work. Very difficult for someone with hand issues. I also don't really see the purpose as why would you leave the hairdryer running unless you were using it? Bizarre. We had breakfast once in the atrium. Don't worry if you just see the menu on the table, there is a buffet downstairs off the atrium that has other options. Overall we were happy with our stay.\n",

Location is perfect, on a quiet road just out of the popular Plaka district, and also a 5 minute walk to Syntagma metro (which is direct to/from the airport).  The star of the show I have to say is the breakfast. I think it is the best breakfast I've had at a hotel in a long long time. There are really tasty buffet options (fluffy pancakes, traditional Greek pastries, and a whole lotore), but you can also order from a menu. I had the the open pastrami sandwich and the potato souffle. Make sure you order the potato souffle well before breakfast closes at 11 at it can take a while to make, but it is well…\n",

The location is also very good being close to metro and bus stops and major sights.\n",

      "Review is :You can hardly be more centrally located than INNAthens, a lovely boutique hotel hidden through a corridor of a wine bar. You are no more than 15 minutes walk to any major site in central Athens. The rooms are spacious, though a bit funky. Arriving at Greece, we staying a room that had an open bathroom. Leaving from Greece, we got a room with a great balcony though the space was a bit smaller than the first room despite the slightly higher price. But the beds are comfortable and rooms are quiet. The breakfast is varied and served in the outside patio. We were quite happy we choose to stay here.\n",

Hot water was plentiful and the AC worked great. We had a cool view of a very old Byzantine church from our room.\n",

It is located less than 5 mins from Syntagma Square and the metro station, yet it feels like the hotel is in a secluded neighborhood away from all the commotion. It also has the best breakfast of any hotel we’ve ever visited. The staff was all incredibly helpful. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and will be back on our next trip to Athens\n",

We felt so welcome when we arrived late and tired on our first day. We were immediately brought water and treats and shown to our room (including a brief explaination). We chose the Deluxe room with City view. The room was very spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was well designed - also it was very quiet despite being a city view. We also enjoyed waking up every morning looking forward to the breakfast - so many varieties and all the food tasted great.  Finally, the hotel is well located so that most of the places we wanted to visit is in walking distance (from 5 mins to 15 mins).\n",

It was hot in Athens (upper 90s) but the room AC worked well. As other reviews stated,  the breakfast was very nice and had many options including cooked to order items.

They did everything to make our stay better such as towels, pillows ect. The provided breakfast was better than expected and many choices to keep everyone happy.

We arrived late in the morning after 24 hours of flying and layovers (and no sleep on the planes).  The staff came out to the street to greet us when the taxi pulled up and were the perfect introduction to how wonderful the Greek people are.  We were completely wiped out and thought we would have to kill some time walking around  Athens like zombies until our room was ready.  However, much to our very pleasant surprise, our room was actually ready then, check in was quick and easy, and we…\n",

Rooms are very comfortable and well provisioned, and overlook the cool courtyard where breakfast is served. Covid measures in place.  Breakfast is an epic affair with many choices all beautifully prepared. Staff are helpful and friendly, bringing us complimentary bottles of water while we waited to leave for the airport. Would totally return and highly recommend.\n",

The staff were excellent, friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was amazing with so much choice from both help yourself buffet and a la carte options too.

The breakfast is great with an a la carte menu + a buffet selection both included in our stay price (not sure if this is only whilst Covid restrictions applied). We were upgraded to a suite from a standard room & we loved it, the room (D8) was VERY spacious, clean & comfortable (bathrobes + slippers). We had views of the courtyard with a balcony & 2 chairs. We have our next stay at this hotel already booked. The breakfast & reception staff are friendly & helpful, a delight.\n",

The bed, the toiletries, and delicious breakfast every morning made for a very enjoyable visit. The location of the hotel is very central to Athens bordering both the central and Plaka Neighborhoods. Many great restaurants in the area including right next-door at By the Glass. The hotel is right across from a very quaint church with a beautiful courtyard that the restaurant is using. Be aware the church does ring it’s bells several times throughout the day. When it first happened we were a bit startled but got used to it and it became part of the experience.

Our room has been very spacious, beautifully designed, with views upon an old monastery. Very clean rooms and perfect housekeeping.  Friendly check-in & check-out.

The bathrooms were lovely and the rooms were modern and stylish. The only slight drawbacks were there were no common areas to sit in other than an outdoor courtyard where breakfast was served and the breakfast itself.  For me, the breakfast offerings could be a lot simpler.  Every dish seemed overly complicated and slightly odd when all that was needed was a traditional menu of  eggs offered in various ways and to cater to the curtain fad, smashed avocado on toast.\n",

I was worried about the possible noise from others guest sitting at the courtyard or passing thru but it was as silent as it could be. Great spacious room and very clean.   Staff was very friendly and helpful. All the time.   Fantastic breakfast!   And the location of course is great to explore the city.  We were traveling with our child and the national park (which is also right next door) filled every morning our schedule for the first couple of hours of the day.  Thank you again.

The breakfast was really good and one could get refills even if we couldn’t go to the buffet. One major plus point was the waiter/ doorman they had( I unfortunately don’t know his name). He was very nice and forthcoming.  There were no major problems during our stay in the hotel. However I find that even in a category 3 hotel there should be appropriate lighting in the bathroom for somebody that wants to do her makeup, as well as a normal power outlet.

Despite of this location really quiet at night due to the inner courtyard. There are also rooms facing the little side road facing the church - would assume these rooms are a bit more noisy. I receives complementary upgrade at check- in to a suite to the inner courtyard. Really large room very tastefully decorated. Great and comfy bed. Very clean, nice bathroom.

The bed was super comfortable. We will be back for sure. The personal touch and genuine warmth of the host made us feel very much appreciated.

Price was reasonably at 100-110 EUR/night, given the location and the breakfast.  The bed was a bit soft for me perhaps because the mattress had begun to sag.

Strategically located just off Sinopyis Square, convenient to shopping, the Acropolis, and great restaurants!  We loved the fabulous rooms, modern bathrooms, and cool vibe.  The free cooked to order breakfast and attentive staff were icing on the cake.  Don’t forget to check out the excellent wine bar at the entrance to the hotel which isn’t owned by the hotel UT further adds to the vibe!

The location is excellent for the Plaka as well as Syntagma square and the Parliament building.  Our room was very clean, the bed was comfy and bottled water was provided.  We looked out on a Russian Orthodox church and felt the room was quiet and accommodating. The gentleman at the front desk was kind and knowledgeable and the service from the staff great.  Do not hesitate to stay…\n",

      "Review is :Greek hospitality at its finest...Our first visit to Athens was marred by my sister being pickpocketed on the first day near Acropolis but this was almost made up by the pampering tht she received after returning to the hotel! The staff were sympathetic and indignant in her behalf and brought us free drinks to cheer us up. Our subsequent days were equally met with similar kindness. The staff were always cheerful and ready for a yarn when they were not busy. The location of the hotel was so convenient as it was within walking distance to most places of interest. The room was a bit small for two persons (need more hooks too!) but it overlooked the ‘secret garden ‘ which was really pretty. The breakfast was very good too! I would return to InnAthens if I was in Athens again.  Thank…\n",

I did not \"love\" our room, but it was fine and the breakfast options made up for my lack of sleep. I DO love that so many sidewalks are MARBLE!!

Very good breakfast the next morning with all the usual suspects plus made to order eggs, served in a lovely atrium. One more thing - the service was excellent, with lots of good advice for touring and restaurants.  Definitely a winner!\n",

They even arranged for a taxi to take us to the port and since it was early, they packed up a breakfast for us to take with us! This hotel felt so much more welcoming and friendly than the generic stay you would get at a chain hotel. If you want a more special memory of where you stay in Athens, pick here.

      "Review is :In(n)Athens was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff were so wonderful and helpful as well as answered any questions or concerns my family or I had. The rooms were excellent as well! They were very roomy and modern. My family and I booked a room for three and we never once felt smushed together. Also, I cannot gush enough about the food. The complementary breakfasts were better than some of the restaurant breakfasts we had and the mini croissants were to DIE for! The location was great as well. About 15 minutes to the base of the Acropolis, 10 minutes to the Temple of Zeus, and about 7 minutes to the historic Plaka Area (all walking). Honestly, there is nothing bad I could say about this hotel. It fit our needs perfectly and my family and I would highly…\n",

Problem:  1. Rooms facing the city have absolutely no soundproofing. You might as well be sleeping on the balcony because you can hear all the traffic. If you're a city lover and use to it, this won't be a problem.  2. The night we decided to stay, they restaurant across the street decided to have an open air concert from 10 PM until 1 AM ON A WEDNESDAY! You can hear every word and every note...so forget sleep.   Lovely place but the noise levels in our room were just too much for us. City people will probably have no issues with the noise levels.\n",

The building is a recently refurbished town house built around a small courtyard. This forms the central hub and a perfect, peaceful retreat from the nearby bustle of central Athens.  Our room was typically modern, attractively decorated in white & black, with accents of solid marble.  Staff were laid back, in a typical Greek fashion. Don't expect American customer service, but we were made to feel like house guests.  The included breakfast was excellent, with many unusual, Greek inspired freshly prepared options.   Our stay at InnAthens was a highlight of the trip & we would definitely book again.\n",

This hotel is rated very highly on TripAdvisor and, to be honest, I was not expecting it to be as good as the reviews. Well, it’s actually better!  Our room, a Junior Suite, was great. Plenty of space. Exceptionally good shower that worked as a shower should.  The breakfast was wonderful. It doesn’t get any better than this. Staff: friendly, helpful, happy. Finally, the location: Right in the centre of Athens, round the corner from Syntagma Square. Perfect! I can’t believe anyone would regret booking this hotel. After our cruise, we return to this hotel for a further five nights. Can’t wait!\n",

However the quality and location of this hotel are really exceptional. I will start with the only 2 negative comments I have: the room facing the street is very noisy from the cars outside and they can be heard very late in the night and very early in the morning (windows are not noise insulated -so if you struggle with that I recommend rooms facing the interior patio) and the hair drier is a bit ridiculous to use (you have to hold hard the handle to make it work, it doesn’t have an on and off button,…\n",

The courtyard is a nice place to wind down after a day's walking within the city. Can be a bit noisy in the morning with breakfast diners though as the windows are not very good in insulating the noise. Would imagine it would be worse if you're facing the road.  Breakfast is very good and you can order your breakfast from an ala-carte menu or have the ready made pastries, the latter I must say is above average. Coffee is Nespresso based so is very average. You also have the machine in the room.  If this establishment had proper coffee and better sound insulated windows, I would have rated it excellent.\n",

The only mirror was in the bathroom with a hairdryer fixed to the wall next to it.

Also included a great breakfast buffet with a possibility to order single dishes from a menu.  The location of the hotel was probably as central as it coult be Athens. Everything was close, although we did walk about 20km the first day when visiting all major sights on one day :D  We had an early return flight home and missed the breakfast, but they had packed us breakfast to go. I was amazed. Thank you!\n",

The breakfast is lovely, especially the smoked salmon bagel. As a small boutique hotel it really works. If you want a bar and hot drinks in the room then you will be disappointed. That said overall I would recommend staying\n",

The decor was contemporary and everything  beautifully designed, with a mix of natural stone and metal: clean lines and very stylish. Bed wonderfully comfortable and room was quiet so ideal for a city stop. Breakfast delicious and offered a range of fresh foods and yogurt with eggs cooked to order.

A 5 minute walk will bring you to either as also to the main shopping streets, Plaka district, most attractions and the metro station.   The hotel seems to be recently renovated in a modern, minimalist way. It's almost like an airport hotel - clean, functional, no frills. Beds are comfortable, linen is fresh and crisp and changed often. Plenty of light. There are windows that open in the atrium so there is natural light but no view. Water bottles are provided. Bathroom is fitted with latest shower systems. It's fitted with a motion sensor that start the exhaust every time you enter. Soap, shampoo etc are of good quality. Lighting is a little dim and…\n",

It is modern, clean and within walking distance of most of the historical sites. The staff were friendly and the double room we had overlooking the quiet central courtyard a decent size with a large toilet/shower behind black tinted glass. Room cleaning was excellent. The only minor issues were in fact the practicalities of the designer shower/toilet. The extractor fan was activated by a movement sensor and cut out a lot of the time so condensation and fresh air intake was a problem. This, along with a marble sink with no plug system and poor lighting meant shaving was difficult. That was a bit of a shame but wouldn't put us off booking…\n",

They are thoughtfully equipped, for example two types of pillows, one feather, one graduated foam so you can get it just right. The shower was spacious and the jet strong and hot. Nice to see that the staff enforce, very politely, the no smoking in rooms policy - hurrah!

The only little inconvinience is that if you get a room that faces the street it can be very loud.They should probably invest in better windows with a very good isolation system. Athens is a crazy loud city. But a wonderful one,one of my favourites in the world. Nearly as much or even more than Berlin or Barcelona. That is the only negative point of this hotel.(Windows) Beds are super comfortable, rooms are big enough and showers are great.The breakfast is great,something very important for me too.

We were even presented with wine, cheese and meat on arrival. Having By the Glass near was perfect after a long trip too. The staff was amazing, the breakfast was perfect and the rooms were a great size. Not to mention it was in walking distance to everything. We got a suite with a balcony and the balcony was as big as our room! The front desk was helpful and courtyard was a perfect escape and resting spot. We would definitely stay here again.\n",

The staff are extremely efficient, very friendly and helpful. The courtyard area is great for a lingering cocktail in the afternoon. The hotel is exceptionally clean and organised but very well decorated. Breakfast, which was included, was fantastic. All fresh cooked... They even made brekky packs for us on our early morning departure.  The rooms are very clean, comfortable with fantastic showers.  The hotel is 15 min walk from the Plaka and other restaurant areas and about 20 min from Olympic stadium and Acropolis area.  Just perfect place to start Grecian adventure...\n",

I mean, you're paying the price, so what's there to rave about when your expectations are met? However, I have lots to rave about InnAthens. First and foremost, it is SUCH bang for buck. I'm so amazed at how reasonably priced this place is for where it is located... In the heart of the city, walking distance to many of the major attractions.  We will begin with how it's snuggled inside and behind a bar, courtyard, and lemon tree. In spite of being in such a central location, it's still very quiet because it's off of a side street and nestled in between a few other establishments. Very friendly, professional, and helpful staff greet you in the lobby and offer…\n",

After entering through a pretty courtyard, the staff at the front desk were very helpful. We got an upgraded room which was modern, clean and comfortable with a large balcony. The bathroom was really funky and clean. Everything was in easy walking distance to the hotel and the staff provided good recommendations on restaurants and bars, and also helped us organize a private transfer to the airport as there was a taxi strike. Overall a very pleasant experience!\n",

The hotel is centrally located, only a short walk from all the major attractions and is conveniently close to Syntagma Square, where we got the X95 bus to and from the airport.   The well appointed rooms encircle a lovely peaceful courtyard, which is hermetically sealed by a large glass door from the noise and busy Plaka streets outside. We stayed in a suite, where our bed was incredibly comfortable, even the sofa bed that our daughter slept on.  Breakfast was delicious with so many really great vegetarian options on the menu (which is very unusual in Greece!).  We also love the fact that it's a non-smoking hotel.  …\n",

The staff were very helpful with any touristy questions we had; the breakfast is very nice and terrific value (it is ridiculous how much most hotels rip you off for breakfast in Australia!); it is well located to Syntagma metro station; the rooms are comfortable and stylish with good aircon; there is a taxi rank just outside; Acropolis, Plaka etc all close by; the courtyard style of the hotel meant we weren’t bothered by noise from the streets and the courtyard is a good place to relax; there is free wifi (albeit a bit slow); and lastly it represents very good value for money.

They insisted on taking us to our room and carrying our bags (no tip required or expected). This was after providing a cool drink and excellent local advice.  The rooms are comfortable and stylish. They are not luxurious but that is not what I want or like anyway. The bathrooms are also modern and stylish (assuming you don’t mind black).  The breakfast is awesome.

The balcony and inner courtyard are both quiet, lovely spots to eat, drink and read. The included breakfast is outstanding - a wide buffet plus a cooked-to-order menu of sandwiches, bagels, eggs and sweet meals. On my last day, I had to depart for an early flight before breakfast was served and they happily arranged a breakfast box for me to take away. All staff are very attentive and helpful.\n",

Really nice conversion of an old building with a central courtyard. Some rooms with balconies.  Helpful staff, good breakfast and reasonably priced - we will definitely come back next time we are in Athens. Taxi rank in the street outside the hotel. When you arrive you walk past the corridor tables of the bistro 'By the Glass' to get to the hotels courtyard and then the entrance to Reception. Oh and 'By the Glass' had lovely wine and food - worth a stop. Highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Really central and convenient location, next door to the Syntagma metro station  Friendly and helpful staff. Modern decor, the room was spacious enough and very clean, comfortable beds, soft linens, breakfast is good but can be upgraded, bathroom has good amenities but is a little dark. If you are travelling with small children, use a wheelchair or have weak knees then you should consider staying somewhere else.    It's a cute little hotel and I would gladly stay there again.\n",

Their breakfast was excellent with a variety of things to eat; unlike most U.S. hotels. They also had great sandwiches for lunch. Our room was smaller in size although some others were a little larger. They were smartly decorated with a great walk in shower. The hotel was quiet and centrally located.

I had a lovely room overlooking the courtyard and whilst not big, was a reasonable size.     The ensuite bathroom was rather small and you wouldn't really want two people in it at once, but the shower was large and the water was hot and plentiful.   A very good shower.

The room was a nice size in the middle of the city. We could walk to restaurants and shopping. We had to check out at 4am to catch our flight to Houston and they packed us all a boxed breakfast to take with us. I would stay here again and as a travel agent would recommend this hotel to all my clients.\n",

We had a family room, with a largish double bed plus a sofa bed, a nice bathroom (although only with shower), and reasonable floor and storage space. The breakfast is absolutely delicious, and it's great to be able to have it in the courtyard. Staff couldn't be more helpful and kind. If we come back to Athens I certainly would try to stay here again!\n",

Hotel: Great location People: Everyone we came across was extremely helpful and willing to go out of the way to help.  Tell them what you need and they'll be sure to help. Breakfast: Fantastic - as so many people have noted. And, they're willing to make you a sandwich to take with you if you have to leave early in the morning. Bathroom: Clean & functional. One issue: I found that the light in the bathroom was low and so found it a bit tough to shave. But, managed fine.\n",

It is quiet, has very comfortable beds, soft linens, an excellent breakfast selection and a tasty and reasonably priced snack menu. The staff is terrific: professional, helpful, fluent in English, and friendly. But there are some problems. The bathroom lighting is abysmal and could so easily be improved with better quality, full spectrum, higher power LED bulbs. The draperies collect dust and interfere with the use of the desk. Shades would be more hygienic and practical, as well as in keeping with the modern, sleek decor. The showers are also excellent, except for the fact that for two days, I had no hot water.

The reception area was a little hard to find as you have to walk through a wine bar to get to the hotel. But once you are there, the courtyard is most relaxing. Beverages such as tea and coffee are available during the day. A definite oasis in a bustling city!\n",

In the middle of the courtyard is an old tree and you can sit around it and enjoy breakfast or a relaxing coffee after visiting the Akropolis.

Front desk staff is friendly, efficient, and helpful.  Room and bed are comfortable, and room is very quiet.  The bathroom is poorly lit, but we understood from the management that this is soon to be improved. Breakfast is tasty and sufficient.  Great choice for vacationing in Athens.\n",

Close to everything. 20 min walk to Acropolis, 15 min walk to Monastiraki flea market and 3 min walk to Ermou shopping street. Lots of good restaurants and cafes close by. The hotel room is tastefully decorated and very clean. The breakfast is fantastic. Good selection of cold cuts, breads, croissants, fresh fruit and juices and the guests also can order from a breakfast menu that includes diffent kinds of eggs and sandwiches. The receptionist and the hotel staff are very polite and professional. Highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Although we live in a suburb of Athens we decided to spend one night (Parents & 2 children in adolescence/preadolescence) downtown with our main goal to enjoy the Inn Athens Hotel. It was an exceptional break! The hotel is very very beautiful in every detail. The rooms are stylish with a nespresso machine that you can use free. The yard/alley is magnificent! You cannot find another open air place in the center of Athens so beautiful. I can imagine that in summer, night and day, it will be the best place for a coffee, drink, talk, self -reflection.  Breakfast was excellent: great variety, great quality and a la carte menu. And the staff were all very polite and very helpful. To summarize, as an Athenian and familiar with the city…\n",

Excellent location at the heart of Athens, 5 minutes from Syntagma metro station, walking distance to Acropolis. The building has been renovated beautifully to a minimalistic industrial look. Rooms are clean, with all amenities, beds are excellent. Breakfast (which you can enjoy at the courtyard if you choose so) is excellent quality. Service is tending and very friendly.

The hotel was close to everything without feeling like the entire city was passing under your window. Sorry, no nighttime view of the Acropolis, but we loved the peace and quiet of a pristine little hotel set back behind a nice wine bar. There are courtyard views for a little more money, but I usually opt for less expensive and do my viewing elsewhere. My criteria are comfy beds, clean rooms, nice showers, a good breakfast, and…\n",

      "Review is :This small boutique hotel is just a few mins walk from syntagma station and it is situated inside the building blocks and the noise from the street is insulted.   We had 3 nites stay here and lived in two different rooms as booked. The first room is relatively small but adequate to open two middle sized luggages and the second is a family room and much bigger and we can still walk easily after opening 2 luggages. But it is less privacy as it is at ground floor and also find a few flies inside the room.  The beddings of both rooms are also comfy. But it looks like the first room is well maintained than second one in terms of amenities   Unlike other hotels we lived in others areas of Greece , the shower water pressure here is good and stable.

The lighting in the bathroom could also be improved, not much of it which made shaving a challenge. A magnifying mirror would be useful.  The breakfast is very good, I would recommend one of the open sandwiches.  The staff and manager are friendly and helpful. Genuinely nice people.  Great central location.\n",

It is a little quiet and cute paradise in the middle of the busy Athens.   The first night we stayed in a normal room on the 3rd floor (if I remember well). The room was very quiet. We felt we were alone in the hotel. We left very early in the morning. Despite the fact that I did mention twice to the person at the reception the night before that we would be leaving very early in the morning, they forgot to prepare a breakfast box, which was a pity because I am sure it was better than all the junk food on the boat.

We were able to easily walk to the Acropolis, Metro and all the great restaurants.  The service was very good.  Before we even walked into the reception area we were greeted and informed to leave our bags and they would bring them to us in our room.  The restaurants that were recommended from the hotel were very delicious.  If you plan on taking a very hot shower make sure you keep the windows open.  We set off the smoke detectors twice in the 2 days we were there.  The rooms are small but perfect for 2 people.  They were very clean and quiet!\n",

If you arrive at the airport, take the metro train directly from the airport to Syntagma Square. It is WAY cheaper than a taxi (8 euros per person) and as simple as could be. From Syntagma Square, it is a short 2 block walk to the hotel. The hotel is located just past the edge of Plaka, which means all the restaurants, etc., in Plaka are very near, yet the noise is not. In fact, the hotel is on a quiet side street with very little traffic, and very quiet, It is a 15 walk to the Acropolis entrance as well. There is no view from the hotel.

We were greeted warmly upon arrival despite the fact that we were several hours early they were able to have a room made up so we could check in and start exploring the city.  The staff went out of their way to be helpful and to ensure that you were comfortable.  They provided directions to a wonderful traditional Greek restaurant, arranged for a taxi for our early morning departure and even provided a…\n",

You can walk virtually anywhere you want to go as a visitor, or take a quick taxi or metro ride. The hotel is off the street, through an open air restaurant and around a lovely courtyard. It is elegantly designed and just the right size to feel homey without feeling stuffy. The staff are very helpful (Leonidis helped me with many different arrangements and questions). Breakfast is quite good and you can order additional items off a small menu. The rooms are well designed, modern and spotless. I stayed here twice and definitely preferred my room on an upper floor with a balcony to the larger room that was somewhat subterranean. I stayed in the family room…\n",

The hotel is about 2/5 minutes walk from the Syntagma subway station. I booked via booking.com, total 1 night 167€ (258,84$ CAD). We didn't get the breakfast in the morning because we had to leave early to catch a plane to the greek islands.

For how central it is - the hotel is in a very quiet spot, but still within walking distance of all the main attractions.  The breakfast was also fabulous, offering a European style 'continental' breakfast eg cold cuts of meat, cheese, breads, pastries etc. but then also offering a hot breakfast to order too.  Only downside for me would be the darkness of our room as it was only serviced by a very small window - however as tourists in Athens we spent little time in our room so this was no issue.  Overall, definitely a safe pick for Athens and would recommend.\n",

The hotel is lovely, small and intimate, lovely courtyard in the atrium to enjoy the sunshine, and have a drink or some of the delicious breakfast in the fresh air.

The hotel itself is located next to a very popular (and good!) wine bar, and the central courtyard is just behind this, although once you're inside it's not noisy at all. The rooms are comfy but basic (we had the terrace suite) - one strange aspect was an ever so slightly see-through bathroom wall/door which meant privacy was limited.

The busy road and traffic disappear after walking through an arcade and pass a huge thick glass door which leads into another world. It’s the mystique garden of In(n) Athens Hotel.  A warm welcome by Mr. Manos the manager, immediately made us feel at home. Over a cup of coffee, he gave us valuable information on restaurants and interesting places to visit. The interior of the 1930s beautiful building has minimal design of high aesthetics. The basic materials being marble, wood and iron. The rooms, apart from comfort, provide bathrobes, sleepers, high quality cosmetics, hairdryer, fridge, safe and flat TV. Clever aspects of modern…\n",

      "Review is :You can cover all your surfaces with marble and leave flowers, fruit and chocolate in every nook and cranny but what really makes a good hotel is its staff. And I can say without hesitation that everyone I came across at Innathens, from the men on the front desk to the young lady helping serve breakfast, were both incredibly warm and welcoming as well as thoroughly professional. With only a couple of dozen rooms, you rarely saw other guests and this made it feel a bit as if you were part of their extended family – the uncle from overseas dropping in for a visit perhaps – nothing was too much trouble, the focus was always on meeting you needs and making your stay as easy and enjoyable as possible.

The hotel is in a beautiful old building, set back a bit from the road (behind a nice wine bar / restaurant) and has a lovely courtyard in the middle, with olive/ lemon trees - it is just the right size to have a friendly boutique feel.  The room was great, very spacious, comfortable and stylishly decorated. The bathroom was sectioned off with a dark grey glass wall - I did read some reviews about lack of privacy, but you couldn't really see through this glass, it was fine - the shower was huge and powerful.  Breakfast is served inside or in the courtyard, there is a continental buffet selection and you can also order hot food from the menu - greek style scrambled eggs and breakfast sandwiches.... delicious.

Perfect location, walking distance to Syntagma Square, Plaka and Monesteraki as well as from the aiport bus stop, and from Syntagma train station from where you can take a direct train to glyfada.  InnAthens is located in an old building with a private entrance and an inside courtyard which gives it a charming character, and even though it is centrally located, it is calm and away from the buzzing streets.  At the entrance, there is a stylish wine bar: by the glass. Very practical to have a drink there.  A sophisticated not touristic bar where locals gather over drinks.

Breakfasts presented a large diversity of good quality food with a list of ~6 menu items in addition to the buffet. The only quibble I might have is that the standard room is fairly modest in size – not uncomfortable though – and could really accommodate two twin beds and not much more. Fortunately, the closet was decent size, so one carry-on suitcase could be stashed there and a thinner one could slide under a bed.\n",

This small (18 rooms) hotel is tucked away around a charming courtyard at 3 Souri Str. (at Filellion). Don't be confused by the first sign you see (By the Glass); this is a small restaurant whose atrium you will pass through to get to the hotel and its reception area.

It has a central open air courtyard to eat breakfast in, and to hang out, which stays cool despite the sun since the building around it is very tall so the sun only comes overhead for a short while in the day. The lovely staff met us with fresh mint tea which they leave in the lobby, and the breakfast is plentiful - cakes, frittata, eggs, fresh fruit, as much fresh orange juice and expresso as you like, etc... Loved Athens but would come again just to stay here! Newly opened in the front is a wine bar which was packed when we came, a welcome addition to the cool, calm hotel.\n",

It has a great ambience, relaxing and silent despite it be 2 blocks from Syntagma and some steps more from the main attractions. Romantic and Familiar. The rooms I stayed are impeccable, large, with comfortable beds, treats, pressures and wides showers that kept constant temperature, very clean and beautifully decorated. The staff is distinct, friendly and well prepare as can hardly be find today. The housekeeping pass unseen never disturbing the stay; besides an inviting traditional hotel breakfast the chef offers a selected menu of sophisticated sandwiches and omelets (included); the helpful reception has great gastronomical tips unknown by the tourist circuit.…\n",

I found Athens a very walk-able city and InnAthens was the perfect place for me.   The only thing I would warn about: the bathroom 'walls' were slightly see-through. If you're in the room, you'll be able to see the silhouette of anyone in the bathroom. Not a big deal, but it was a bit strange.\n",

You arrive in a quiet courtyard and enter a building that is beautifully modern but with many nods to the ancient history of the building and city, with exposed brick and stone throughout the room.  Our room felt larger than it was due to the hallway that connected the bedroom and bathroom, but in reality it is not very large.  I was surprised that the breakfast included cooked-to-order items as well as a small continental spread.    This is a small no frills property but it was a quiet, comfortable stay for us in Athens.\n",

The location was fantastic, in the heart of a city block which made it very quiet. We had a back room which gave to an inner courtyard. The rooms have very tall ceilings which make them appear larger. Bathrooms are well appointed. Breakfast includes a la carte hot plates aside from the continental buffet which included cold cuts, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, pastries, etc. The main courtyard  has tables and so breakfast can also be had outside.  The whole hotel is non-smoking. The staff were very nice and helpful and the hotel overall was very clean.

The breakfast was excellent - again the best of all places we visited. There is a choice of breakfast staples, but you can also order various items to be prepared in the kitchen (like open faced sandwiches, which were excellent). In addition, there is a Nespresso machine available 24h - great option and we used it a lot.... We liked the courtyard where we could sit down and have a lunch (picked up in town) or coffee.

Greeks have no comprehension of service. I got the distinct feeling from all Greeks that they hate foreigners/tourists and they seem to forget that their country would utterly collapse without it. InnAthens was the only shining light, so for this reason I highly recommend. Breakfast was really nice also. My only gripe was I arrived and the room I booked 3 months prior was not available. I received no communication to advise before I got there. Having said that, the manager pulled some strings and asked someone to vacate for the night and an hour and a half latter we had a room. Would be 5 stars otherwise.\n",

However the entrance is situated within a small courtyard. The courtyard is accessible only through an arcade that can get very busy with customers from the wine bar (within the arcade) that often block the huge doors leading to the hotel. There are steps leading into the reception and once inside more steps eg. there is a step to get into the elevator and more steps in the corridors. If you are travelling with small children, use a wheelchair or have weak knees then you should consider staying elsewhere. Pity, as this is actually a very pleasant, stylish and reasonably priced hotel that is great value.\n",

Our favourite was Adrianos.  There are a many hotels in Athens but a lot seem to be very noisy (from reviews) but InnAthens was so peaceful and quiet.  Breakfast was fabulous, so much choice (considering no restaurant at the hotel). Staff are so friendly, welcoming and courteous.  Had a fabulous stay.\n",

All the décor is modern and tasteful, the bathroom and shower were particularly nice. The location is excellent, sightseeing starts straight from the hotel.  The hotel is difficult to find. We showed the taxi driver the address in the Greek alphabet and he still did not know where to go. The solution was that we called the hotel on our mobile phone and let the driver talk to the hotel staff. That happened twice.  All in all, this is a very good hotel and we recommend it to any Athens traveller.\n",

I was impressed with our nightstands that were made of marble.The beds are very comfortable and perfect for couples.The bathroom was the best thing in our room. Really cool and modern. If I can find a negativity is the fact that there is no room service. * In front of the hotel there is a wine bar and it's one of the best of the city. Enjoy!\n",

This hotel is in an excellent location...easy walking to sites and shopping yet on a reasonably quiet street away from major traffic.   The decor is modern and clean and rooms are adequately equipped.   The truly outstanding feature is the warm hospitality shown by all the staff.    We were always greeted warmly and they went out of their way to ensure we felt at home and had what we needed.    The breakfasts were wonderful...we recommend the breakfast sandwiches as they were delicious!   I would definitely recommend to others and will stay there again if in Athens!\n",

      "Review is :We (couple with 12yr old daughter) stayed in room (suite) A1 which has a large double bed and a sofa bed. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would happily stay at this hotel again.  Rooms look into a courtyard that is open to the sky, which allows you to easily get some fresh air when needed sitting under the lemon tree. The room itself was a good size and comfortable. The whole hotel has a modern and pleasing design although two areas where I think they should have overruled the architect are 1) to improve the lighting by the bathroom mirror as it is hard to see what you're doing and 2) to include a small chest of drawers (plenty of space for it).  The service was excellent from all members of staff and management.  The breakfast was very good and they were quite…\n",

Situated just five minutes from the central Syntagma area, hotel is a charming haven away from the crowds and yet close enough to where the action is. It is well hidden within a courtyard and is decorated in a modern chic style. Rooms are not big but the bed is comfortable. The breakfast spread is decent. I left very early in the morning and they offered to make me a takeaway.  If I had any suggestions, it would be to make the bathroom a little brighter for women to put on makeup.   Staff could have been a little more forthcoming with help with luggage.\n",

Best location, less than 100m from Syntagma Square 2. Friendly staff, very clean rooms, very good WiFi reception in the rooms, modern design of the rooms based on iron and marble. 3. The price is reasonable in the winter season, but I think that an increase of 40% in the summer season is not reasonable. 4. The breakfast is excellent and definitely comparable to many 5stars hotels.  Concluding, this hotel is an excellent choice\n",

During our check in, the owner and the front desk manager were very helpful welcoming us to Athens and their hotel. The hotel has a unique and chic design. The rooms are spacious and are very clean. The breakfast is something to look forward to everyday. They have lovely sandwiches, nice cheese and cold meat selection, Greek pastries, freshly squeezed orange juice, tea and coffee selection.

First off, with hospitality, I think service is the most important aspect and this place has that five stars in spades. They are SO friendly here - everyone we encountered was helpful, informative, and always went above and beyond. They ooze this vibe of comfort and genuine, sincere care for you and your stay.  Although this hotel doesn't have any amenities, the design of this hotel is top notch. Such simple lines and decor and yet so modern and makes you feel like you're living in luxury. The prices aren't \"luxury\" which I very much appreciate as a bargain hunter, but that may also be because they just opened.

Sharing access with the wine bar gives a nice ambience at all hours - people around, quiet jazz-ish music, trendy  vibe.  Very different from some boutique hotels which can be very impersonal.  The hotel's courtyard is separated from the wine bar by a door so no noise comes through.  As far as we could see all rooms face onto the internal courtyard, so are quiet with no street noise.  Breakfast is provided by the wine bar - varied, good quality, though if you want really good coffee you need to ask for it.  Wine bar and hotel both have friendly, helpful staff.

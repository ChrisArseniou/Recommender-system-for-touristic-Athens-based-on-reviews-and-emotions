The roof top bar and restaurant have a breathtaking view of  The Acropolis and excellent food.   It is only  a few minutes’ walk leads to the steps of the top sights of Athens including the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum and buzzing the central neighborhoods. The Acropolis metro station is a five-minute walk away. Lots of excellent restaurants close by! Friendly, helpful staff, spacious well-equipped rooms and a hearty buffet breakfast.    We enjoyed the  main floor bar lounge with the multiple comfortable seating areas, especially after returning from a busy day of sightseeing.\n",

      "Review is :Booked the brand new family apartment through the hotel’s website directly after reading a few good reviews on Trip-advisor on its great location. The location is just PERFECT, round the corner from the Acropolis Museum, entrance to the Acropolis, tube, Plaka and countless restaurants and bars.  The apartment is adjacent to the hotel and has room for 6 people, as we are four we have felt like princesses here. It has two bedrooms with double beds and one with two single beds, one en-suite bathroom and another bathroom.   Its beautifully done, no expenses spared, it has a coffee machine, kettle, dishwasher, hob and equipment to do self  catering but the breakfast is served in the hotel so we haven’t used much apart from making hot drinks.  Welcome water and wine plus cakes were a delightful and generous surprise for us.  Housekeeping does a great job servicing our apartment every day of our four nights here.  It has a lovely balcony, the beds are super comfy and it is very quiet for sleeping as the area is quiet but double glazing adds to it!  We can use the hotel facilities of which we tried the roof top bar, which is gorgeous with beautiful views of the acropolis and the staff is courteous.  Breakfast in the hotel is the only thing we found slightly disappointing, not because the food and service isn’t good (it is) but its served in a quite small darkish room of the hotel whilst the attractive terrace restaurant at the back next to a lovely garden is empty! Where it is now, guests struggle to get past each other when busy and staff has to squeeze in between, serving areas are small and it gets quite noisy.  Hotel staff are kind and attentive, our luggage was taken care off perfectly on arrival and carried to our apartment for us. A special thank you to Maria in reservations for contacting me to sort out a problem with my credit card reservation, she was lovely and helpful.  My only remark re the apartment is that it is in the second floor snd there are no lifts so not great for people with mobility issues.  We don’t want to leave tomorrow and for sure we will return!!…\n",

However that being said I was hugely disappointed with the hotel in general - be aware that \"City views\" are of nothing, \"garden views\" are of a wall, and I wouldn't even bother with an\"Acropolis view\". The breakfast is underwhelming, the bedrooms are tired and like a motel from the 70s, no irons either in the room or at reception, and it was disappointingly noisy.   We left our room and came back to pick up a few things before heading out for the day and room service had just left our room door wide open.   Definitely a 3* hotel masquerading as a 4* - the bar and reception area is nice however.\n",

We were with our adult son so with 3 people and luggage in the room it was a very tight fit. We should have asked for a bigger room but only there a few days. Ask for rooms with the view.

My extended family (20 adults and 3 kids) stayed there at the beginning of our Greece trip (4 nights) and at the end (1 night). The service and staff are great, the rooms clean and very comfortable. The food and drinks at the roof top restaurant and bar are great with amazing views of the Parthenon. Highly recommend it.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights for a quick visit to Athens and the location of the hotel helped us make out the most of our visit. It is right next door to the Acropolis Museum and a street filled with restaurants and only 5 minutes from the south entrance of the Acropolis. Other ruins to visit and the Plaka district with many restaurants and stores are only minutes away. The hotel is very modern and so are the rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast was very nice and the restaurant in the terrace had a great view of the Acropolis. During our visit the days were very hot and we could go back to the hotel and refresh during the day as it was so conveniently located. I would stay there again and highly recommend it.\n",

They were extremely helpful to me prior to my arrival as I had them arrange airport transfers, car rentals, etc.  The view from the Acropolis  facing rooms are spectacular.  Being a boutique hotel, there are some rooms that are better then others in terms of space.  Rooms 412 and 411, 312 and 311 have great views but the bathrooms are very small. Our first time there we had the corner room which is 310 or 410 and it had the most space.  i would make the request and they will accomodate you if it is available.  The breakfast is also wonderful.  2 of our guests had gluten and dairy allergies.  There was plenty for them to eat as there is a large variety.\n",

The staff was very friendly and the rooms are clean. Although the room is small, the beds were very comfortable and water pressure was great. The rooftop bar is amazing and was a great start to our trip. Breakfast buffet had aa excellent variety. The only negatives that don't affect overall score is the elevator is small and slow and the coffee machine at breakfast makes one cup at a time so there was a wait for that. We will always stay here when bringing friends to Athens for the first time.\n",

The staff is polite and helpful, and everything is clean and tidy. No city noise during the night.  Pros: the breakfast offers a good collection of different breakfast dishes and pastries, some traditional Greek, others more continental. The kids will love it, and so will you!  Cons: the roof top restaurant has a disappointing menu, with dishes neither typically Greek nor especially savoury in any way. You'd go there to eat with a very nice view of the Acropolis and professional staff, but the attempts at being continental fall short of being anything you'd visit again. It could have improved greatly by adding more…\n",

The location is perfect in Athens for walking to all major sites, close to restaurants and shops. It is absolutely perfect if your time in Athens is limited to a few days. The room was comfortable and clean, supportive beds and modern bathroom. The breakfast was very convenient and we especially enjoyed relaxing in the roof top hot tubs with a view of the Acropolis and after dark,  drinks at the roof top bar were a perfect way to  end our busy days. On our second visit, we were upgraded to the Family Apartment in a building next door. It was a modern spacious accommodation that gave my family plenty of room to relax. The staff at the Front Desk were particularly patient and helpful…\n",

Cons: very small room; breakfast okay but their orange juice tasted quite artificial; would be better if they offered in-room tea/coffee provisions which may taste better than what’s available at breakfast.

Fantastic location, less than a 5 minute walk to the acropolis and all the surrounding sites. Room was very quiet and also had a balcony which is an added bonus that you usually have to pay for. Breakfast was ok, fry ups, pastries available also along with some Greek traditional items! There is a small supermarket 3 doors down which is also helpful!

Panioti, Maria and Philos Provide a great variety and keep the items well stocked and fresh! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Athens.\n",

There is no iron, which is strange, however, they can iron your clothes for a small charge, we had laundry done and the clothes came back like new. The room was small but we had decent outside space too and everything was spotless, beds comfortable. Breakfast was standard and again staff very friendly. Rooftop bar was closed but no issues bringing drinks up and enjoying the view, highly recommend. There is a small fridge which is handy to keep water cool, nothing bad to say about this hotel, really enjoyed our stay, thank you.\n",

Every time we left the hotel we walked along the promenade around the Acropolis, so the view of the Parthenon is a firmly fixed and wonderful memory. We walked to a lot of places - the Partenon and acropolis museum, of course, and Plaka, the Roman agora, Temple of Zeus, Parliament Square, the Park - they are all strollable from the hotel. The hotel itself - the rooms are clean, comfortable and well looked after.The lobby is cosy and pretty, has comfortable seating, loads of books, some games - everything you need to chill out…\n",

Service was helpful and friendly, especially the young gentleman who helped us with our bags upon arrival and checked us out when we left.  Room had a balcony with pleasant views of the street, but if you  book one of the more expensive rooms you will get an Acropolis view.  The restaurant has excellent food (try the loukomades \"honey dumplings\" starter) and outstanding views of the Acropolis.  Did not try the hot tub on the 4th floor but the view from there is just as good.  Hotel sitting areas were beautifully decorated and wish I had more time to enjoy it.

Front desk and bellhop services were helpful, efficient and friendly.   The rooms are small but about right for Europe.   One tip, if you are already springing for the superior room, spend the extra money for the suite, it has much more room.  Also, the Acropolis view rooms are cool but your main view is of a schoolyard next door with the ruins high above.  The breakfast buffet was decent with lots of options.   If the rooftop bar is open, don’t miss the evening view of the Acropolis and the museum.\n",

Helpful reception staff who helped me add on an extra night to a previous booked stay, although we did ask a few times for a late check out room and kept getting told to ask the next day. Eventually we just checked out normal time and it was fine, the hotel kept our luggage safe, and were very accommodating when I took back extra bits I had purchased to add to our luggage pile. They also called us a taxi back to the airport and helped us with our luggage into the taxi. The view from the roof is breath taking although we didn't eat at the restaurant as we was so busy with other things. Buffet breakfast was plentiful, with plastic gloves…\n",

It is right next door to the Acropolis museum and a 5 min walk from the side entrance to the Acropolis.  The streets are tree-lined and beautiful.

The regular room is standard European room (aka small, tight quarters) but the floor felt like it has some dips in it and the shower design had water rushing out so we had to put down towels to act as a barrier.

The room (no. 320) had the view to die for, waking up to see the Acropolis while lying in bed was a thrill. It's well worth paying the extra money & having a small balcony to sit out on as well. We ate in the restaurant on our last evening & had a wonderful meal. Not cheap but as far removed from souvlaki & chips as it was possible to be!

Really helpful, smily and nice  What could have been improved: - as there where not a lot of guests, we would have expected to be…\n",

      "Review is :Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Perfectly located with a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis and to lovely restaurants and basically where you want to be in Athens. Plaka is a 10 minute walk which is a beautiful square with lovely shops, bars and restaurants and a great night life with a brilliant atmosphere.  Hotel staff were lovely and helpful especially George Kalantzis one of the reception staff. George seemed to single handedly run the hotel and always had a smile on his face. He was so helpful, providing us with details about the city and places to go and his own recommendations. Without him our visit would not have been half as good. The rooftop restaurant was lovely with good food and friendly staff. Highly highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Furthermore, the location is perfect with a short walk to the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, and Temple of Zeus.

The balcony was big enough only for one person really and had no furniture (other rooms had bigger balconies w a table and chairs). The breakfast was pretty good.

Since I have 3 rooms, I have given 3 seperate vouchers worth 15 euros each.   On our last night, I tried to bring my family to have desert at the bar restaurant of the hotel, I was told that I can only use 1 x 15euro voucher instead of 3 and it cannot be charge for drinks (not even a beer). This is because the hotel said that I cannot combine the vouchers. Valid point... But to me, this is unfair as all the occupants of the 3 rooms are there. So, effectively, we are not combining the voucher, we were occupants of different rooms sitting together.   So, instead of arguing with them, we proceeded to order. When our order is less…\n",

The hotel staff spared no effort to live up to the expectations of their clients; reception and restaurant team, as well as room service. You can always sense the dedication and motivation driving the hotel management and employees alike. Ofcourse, the location is more than prime, with the acropolis and it’s museum, the subway station and restaurants within a 3 min walk.  The only minor downside here is the room sizes which are a bit on the smaller side of matters - Only an issue if you are a big bunch.

Also easily accessible are the restaurants of the Plaka district and the main hop on hop off bus stop opposite Hadrian’s Arch.

A local friend recommended staying at the Herodion Hotel, an upscale boutique 3 star hotel.  I was a little suspicious because the rate was only 106 euros a night, including taxes and breakfast.  All I can say is that I wish I could have extended my stay there.  First, the location is incredible, right across from the iconic Acropolis Hill, with spectacular views at night of all of Athens from the rooftop garden.  The room was comfortable and it came with an ultra modern bathroom with a rain shower.  It even provided a nightly turn down service.  The hot buffet breakfast was delicious.  The staff was extremely friendly and efficient.  This was by far one of the best values…\n",

Comfortable well equipped rooms, wonderfully friendly and helpful staff in a great location for accessing the historical area. Standard fare at breakfast in a well equipped breakfast room. Very pleasant bistro area with nice food at reasonable prices. Within easy walking distance of numerous restaurants selling good authentic Greek food as well. Had an excellent short break in pleasantly warm weather in late November with so much to see and do. Walked miles rather than using the tourist hop on buses to get a real fuel of the places.\n",

We had found a taxi driver and couldn't figure out how get ahold of him the next day so the concierge helped us do the number and get a hold of him. Easy access to and from the airport, only about a 30 minute drive. We went in the off season and lots of things were still open.  As for the taxi driver, if you're ever in Athens, and want a very sweet, helpful, informative driver I have included a picture of his business card in my photos.\n",

We struggled to make the air con cool down the room sufficiently at night. The bathroom was modern with a lovely walk in shower.  We ate one night in the restaurant and the food was excellent.

Lucky indeed that the walls are covered in some sort of spongey cladding - thus must be in case you go completely bonkers.

My husband and I had dinner twice at The Point, the hotel's restaurant which has a spectacular view of the Parthenon. The website photos do not deceive. The food there was wonderful - the salmon was probably the best I have had in my life. And the Loukamades were a fun discovery. Try them if you go.  Breakfast was also great - so many good choices! Staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.\n",

Also, a lovely view of same from the top floor patio bar (and, we were lucky to get the same view from our room). The included breakfast was very decent. Nothing out of the ordinary, but you'd be hard-pressed not to find something you liked. I highly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again.\n",

I was worried about the size since I'd never stayed in a single room before but I was very happy. There were also amenities like robes and slippers, 4 different types of pillows, etc provided in the room. The room was clean. Service from reception and the bellhops were excellent. Quick check ins and checkouts. Had drinks and dinner at the rooftop restaurant. It really does have amazing views. And the location can't be beat: we were able to walk to the Acropolis, Acropolis museum, Hadrian's Arch, Temple of Zeus, Syntagma Square, and explore Plaka in one day (yes it was a very long day, but doable considering the location of the hotel). In short,…\n",

They did everything they could to make us comfortable in our horrible situation. Lucas was the main driver, and was more than accommodating when we needed our catch up flight boarding passes printed ( three different times) as the situation changed. The Australian Embassy were also brilliant and I had my new emergency passport in my hands the very next day, so off to the island of Mykonos the catch the cruise ship.  I have to say the Lucas was calm and reassuring, and had some beautiful comforting words for my wife who was quite distressed about the whole situation, and I thank him…\n",

The breakfast, which is included, has a nice variety and the coffee is good. The room I had was TINY with no view, but overall fine for what I needed. However, every night I stayed, early in the morning (around 1:30am) the noise level of doors shutting, etc. was a bit much. Further, the hallways are not air-conditioned- so it's a bit stuffy all the time. The staff is cordial and helpful. Overall, I was happy with my stay and would stay again.\n",

Front desk staff was stellar, as were the porters and the complimentary breakfast was good.   The rooftop dinner is magical. Get a reservation before you go to make sure you have diinner or at least dessert up there. Truly a breathtaking view of the acropolis.

The location offers easy access to the Acropolis Museum as well as the site itself, and is easy to reach via subway from the airport. In walking distance of many restaurants and shops as well. Staff are helpful and the rooms are clean and comfortable.\n",

Aircon was set to a standard temperature which was just about OK  Breakfast was OK - nothing special, nothing bad. Fresh orange juice was lovely •\tDinner at the rooftop restaurant is a must: the view is stunning and the food, whilst fully priced is outstanding. My sea bream ceviche and fillet steak were very good. •\tWIFI worked very well •\tDrinks are expensive, at least for Brits with the current state of the £ •\tWe enjoyed the roof top jacuzzi after a hard day's sighseeing. •\tThe Acropolis Museum is very near and an essential visit.

The great:  The rooftop bar and restaurant (truly fabulous views, excellent food, fair price); the staff, particularly the front desk and bell staff, and bar and restaurant staff - very warm while also being highly professional; the location (just a block and a half from the subway, a hop and a skip to the New Acropolis Museum, etc.); the price, which was very competitive.

The main attractions in Athens are the historical sites, such as the Acropolis, Hadrian's Library, the Agora etc. All these sites are 10-15 minutes walking distance from the hotel, which helps you save on taxis, which are quite expensive. The other advantage of the location is that all the street tavernas and restaurants are also just one lane away. The rooms had all the basic amenities that you need, including airconditioning. The breakfast was outstanding  The staff, especially at the front desk, were extremely polite and helped us with the sightseeing tours and good places to eat.\n",

Though the rooftop restaurant was closed, being the winter season, the other restaurant was very good but of course with a limited choice.

The front desk staff was quite helpful in holding out luggage, waiting for us to check in and directing us to the restaurant.  They also arranged a taxi for us for dinner and to get to our cruise ship.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was outstanding with many choices.  We would definitely return.\n",

      "Review is :Athens was the 1st stop for our Greek holiday. We chose the Herodian over more expensive luxurious hotels due to location. We loved our stay, could not of had a better location, easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go, especially the big ticket “ancient” attractions, and certainly no shortage of great food options. Very pleasant staff, clean rooms, great shower. While our room didn’t have a view of the Acropolis, the roof top bar/restaurant did. Some great cocktails, sensational food as well. (Not the place to go in a hurry - like most places in Greece). Really the only downside to this hotel was space in the room. Bed was comfortable, marble bathroom, just small with no storage. We didn’t unpack as really no drawers or cupboard space and none in the bathroom. This is a small…\n",

      "Review is :I picked the Herodion Hotel based on its view of the Acropolis, and of course, TripAdvisor's ratings - we were not disappointed with either. The view of the Acropolis from our balcony was breathtaking, especially at night with it lite.  The junior suite was spacious, with a large bedroom, w/king sized bed, facing the Acropolis.  The sitting room was nice, with couch, chairs and a wall mounted TV (also one in the bedroom).  The bathroom was adequately sized (though counter space is limited), the shower was large.  The rooms, halls, and lobby were all very clean.

Although the rooms are very small, they have everything you need. The hotel is right next to the street that the Acropolis Museum is in and close to the plaka and the main pedestrian thoroughfare around the bottom of the Acropolis. You are close to everything but not amongst the bustle so it is perfect.  I would get up and run every morning and as Athens is a late starting city, I would often be jogging around the Acropolis with just a few other runners and a few dogs and cats for company. It was magical. No bustle and plenty of stunning sites as you made your way through the route.  I would highly recommend the hotel's roof top restaurant. The food was amongst…\n",

The room was spacious and comfortable, unfortunately it wasn’t soundproofed so I could hear everyone outside. This wasn’t that big of a problem though.  The breakfast wasn’t that good, not a lot of variety and some of it was cold if you went down a little too late. However the pancake bites (I can’t remember the name!) were absolutely splendid!

The roof top restaurant and bar is amazing with incredible views of the Acropolis and Parthenon. The food is excellent both in the garden restaurant and the rooftop one. The breakfast spread was really great as well. The rooms and lobby are immaculately clean and the lobby has a wonderful sitting area with couches and books.

      "Review is :I shall leave aside a checking in debacle that left my wife in tears and instead focus on some key problems with the hotel.   The rooms are tiny, walls are thin and work is currently underway on the top floor making a lot of noise. The plug in our room was also hanging out of the wall exposing love wires.   If you pay extra for a room for a view, you end up over looking a school (more noise) but the view is spectacular. But that’s thanks to the Acropolis.   A final low point is the mediocre buffet breakfast.   Highlights are the decor of the communal areas and some staff are incredible. The hotel is also very clean.   There is no doubt that the location of this hotel is incredible and is, in my opinion, the absolute strongest point of this place.\n",

The hotel is in a great location, the staff are very friendly.  The rooms are small but efficient.  The bathrooms are also small but beautifully decorated - loved the marble!  The bed is quite firm but comfortable.  Some rooms have little balconies, some have Juliet balconies.  There are many options for restaurants nearby and of course the hotel is very close to the Acropolis and some rooms have views.  If your room doesn't, you can go up to the roof where the hot tubs are for some great views.  The hotel includes a nice buffet breakfast with something for everyone - lots of options and all yummy.

Located just next to the Acropolis Museum and just about 500 metres away from The Acropolis, this was an outstanding hotel with excellent professional yet friendly service at all occasions. Beginning from the front office desk to each and every member at the hotel were very efficient in their service and left nothing to be asked for. Rooms on all the nights were very good. While people will obviously prefer the Acropolis view rooms, having stayed on both sides, I would say the street facing rooms are equally good, with a big balcony that gives a panoramic view of the surroundings.

The location is simply perfect, walking distance to the Acropolis and some really great restaurants. Staff is friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and in good condition, bathrooms are clean and well appointed. The breakfast is also pretty good (I’ve only ever had breakfast at the hotel so can’t really comment on anything else, but I assume everything offered is equally good). One piece of advice: request a room at the end of the corridor (independent of floor), but facing the street, not the interior of the hotel. The rooms at the end of the corridor, for example 308 and 309, have the…\n",

We had decided to spend New Year's Eve this time : a pleasant creative dinner was organized by the hotel and everyone went upstairs to see the fireworks with the Acropolis in the background. Unforgettable, in spite of the rain that night... The hotel, we noticed, is as pleasant in Winter as in Summer, with a big fireplace close to the bar. Our room was not large enough but the balcony made up for that.

The strengths of the hotel are undoubtedly its position in easy walking distance of the major tourist sites and its staff who were unfailingly friendly and helpful. Its main weak point is probably the rooms which, as others have said, are generally on the small side but are clean and reasonably well equipped.

I would like to say a special thank you to the girl in the breakfast restaurant who made my Cappuccino in the morning. The location cannot be faulted, right next to the Acropolis and museum, next to lots of nice restaurants and near the city.

The hotel put me in touch with an excellent transportation service which met us at the airport and then later took us to the port - at 6AM!  The hotel itself was well appointed, the rooms comfortable, the buffet breakfast delicious and the staff very willing to assist in any way.  It helped that the location was walking distance to the Acropolis and the Museum and to the Plaka shopping and dining neighborhood.  Lastly, the rooftop restaurant, with its excellent view of the Parthenon, was wonderful.  The food was delicious and the prices reasonable - we ate there twice.

The male receptionist was outside and helped us in with the bags. The welcome was warm, friendly and genuine. There was a lift up to our floor. During our stay, we did not have any trouble with the keycards.  To be honest, when I first arrived in the room, I was disappointed as, it had 2 twin beds, very low to the floor and when I sat on it, it was too hard. I contacted reception to ask to move to a room with a double bed, of which there were none available. However, they found…\n",

We could see the Acropolis from the pool and patio and the Museum also.  As we walked around, we came upon Zeus's Temple and were within 10 minutes walking distance from all the ruins and sights. The staff was very nice and friendly, rooms clean and comfy, and the daily breakfast was great.  Would highly recommend.\n",

I don't mind paying for a nice hotel, but I've never found what I consider a great hotel downtown.  And, as with any European capital, it's tough to make a great urban hotel - too many people and cars, too much noise, too little space, etc.  The Herodion was recommended by a friend as a nice, affordable alternative, so we decided to give it a try.  There are many good things that I must say about the Herodion.  Most important were the wonderful staff members, who were very nice and helpful.  They went out of their way to give us information and provide help, even arranging for a doctor and carefully directing us to the weekend pharmacy.  The breakfast was very nice. …\n",

We never ate in the hotels Point A restaurant as there was too much choice outside to explore; we did however sit on the rooftop lounge the first night, but we had to wait ages for cocktails to be made even after complaining twice about where they were; so this put us off going up there for the rest of the remaining nights we had.

The air conditioner battled at times but then in fairness it was extremely hot in Athens at the end of summer.

The location is amazing with a very short walk to the base of the acropolis and other sites around Athens.   The views from the rooftop bar and complimentary use of the jacuzzi which has an outstanding view of the Parthenon made this hotel very special.

The restaurant has a lovely view of the Acropolis which is beautifully lit at night, but it is very small & books out quickly but they don’t mention that in the brochure or internet.  So having arrived late and hungry because the ferry was 2 hours late, I had to opt for the bar menu instead. Service for drinks is very slow and eventually I had to go up to the bar after sitting around for 15mins to order. Plus the music was way too loud. If the view of the Acropolis wasn’t so good I wouldn’t have wasted my time tonight.

The \"window\" looked into the room opposite so you couldn't open the curtains so effectively there wasn't any natural light. It was explained to me that the website explained this but I couldn't see it...SO BEWARE if you like natural light in your room.  The hallway and room also has a horrendous drain smell to the point it kept me awake.  Finally, the service was hit and miss. I enquired about the show at the acropolis/odeon and one member of staff didn't help at all, \"don't know why the box office is shut sir\" was his retort to my enquiry. A…\n",

It is perfectly located, near the Acropolis and in walking distance of Syntagma Square with wonderful little streets filled with restaurants, shops, art galleries and wine bars nearby. The staff were exceptionally helpful with one of the gentleman on reception offering us a better room than the one we’d booked at the last minute. Nothing was too much trouble for any member of staff; they went out of their way to be both helpful and kind. The roof terrace is lovely, the dinner we had at Point A was superb. The waiting staff at the restaurant are personable, fun and professional. We loved the simplicity of the decor…\n",

Room was silent despite some building work outside and the rooftop bar and restaurant by night. Personnel was very helpful. breakfast is ok.

Complimentary breakfast served. Very close to many restaurants, train station, Acropolis site south entrance & the Acropolis Museum...by close, I mean a 2-minute walk. We had heard about how unsafe Athens was, compared to the rest of Greece. We weren’t going to let that hamper us, but still weren’t going to stroll around & wander about like we did in the Greek Islands. There were many times you'd simply turn a corner off a main drag and feel unsafe---so know where you are going. The rooftop restaurant & bar in the hotel were nothing special...we spent very little time at the bar at night & never ate there. …\n",

It was great to see so many Greek kids and teenagers discovering ancient Greek history. (You'd never get that in UK)  Lovely welcome from very professional staff at hotel and efficient departure. Good breakfast. Decent size room with small (useless) balcony overlooking Rovertou Galli. Cool swimming pool  would have been preferable to too-hot jacuzzi.  Restaurant was a bit disappointing. Lovely roof-top venue but meal didn't live up to expectations, and dishes did not seem to contain all the ingredients listed on the menu, accompanied by over-loud disco music. Stay here but don't eat here.\n",

He informed us that the booking made was for a single not a double room. As they were fully sold out we unfortunately had to keep the single room. Although a cute and cozy room, definitely claustrophobic for 2 people with very little moving space. The next morning the front desk was very helpful in coordinating our move to a different room. The second room was much more spacious. Daily breakfast was ok. Nothing amazing but definitely not bad. Location is absolutely perfect. We walked everywhere. You’re walking distance to the best sites and Plaka. Plaka has so many adorable restaurants and stores. Overall it was a lovely experience.\n",

Aside from being close to the Acropolis and the museum, there are many restaurants nearby (check out Liondi's) and a close walking distance to Plaka, which I'm sure you'll want to visit.  Had a low floor room so the view was non-existent. Bed was a little firm and left some to be desired. Bathroom was pleasant and modern. Friendly staff.

The hot tub gives an amazing overlook of Acropolis or you can go over to the bar to relax over some drinks with the same incredible view. The location is fantastic since it is just a block away from a stop for all of the tourist buses, right next door to the Acropolis museum, and a short walk from the rest of the historical areas of the city.

The hotel also benefits from very close proximity to the Plaka area and the excellent Hop On/ Off bus tours have a stop 100m from the hotel which was tremendous.

We returned with our friends on that Friday eve ,due to the amazing view and food and they loved it also ! After dinner we had dessert at your main floor bar area and the young lady was so very nice! Special mention to her,if only I could remember her name,!!!\n",

There are also many restaurants and shops within close walking distance.  There is a rooftop bar and restaurant with amazing views of the Acropolis, plus you can get some drinks to enjoy (we only had drinks, did not eat there).  For convenience, the hotel also helps arrange through a third party transportation to and from the airport which was very helpful.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Athens.\n",

      "Review is :Easy to give a five star rating to this excellent hotel. For a start, you are going to struggle to find a hotel in Athens with a better location. You are smack in the middle of the tourist area, virtually next door to the Acropolis Museum, and easy walking distance to the Acropolis, the Plaka, and other major sites. I wouldn't call the Herodion a cheap hotel, but I felt that it offered excellent value for money.  The hotel itself is nicely appointed. Rooms are small (by Australian standards, but pretty standard by European standards), but clean and well appointed. Wifi is reliable and works well at a reasonable speed--again, good for Greece.  The rooftop restaurant here is an absolute gem, and I'll be writing another review about that. But do yourself a favour and treat yourself…\n",

Our two adjoining rooms looked over the Acropolis, and were well furnished with comfortable amenities including very nice bathroom facilities for a hotel in this part of the city.

The staff were excellent though if there was a fault it was in the breakfast room where you were rather left to your own devices. [If you want a 'clever' coffee all you have to do is ask but they don't seek you out to offer it - unlike the staff in the Point, their excellent, tasty bar/restaurant up on the roof-top.]  Not all rooms have a view of the Parthenon so if that is important, check you have it.  Room size is fine and the facilities worked well.  Very happy to return.- thanks Herodion\n",

I read some of the bad reviews and not sure what those people were complaining about. The service and the staff were simple amazing, helpful and so informative.   Our room was clean and prefect for what we needed for 2 nights stay. The breakfast was included which was great and we thought it was great selection. I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

The breakfast buffet was a great way to start the day off and had lots of choices to pick from. The rooftop bar and restaurant was a great place to unwind after a long day with a fantastic view of the Acropolis. The great thing was the location. It was literally a block from the Acropolis Museum. I highly recommend to visit museum before going to the Acropolis I believe it was 6 euros per person and really worth visiting. Also super easy to walk up to the Acropolis from this location. Just ask for a map at the front desk. I loved that we could walk out our hotel take a left and walk a few blocks up and take a left into the walking area…\n",

(My husband bought me a beautiful bracelet from Pho Byzantino on Areopagitou street). The desk staff was extremely helpful in providing directions and answering our many questions on Greece. We ate twice at the rooftop restaurant and both meals were excellent. We also really enjoyed the buffet breakfast which had all the things good Greek hotel breakfasts have plus a homemade items that varied each day. (The yogurt was especially good).

Beds were comfortable, room was fine, and view was of a wall and looking down you saw the breakfast room. From the time we got to the hotel to the time we left (thank god we were only there 3 nights), a new problem arose each day. Mostly due to lack of communication from all departments of this hotel. From the reservations department, to the front desk staff, to the restaurant staff - it was like they weren't even working under the same roof. A lot of promises made to us that were not kept. To start, we had 2 people back out of our trip, which resulted in a room cancellation, that was done 5 days prior to arrival. We were told the money…\n",

The hotel itself is perfectly located. 5 mins walk from the entrance to the Acropolis and right next door to the Acropolis museum. The sun bed floor and the roof restaurant (Point a) had a perfect view of the Parthenon. Breakfast was good, with universal appeal, without being luxurious.

Our stay included a very good hot and cold breakfast buffet with lots of choices for all age groups. We utilized the bar a couple of times for a cool refreshment as the temperature outside hovered between 30⁰C (86⁰F) to 32⁰C (90⁰F) in the shade.

After checking trip advisor for the top hotels in Athens this came out as number two in terms of top reviews and value for money. Right now I am reconsidering even using online travel apps as a resource because of this bad experience.  We arrived at 10 PM expecting a standard welcome and instead we saw a group of 3-4 middle-aged men by the door who were laughing and throwing some comments in Greek and one started touching our bag trying to carry it. Thankfully our taxi driver saw and informed us that they did not work for the hotel so i immediately held our bags and at that moment the bellboy appeared too late.

The public rooms are charming and inviting, bedrooms are comfortable, and the location is ideal. It's right by the Acropolis Museum and the entrance to the Acropolis itself, but in a quiet neighborhood.  The rooftop bar is lovely and we enjoyed ending our days there with a cocktail and view of the Parthenon. The restaurant is excellent and the staff welcoming and very helpful. We will definitely stay there again when we return to Athens.\n",

Rooms are efficient and clean, but you didn't come to Athens for the room. The hotel staff is excellent - the bellmen and reception are first rate. The only drawback to the hotel is the large number of group travelers who descend on the breakfast room prior to their tour bus pickups. For this grade of hotel, perhaps that's unavoidable. Still, a very comfortable and convenient choice for your Athens home base.\n",

The hotel is in a good location, the next street over from the acropolis museum and a short walk from the parthenon and Hadrian's arch.

The flavours of every dish were incredible. Even my husband commented on how there was sweet, savoury and different textures and colours on each plate. Amazing chef skills.

We were very pleased with this hotel and highly recommend it for a little bit of elegance in a busy city. We ate at several restaurants right next to the hotel and had wonderful meals. On our last day at the Herodion, we had to leave very early to catch our flight and they gave us coffee and baked goods at 5am and arranged a ride to the airport. Everything was flawlessly executed. They have a lovely view of the acropolis from their rooftop restaurant, which wasn't yet open for service, but we spent time up there enjoying the view. The staff were exceptionally kind and I highly recommend this for a great place to stay in Athens.\n",

I arrived 2 hours before check in and while I was waiting in the lobby they offered me a free coffee and made sure I was comfortable. On top of the wonderful staff, the rooms are VERY clean, the beds are comfortable, the morning breakfast is delicious, and the location is great! You can walk to pretty much any museum or landmark from this hotel and if there is something you want to see thats further away the staff will help you get a cab or direct you to the Metro.

The entrance lobby was nice but the upper one was so lovely!  The rooms are very comfortable and there was this super young lady at reception who helped us out with changing our room as I am sensitive to noise (which came from rowdy people on the tiny street (not traffic) and which didn't bother my husband at all as he is a good sleeper).    For my own credibility I'll be honest and admit that breakfast was poor;  all I need is a freshly fried egg or two and toast (which was super actually), and if there are pastries they should be oven fresh and crisp.  I had heard about that but it was not a consideration in my choice and I am so glad.   There is a…\n",

Twice she has tried to pay and each time they refused to accept money.

The mind cleans 2 x a day, even though there is really no need. I asked her not to because my room did not need it. We were on the top floor but not over looking the Acropolis, which was fine because we had a Hugh balcony.  The jacuzzi on the roof top garden was nice for us to relax in and get the view of the Acropolis day and night. Definitely recommend this hotel.

It has a nice atmosphere with the olive tree, but most importantly, they serve pretty delicious food. I can recommend it! The breakfast was also good.

Over the course of our stay, we walked completely around the Acropolis several times and saw great sites.  The Acropolis Museum is a block away.  The roof top seating and view was awesome.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely choose the Herodion for our next stay.\n",

      "Review is :We booked the Herodion hotel because of the proximity to the Acropolis and the supposedly 4* and reviews. The staff were friendly, breakfast was the same everyday and the bathroom was tiny but at least it looked fairly new. You can't control the temperature in the room so we were freezing the first night and boiling hot the other nights. Unfortunately they gave us a twin room and didn't have any doubles. The beds were uncomfortable with a mattress so thin, it was little better than a camp bed, instead of duvets you get the cheap, scratchy blankets. Worse of all, my husband suspected he was bitten by bed bugs and returning home we are both covered in bites and having to deal with the paranoia of whether we had brought them to our home now!  I've stayed in a lot of hotels, but…\n",

The Herodion hotel boasts a professional and friendly staff, delicious and varied breakfast as well as a perfect location to walk around Athens. The hotel staff, especially Neili, were extremely helpful with my mother who has limited mobility. In fact, they provided us a room on the ground floor to accommodate her.  The breakfast (7am—10am) included hot and cold dishes (scrambled/fried/hard-boiled eggs, bacon, sausages, pastries, yogurt, cheeses, freshly squeezed juices, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc.,). All facilities were wonderfully clean.   The safe and mini-fridge in the room were very useful and the beds were clean and comfortable.  The rooftop garden…\n",

No need to pay  more for Acropolis view - just head for the roof garden and enjoy a great view, day and light (illuminated). Plentiful choices for breakfast. Decent working space in business area. Good bar with lots of comfy chairs and sofas- a lone traveller would not feel uncomfortable having a drink there. We didnt try the restaurant this time, or the jacuzzis, sadly, as it was a bit chilly in the afternoon. Pity the American high school kids were such noisy brats, but not the hotel's fault, and earplugs do the trick at night. Will definitely try to book here for next visit.\n",

The Herodion Hotel is perfectly situated to enjoy the ancient monuments of Athens. The view of The Acropolis from room 410 was spectacular; particularly at night when it is lit up.   The hotel is a short walk to the parliament building, where watching the changing of the guard on the hour is a must. The museum is amazing and well worth a visit too.  I truly believe that it's the people who work in these hotels that makes a place special and make you want to return. From reception (late checkout was no problem), bar staff, waiters and to housekeeping, EVERY staff member was friendly and welcoming.   Cocktails and food in the restaurant was superb. The rooms were clean and…\n",

The good: Great location, good price for value, very close to many attractions (Acropolis, Acropolis museum, Parliament, Temples of Zeus, Hefaistos etc). Metro station and tram station near the hotel Very good breakfast Some good restaurants within walking distance Lobby bar/restaurant (Atrium) is worth mentioning too Excellent cleaning staff. Great view of the Acropolis Many thanks to reception staff for both changing our room the next day of our arrival (the first one had joined twin beds and we asked for a large bed) and also for allowing us to make a late checkout (2h:30min after the mandatory check-out) Decent WiFi…\n",

I could see our Jacuzzi from the Parthenon and I could see the Parthenon from our Jacuzzi.  The hotel interior is clean and stylish but still comfortable. There is an open fireplace beyond the lobby with nice sofas and books near the lovely bar and restaurant. It has a relaxed, cosmopolitan vibe but manages to feel traditional and 'Greek' at the same time. The staff are LOVELY. We love Room Service and I was struck by the fact that food from Room Service is no more expensive than eating in the restaurant. The waiting and staff and chef were so kind.  The rooms are clean and quiet.  I really like this hotel!\n",

We had eaten in a number of local Greek restaurants where the food was in some ways tastier than that at the Herodion, and certainly much less expensive, which is why I gave it a 4. However, our meal was very well prepared and more refined than the food we had eaten elsewhere in Greece. Also, the setting is beyond wonderful, and the service is excellent. I will definitely eat here again the next time I am in Greece.\n",

The hotel has many, many strong points to recommend it as the ideal place to stay in Athens. First, and foremost, the hotel staff are incredibly friendly, accomodating, polite, and helpful. They assisted us with obtaining transportation to and from the airport, made recommendations on restaurants, helped us mail postcards and offered advice on sightseeing. The hotel bar and restaurant are very nice and breakfast was included in our stay. The hotel, which appears to be recently remodeled and was very clean, offers room service as well. The location itself is perfect to explore Athens by foot or metro being as it sits at the foot of the Acropolis and is a 5 minute…\n",

There also is the view of the Acropolis but, more importantly, the food is of very high quality and with original dishes. So different to the \"chips with moussaka\" and \"couldn't care less\" attitude of so many places in the Plaka, nearby. We took a Greek lawyer friend and he was amazed. We stayed in July 2017 and I meant to review then, but I recently saw a review by someone who compared Herodion to the Marriott. This is not a large hotel, but it has a family atmosphere, with all the staff being so helpful. I noted the names of Sophia and Litsa, but…\n",

The Herodion's spacious modern rooms, carefully prepared and expansive breakfasts, winning bar and bistro, and, most of all, ever welcoming and friendly staff made us instantly feel at home and ready to return at the first available instance. The hotel is centrally located for the Acropolis sites (and museum!), a brief stroll to the shops and restos of Plaka and Monastiraki, and not far from the posh precincts of Kolonaki.\n",

The lobby and the bar area are comfortable and silent.   The Location: Perfect for history lovers. It is conveniently located to the Plaka region and very close to the Acropolis. A mere 5 minute walk leads to the entrance to the site. The Plaka region is about 10 minute in a strolling mode.   The Rooms: We stayed in room 116. In overall the rooms are clean, new and fresh. Ours was not large but comfortable and sufficient. We did not have a lot luggage, so had no problem moving around the room. However, the room needed more natural light, but this has to do with the location of the building itself. Many…\n",

The beds and linen were of a high quality and the whole place was spotless. The view of the Acropolis from our room was stunning and mesmerising.  The hotel staff are professional, polite and friendly ranging from the lovely people at the Reception desk to the lovely ladies who clean the room brilliantly.  We used the hot tub on the top floor almost every day and its difficult to over emphasise the wonderful feeling of luxuriating in a hot tub while looking across at one of the worlds greatest monuments.

Our room was fairly big (for Europe), the lobby glamorous, the breakfast spread impressive. And if you're lucky enough to snag a room with a Parthenon view, more power to you. The Acropolis itself is a short, pleasant walk from the hotel, as is the Acropolis Museum and many restaurants.  That said, no matter how nice a hotel is, you still want a good night's sleep. Our bed was comfortable, the blackout curtains were great, and the neighborhood itself is dead quiet at night, especially facing the Acropolis.

The roof top views are awesome of the Accropolis. The room was very clean, and had all amenities. Breakfast is varied and good. I did not eat in the restaurant. I felt this hotel was well worth the cost and would stay here again.\n",

All the information we needed was given by the receptionist who was very polite. Politeness and friendliness turned out to be the red thread woven entirely through the fabric of our stay.  The room we were assigned was, by capital city centre standards, large enough and very clean. All the equipment in the room and bathroom was in good order and worked well. The beds were very comfortable.  Breakfasts were good and more in the Greek style than the British or American style. However, bacon, eggs and sausage were available along with Greek delicacies.  The atrium bar / restaurant was comfortable but the roof-top dining experience was wonderful.…\n",

As they have steps leading up to the hotel I needed help getting the pram up and down multiple times a day and their staff were always on hand, friendly and accommodating. The lobby, ground floor restaurant and roof terrace were newly renovated and lovely. We had excellent food the one day we ate there. What lets the hotel down are the rooms, which are small and have a lot of wear and tear. They are dated with impractical furniture and really too small if one is a family with a child. However, the location is just unbeatable and the overall experience was great.\n",

It is no more than a 30 minute walk from almost everything you might want to visit in Athens. The staff is friendly and reasonably helpful, but be prepared to carry your own bags particularly on check out. The rooms are very simple almost to the point of being spartan, and quite small with no really comfortable seating but they are clean and basically adequate. The rooms with a view of the Acropolis also have a view of a school yard so be prepared for the sound of happy kids early in the morning. There is a rooftop bar with a good view of the Acropolis, but getting a drink here at cocktail time is a challenge. When we tried, they had to send down to the lobby bar…\n",

However, I think the hotel could do better when it comes to environmental awareness. While there is a notice in the bathroom about leaving the towels on the ground means please change them otherwise do not take them away, the hotel would change the towels every day and would also even change the soap! They also changed the bin(plastic) bag from the room every day even if there was only one chocolate wrap in the bin bag. We appreciated that they wanted to keep our rooms clean but it was really unnecessary to change towels and soap every day. I think in Athens 2017 they could do better in environmental efficiency.\n",

A few minutes, you are at the ticket both.  The Acropolis Museum entrance is less than 3 blocks. Across the street is a snack and newspaper kiosk and also our most favorite coffee house, the Little Tree Coffee and Books. A gift shop is on the same block. There are also neighborhood grocery stores a block or two around the area. My favorite taverna, To Kati Allo is one and a half blocks away. The Plaka is a short walk away.

Nevertheless, I hope that the 3 weeks we travelled all over Greece makes this review somewhat credible.  Positive:  location, right next to the acropolis museum (3 to 5 min walk) , 5 - 7 min walk to acropolis metro station. And very close to the acropolis. The area is not full of graffiti like some other area of Athens, so the walk also feel reasonably safe.

You just can't beat the location... EVERYTHING is within walking distance, but since you're on \"the other side of the Acropolis,\" (read:  not in Plaka) you don't have the hoards of tourists or trinket shops.  The Acropolis Museum is literally in the next block.  Accordingly, every one of the three \"Hop On / Hop Off\" bus stops are also right there.  So, Athens and its environs are just in the next (city = short) block.  As to the Hotel, we couldn't have asked for more.  We had room 401 and 405 - the corner rooms.

You can easily walk to the historic sites, restaurants, and shopping areas.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, and well maintained.  Our housekeeper Ioanna was absolutely lovely, friendly, helpful, and kept our room in tip top shape.  The bar staff in the lobby bar were also very friendly and made great drinks. Their rooftop bar was also a fun place to get a drink and to view the acropolis.  The wait staff that attended the tables were eager to please, the bar tender upstairs not so much as the lovely and courteous bar tenders in the lobby bar.\n",

The hop on hop off bus even stops just a few metres down the road! Rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms.  Beds are comfortable. Staff are incredibly helpfull and as well as the wonderful rooftop bar there is another downstairs bar with comfortable armchairs and couches. Breakfast offers a great selection to choose from and even tho the fresh orange juice disappears quickly the staff are always willing to bring more.\n",

We stayed four nights and had a standard room which was minimalistic but comfortable.  Only criticism would be the tiny tv in this day and age large TVs aren’t expensive. Air con quite good and comfortable bed. The breakfast was a good start to the day with cooked ham, fried eggs. Cheese, meat, breads toast, fruit, juices and delicious rice pudding.  The staff were very friendly. We had drinks in the rooftop bar which was fantastic and had food there also. The location could not be better.  Overall delighted with the stay and would recommend for anybody looking for a traditional Greek hotel stay.\n",

The rooms are not large, the views from the rooms are not great(there are some with better views), and the closet space is limited.    That being said, YOU DONT GO TO Greece to stay in your room!

If you need ironing, etc, speak to the staff for assistance.  The breakfast is extensive and tasty, a restaurant on he 6th floor looks across to the Acropolis, so the views of this and the mountains surrounding Athens are beautiful. We had amazing service from Dimos and Alexia in the restaurant and enjoyed our time at the downstairs Bar being looked after by Helen and Stellios.

They told me places to shop for replacement clothes with clear directions on how to find them.

The breakfast buffet is excellent, and the front-desk staff are patient and helpful about such things as taxis, sites, ferries and performances.

Yes indeed location is superb for a tourist, and I really enjoyed running on the hills around the Acropolis in the early morning when there are no crowds and still no summer heat. But inside the hotel itself - beyond personnel which is very hospitable and friendly - i wasn't impressed. The hotel is visibly of a respectable age, my room was small and didn't have any natural lighting (the window, although you can open it, overlooks a tiny and fairly dark innner yard), the breakfast is inside-only (the rooftop restaurant is not for breakfast).

I liked the neighborhood as well... didn't feel seedy like other parts of Athens.   Highlight of our stay was dinner on the hotel rooftop with impressive view of the Acropolis. Loved watching the light change as the sun set. Food and cocktails were also lovely and staff very friendly.   Breakfast included was also good.\n",

It is nice to have a balcony. Recommend not booking your room through one of the agencies such as expedia, etc because you get the crappy rooms. If you can, book directly with the hotel. My original room looked like a dorm room but this was kindly changed and my second room was better furnished and clean.  Breakfast-lots of options, ok quality. Seemed good for kids. The lobby was better than expected with nice sitting areas that feel like home-big couches and chairs.

Great A/C, which is not always found in some hotels.  Great rooftop restaurant with the best view of the Acropolis AND the Parthenon. And the nighttime view of the new Acropolis museum is fantastic. Great food at good prices and the staff was perfect. We ate there three times.\n",

The hotel is ideally located with breath taking views of the Acropolis and an easy stroll to Old Town.  I have been there before on business but had to return with my family because dinner on their roof with the views of the Acropolis can't be overstated.  Their food and their Greek Salad were among the best we experienced during our 12 days in Greece.  The staff is unusually attentive.  As an example, my youngest son arrived separately from the airport.  As he entered the hotel, one of the staff casually asked how much he paid for his taxi.  The staff member said he was overcharged and ran out to the driver and made the driver refund my son the overage!  Where else have you…\n",

The staff are friendly and the location is very convenient for a walk to the Acropolis, Acropolis museum and good restaurants. The rooms are not especially memorable. Our room did not have a balcony but was very quiet. Overall the experience was nice but if it had not been for the rooftop I would not rate the hotel as particularly special.\n",

They arranged my airport pickup when I arrived and recommended a great city tour. It's right next door to the new Museum which is a must see.  Only a block to the Plaka area with great shops and restaurants.   My room was tiny with little view but it was very clean and totally worked. Great value too.    Alephoria, the hostess at the roof top restaurant, the servers, bar tenders were all friendly and accommodating.  I had a very early morning flight out and had a cheerful greeting from reception at 5:30am.  By the time my bill was settled, my cab had already arrived and the bellman had my bags taken care of.  All in the matter of five minutes…\n",

      "Review is :I stayed one night at the beginning of my trip (June 26, 2017) and one night at the end (July 3, 2017).   The positives: The lobby is gorgeous with artistic wire statues and a bar/restaurant with trees growing through it. The staff is very professional and tries to be helpful (though both times I stayed at the hotel there was not a doorman to greet me and carry my luggage up the steps but I think that was a fluke). Gorgeous rooftop bar and a nice jacuzzi area on the floor below it. However, the main reason to stay at this hotel is that it's right by THE attraction in Athens: the acropolis.   The negatives: The first room we had at the beginning of our trip literally reminded me of a hostel I'd once stayed at--the bed was a hard board looking thing with a gross looking red…\n",

It is located right next to the Acropolis Museum and at the base of the Acropolis itself which made it so easy to walk to all the sites and the restaurants and shops along the Adriano in the Plaka. After a long day on our feet we retreated to the hot tub and dinner at the rooftop restaurant both of which had an amazing view of the Acropolis. The staff was very attentive to our needs and they exchange U.S. Dollars for Euros at the front desk for a much better rate than at the airport. Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Athens to visit the historical sites!\n",

The room was a nice room, with a comfy bed and the best shower as mentioned.  We had a great stay in this modern hotel.  The view can't be beat from the rooftop of the Parthenon and Acropolis and was an easy walk to the sites in town. The bellhop held our bags after our late checkout since our flight was much later than checkout and it was easy to retrieve them. The complimentary breakfast was also a nice breakfast with great coffee, yogurt and fruits. I'd choose this hotel again if in Athens.\n",

The breakfast each morning was more than adequate, and the rooftop bar/restaurant/lounge was spectacular as it provided a unobstructed vie of the Acropolis. Magnificent. (The food was also decent.) The staff was very helpful, very pleasant and professional.

      "Review is :We chose the Herodion for the location and rooftop. Having a drink viewing the Acropolis day or night is a high point in Athens. Having it a short staircase above you is a HUGE plus. All of the key sites in Athens are short walks which also make this a fantastic location. The staff was absolutely wonderful from the bell hop to the front desk to the waitstaff, all top notch. The only downside was the small room and quite firm bed, but this is a city afterall. Also, it is adjacent to an elementary school yard, so expect kids playing in the AM if you are on the Acropolis view side of the hotel. We would definitely consider staying here again.\n",

Also on the top floor is a rooftop bar/restaurant with great views of the Acropolis and the museum.. While the room size and showers are small, they serves their purpose. Would stay here again.\n",

But, it is just fine not to have a view and to dine on the roof. To one side is the gorgeous, elegant archeological museum, and in front of the dining area is the Acropolis. The restaurant is perfect: aside from the view, the service, the decor and especially the food is so delicious. We take pride in our cooking, and rarely eat in restaurants, but the meals we have eaten at the Herodion are exemplary. The chef was kind enough to introduce himself. Each experience at the restaurant as well as the hotel feels personal.\n",

But it is the position that is outstanding, you don't just have the view but you are an easy stroll from the new Acropolis Museum, round the corner from God's Restaurant, and on the other side a gentle walk to the hill of the Pinx, and over to the Ancient Agora.

It is about 5 minutes from the nearest Metro station, virtually next door to the Acropolis Museum and about ten minutes from the Acropolis entrance.

      "Review is :Stayed 2 nights in early May.  Booked a \"superior\" double room, but could have saved my money by getting a standard room.  The \"superior\" room had a terrace which wasn't really big enough to sit out on.  All the other features of the room appear to be pretty much the same as a standard room, including a rather small TV.  Room was rather drab, as there was not a single picture, print, wall hanging or any other sort of decoration in the room.  Bathroom was nice though, and while I understand some people \"complaining\" about the small toilet seat, I've seen similar seats in many other bathrooms across Europe.  On the plus side, the price of the room included a very nice buffet breakfast, with ample selections.  Also, the hotel is situated very close to the Acropolis; very nice view…\n",

The staff were lovely. I was needing to download forms, print things, scan things - always urgently - and they just helped. Every time. One evening I treated myself to cocktails in the bar. That was nice too. It's a really well appointed, unfussy, simple but comfortable hotel. It's in a brilliant spot near said Acropolis but also in a district full of the academic institutes, so perfect for me. There is also a fab coffee shop - tree something? - across the street.

Walls so thin you can hear people having a conversation in the next room! The bed was huge, bedding and towels lovely and clean and housekeeping was excellent. We have stayed in Athens many times before and were a little disappointed with the room, over looking the school playground and didn't appreciate the noise from it at 8 a.m which continued for at least 15 minutes. My only other criticism would be the dining room where we ate breakfast, when at full capacity was like a canteen, very noisy, coffee cups and food not replenished quickly. Fortunately at the weekend it was quieter. If I had known about the school I would perhaps have booked…\n",

It is also close to most other archeological sites in the city, so it was a perfect staging point for us.  The hotel is modern with good beds and a nice bathroom.  It is normally air conditioned, but we arrived just before the system was activated, so we needed to leave the large door to the balcony open at night.  Eventually cooled down nicely.  We had a mini-suite since we were traveling with a grandchild and this worked out nicely.  Breakfasts were ample with many choices.  So, we enjoyed our stay here quite a bit.\n",

They were having fun clambering up and down the rocks but looked stultified in the museum ;-).  The hotel was expensive but clean and reasonable service. A little disappointed that the \"Air Conditioned rooms\" turned out NOT to be air conditioned - at least not  until the management decide to turn on the air conditioning \"around May\". The room was hot even though the weather was not that hot outside and with the window open at the front of the hotel, it was very noisy until after midnight.  Overall though, a very enjoyable visit with nice shopping area around Plaka.\n",

That is not what we wanted so we chose this family run hotel in the old town and it was lovely. The welcome, staff, friendliness and efficiency are fabulous. I forgot a travel plug and they gave me one for my stay. The staff remember who you are and all are very welcoming. We had a twin room overlooking the Acropolis so no balcony. I think the balcony rooms are the doubles as less room that 2 twin beds? The location is great. We got 2 trains from the airport and walked around the corner to the hotel.

This is a 4* hotel, very clean with rooms bigger than usual seen in Athens, quite (to a specific point, if you have the room in front of the school you will hear happy kids all day long), with lovely staff. But the disappointment was the breakfast. I was expecting to something more (comparing to the sister hotel Phillipos 3*) but the options were not so many: only few cucumbers and tomatoes, some feta cheese and one or two ham versions, eggs ... peaches compote  and some jam. As said, maybe it is me but I was hoping for something more fresh and more Mediterranean.  But overall a very lovely experience.\n",

The staff were very friendly and helpful- we had dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night which was great value and really enjoyable food, our waiter was excellent, and made us feel welcomed.

We walked from the hotel to Plaka (2 min), Syntagma (15-min), Monastiraki (15-min), Kermeikos (20 min), Panathinaikou Stadium (15-min), Hadrian's Arch (10 min), and on and on. And the walk to these places is not that hard either - flat lands.  Acropolis was a 5-7 min walk as well and the Acropolis was 2-min away.  The Rooftop (free) has great views of the Acropolis.   Only complaint is the wi-fi was kind of slow.\n",

The room was nice and clean, I really liked the balcony and of course the roof garden is the absolutely stunning. You can sit there, in a comfy deck chair and simply take the Akropolis view in! WOW!  Now why do I only rate this place 3/5? The internet situation is unacceptable and not worthy of a Four Star Hotel!! The internet is incredibly slow, like out of the 90s... and they know it. They said the called an engineer... but even though we were staying for three nights... the internet hardly improved.

The Herodion is conveniently located just minutes from the Acropolis Museum (a must-see), more of the ancient monuments, the Acropolis Metro line station (an all- day all-transport ticket is just €4.50 at the time of writing), Plaka with its numerous lanes to wander around and a good selection of restaurants within easy distance. Also, for those planning a longer visit there is a handy little shop to get milk, teabags etc. just two minutes from the Hotel on Kariatidon Street (up the hill, turn left onto Kariatidon, down the hill and it’s on the corner) Other reasons we decided upon the Herodion was the excellent breakfasts (home-made…\n",

Breakfast was a nice spread with a lot of choices which did not change during our stay.   A special mention has to be made of the service and the friendly staff.

Most of the view is of a basketball court. I wouldn't spend the extra money for it. You can get a better view from the restaurant or the hot tubs.The hot tubs were nice and had a great view. The only issue we had was the key card we were required to use to turn the jets on. For each hot tub, you only get 15 minutes of jets using the key card.

Staff were professional and accommodating. Nice convenience store across the street and down a block or two recommended by the front-desk staff. Our third-floor room, highlighted, with view of the Acropolis was, perhaps,  over rated. One had to view through a school-yard fence. Wasn't really worth the extra price. In future would choose a balcony facing the front street. Be sure not to miss the very top floor. This area is the hallmark of the Herodion. Superb vista of the Acropolis and environs.

I had some concerns about the location, that it wouldn't be central but it was PREFECT! Few minutes walk from the Acropolis, Plaka and New Acropolis Museum. With the plus of a Quite street.   Breakfast was nice, as a vegan I didn't have many options but asked for a soy milk and got it with a smile.  The room was clean and cozy with a really good planning and styling. There was no view from the window as Athens is so crowded, normal this would be a big issue for me but the other thing compensated.\n",

So, location is top notch!  We had a room on the first floor, which has the more affordable rooms. No views, but there was natural light! As we were not to spend much time in the room, this was totally okay with us. The rooms are decorated in a minimalistic way, which we saw elsewhere in Greece: this is the new chique. The bed was even a cocomat bed! High standards, though when you look closely you notice the wooden floor is in fact a cheap laminate floor. A bit of a contrast, so to speak.

I had a layover with a day to catch some sites. I tried to book through the TripAdvisor link which said there was no availability. I wrote to the hotel a couple of times on their website because I thought i might need 2 beds and wanted more details. They wrote back and said no availability. What was confusing is that I could easily book a room using hotels.com?   So I did book on hotels.com asking for a room with a double/king bed and a window.   Upon checking in, they gave me a room on the 1st floor which was very dark and faced a dark courtyard.

It's a stone's throw from the new Acropolis Museum, which should a a full commitment for those interested in Greek sculpture from the Archaic to the Classical. The hotel is quiet, comfortable and has two restaurants-- one on the rooftop (with a view of the Parthenon) and one in a kind of pergola/ garden just behind the main desk. Different food, both excellent.  Staff courteous and helpful, and there's a small library to orient you to Greece and to the city. A little less expensive than hotels north of the Acropolis-- and that a real plus too-- and there's a metro stop nearby with access to all of the city's lines.  Couldn't have been better.\n",

The hotel is tasteful and is located directly underneath the Acropolis... so close you can almost touch it. Check in was seamless however the room was quite basic. When in the lift you have to scan your room card to work it, which i understand from a security point of view, i reality however it is slightly annoying. The roof top bar was very busy and not surprising given the view of the Acropolis at night. Many tables in the best spots were reserved so we were stuck in a corner with no…\n",

      "Review is :Booked at Herodion based on Trip Advisor rating, but unfortunately had a poor experience. We stayed in an Acropolis facing room, which was close to the elevator and very noisy. There was a cyclical drilling type noise, (not sure if this was caused by the elevator) which made it very difficult to sleep.  The rooms are average, but adequate. Breakfast was disappointing, only poor meal we had in Greece.  At the time of our stay there was a strike by the air traffic controllers, which caused havoc for all travelers. We asked the Herodion reception if they can assist us, to contact the airline to confirm our flight. They simply refused to provide any assistance. There was another guest at reception, who also asked for assistance in speaking to the local, greek, contact to change his…\n",

It's right at the base of the Acropolis, the metro and the hop-on hop-off tourist bus stops. Furthermore, you get a free continental breakfast and restaurants are plentiful in the surrounding neighborhood. The Herodion itself has a first-class restaurant on the roof, Point A, with an jaw-dropping view of the Acropolis and the Parthenon.  However, if you want a 4-star experience in the rooms, we found that wanting. Our single room had the unfortunate resemblance to a cruise cabin, in both size and look. Our view was to other windows within the hotel, one that was used to line-dry underwear.  The bathroom had a half-glass shower, and having…\n",

Especially helpful was the porter who not only helped us with the luggage but acted as a concierge providing great travel advice and helping coordinate our trip logistics. We had to leave before breakfast started the last day and stay were nice enough to pack us box lunches for the trip. In summary, this is a great hotel and the staff really exceeds expectations.\n",

As noted elsewhere, the location is great.. 10 minute walk to the Acropolis and most ancient sites and museums. I didn't take the metro at all, except to go to the train station which is on the same line as the acropolis station, the nearest metro to the hotel. The service from reception, to dining to housekeeping was excellent as expected from an upscale hotel. The bed was also firm and comfortable, which was much needed as I got sick one day and had to spend most of the day in bed. I also looked forward to the large continental breakfast offered every morning. Excellent overall. Book it!\n",

I'm particularly grateful this time for special help from a kind gentleman from reception who assisted me with on-line check-in via the internet for my return flight. Nothing is too much trouble, for instance more teas or cutlery and glasses in the room. In fact housekeeping often come round just to see if everything is O.K.

The staff is friendly, the rooms are rather small, very nice bathroom, breakfast buffet is OK but not special. The rooftop restaurant Point a, however, is a very nice place to have a delicious dinner with a view on the Akropolis.\n",

      "Review is :My husband and I stayed here last week with a 3 other couples.This hotel is about 5-10 minutes maximum walking distance to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum which is an amazing museum, by the way. It is also close to the Plaka District which has lots of shops and restaurants.  The breakfast included is excellent, but the Point A Bar/Restaurant is fabulous.  Gorgeous view of the Parthenon at night.  The rooms are small, but modern and clean.  Although not free, the hotel also arranged for our transportation from the ferry to the hotel and then from the hotel to the airport. The staff was very accommodating. I had no complaints about the Herodion Hotel.\n",

The rooftop view is gorgeous, day or night! Don't miss it! The service was great. The breakfast buffet was loaded with a huge variety and everyone was satisfied. The bar was super accommodating. Creating drinks based on our individual preferences! The front desk helped us with all our needs from maps, taxis, and \"must see\" tips to even a house call physician (yes, our little guy got sick with a high fever!) the location is great! Walking distance to the new museum (don't miss it, it's fabulous), the Acropolis, the plaka and other great shopping districts.\n",

Their recommendations were delicious and we would highly suggest anyone stay at the Herodian Hotel in Athens and eat at the Pointa Bar & Restaurant.

We really just wanted to spend a couple of days seeing the Acropolis and everything else the Greek Capital had to offer. This hotel was perfect as it is right next to the Acropolis Museum and just a short walk away from the Acropolis itself. The hotel is also located right next to the Plaka a lovely area for restaurants and tourist shops - great vibe. We also walked from the hotel (about 20mins) to both the tomb of the unknown soldier for the changing of the guards and the centre of twin for the shopping .

Our room was small but always clean and more than adequate.   The rooftop jacuzzis were great but the time limit was very odd. You were given a card to activate the bubbles which went off after 15 minutes, which was not enough time to even have a drink delivered.  The restaurant and bar upstairs were great with the most amazing view, but you definitely need to book as it is very popular. The view of the Acropolis is very romantic.  I would recommend this hotel for couples and singles; the bar and jacuzzi area are for adults and not appropriate for children.\n",

A short, but uphill, walk to the Acropolis and the museum. We checked in around 8pm. Friendly helpful staff. Walked into the room and it was very warm. That changed when we turned up the air conditioning which worked great. Got the room nice and cold. The room is also very small by American standards. But, OK, we're only here for 2 nights. Wanted to unpack a few things. Unfortunately there is absolutely no storage. No dresser. No drawers anywhere. There's one shelf in the open closet. That's it. No real place to put your suitcases.

These rooms do overlook a school so be a little bit wary of this. We stayed when school was out so very quiet but I could see the potential for noise and the fact your balcony would not be that private if school was in. The room was very comfortable.

The hotel is next door to the new Acropolis Museum and around the corner from the Acropoli metro stop, which is on the red line.  The bed was huge, close to king size. On the 4th floor there are two hot tubs with superb views of the Acropolis. After a day of sightseeing it was a wonderful way to relax. Breakfast the next morning was excellent. Very comprehensive with something for everyone.  The staff was helpful and pleasant. A few small annoyances were the bed, although large, was on a platform and had very little give.

The hotel staff were so friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, helping deal with taxi drivers, helping us with our bags, even moving us around rooms at our request.  I truly can not say enough nice things about them. The rooms were small but had everything you need, including a well stocked mini bar.  The roof top bar is cool. If I were to do it again I would splurge for the room with a view of the parthenon!  Thanks!\n",

I booked a \"standard\" room and my daughter and I were given a garden view room on the ground floor. We asked which other rooms were available and we were kindly shown two other rooms. We kept the room originally issued to us, but appreciated the courtesy.  The wifi did not work well in our room, but it was somewhat better in the lobby.

Its a lovely, quaint hotel on a small narrow street, nice amenities, good buffet breakfast but whats great here is the location - a short walk to the Acropolis and its museum and near shopping areas. Make sure you eat on their terrace restaurant bec the view of the Parthenon at night is fantastic!\n",

      "Review is :I spent 2 nights in Hotel Herodion, had one meal in \"The Point\", the 5th floor roof restaurant and one in \"The Atrium\", the groundfloor one. The location is perfect for visiting the Acropole Museum which is distant of 200 meters and the Acropole itself, which I wanted to see again. Nice atmosphere, helpful staff, nice room, I'm most likely to return on my next visit to Athens. \"The Point\" is very successful, serve great cocktails and the menus revisit traditional Greek cuisine. Same with \"The Atrium which has no view on the Acropole but is much quieter and serve similar drinks and dishes.\n",

When my friend forgot her purse in the hotel, they went to check and sent it to the airport in its own cab! They really went out of their way for us and we were very grateful.

So, if you don't want class or luxury, as they seem to promise and fail to follow up on, then be my guest and stay.  This hotel was completely incompetent in every way. The service was the absolute worst I've experienced in Greece. My husband and I came on our honeymoon.

The only reason I cannot mark 5 stars is because the hotel did not have our booking, which did cause us minor inconvenience. However, Yannis who was on duty at the time, went out of his way to rectify the situation. He was most apologetic and offered us complimentary drinks whilst he tried to organise something for us. He arranged another hotel for us that night and took care of everything.  The next day we were able to check in to a beautiful room with acropolis view. There was a lovely fruit basket waiting for us and we were offered dinner in the rooftop restaurant, Point A. The meal and the cocktails, absolutely superb, as were the staff and the incredible view!

They held my bags the day I checked out, so I could explore the museum. I met my tour to ancient Olympia later that day.  Everyone was very accommodating. I am rating this hotel with high marks because of the workers and location. Thank you, Maria G.\n",

In the evening you can view the Acropolis and the Greek Museum that are lit up at night time.  The food is excellent and the staff are very friendly. Fotini was my waitress and she really made the evening.  The hotel also has a free breakfast that was outstanding.\n",

      "Review is :We were in and out of Athens on our last visit - first stayed at Hilton and then at Herodion.  The Hilton had a big pool and workout facilities and was more \"Americanized.\"  The Herodion felt more Athenian.  It is in the center of town, literally right next door to the Acropolis museum, and near cafes and shops.  The rooms were comfortable with modern bathrooms and some have very large balconies.  One side overlooks the Acropolis and with views impossible to beat (except in the rooftop jacuzzis and attached Point A restaurant (see separate excellent review).  Breakfast was tasty and plentiful with many homemade options.  Highly recommended for the good location and service.  The only criticism would be of the small elevator that had doors that sometimes did not open all the way…\n",

No view of the Acropolis could be more enchanting, but better yet the restaurant is sublime in food and aesthetics and service is wonderfully warm and professional. Cold slivers of sea bass starter as never tasted before, the tenderest lamb... food to sigh for and none too dear. Such a magical night, couldn't leave this place. The outdoor bar upstairs was  the perfect complement -- cool jazz playing, charming bartender and sort of master of ceremonies Leftisiros (\"Lefty\") Homeric elixirs from the islands like Mashtiha and Omhpiko. The lovely owner Katia and her husband Constantina fall into the conversations. This in some other hands that could be a cold tourist place, living off the view alone. Just off the island of Patmos,…\n",

Reception and staff are very friendly they help you a lot with everything. They have the Point rooftop restaurant and bar which is amazing. You should try it one night.

We got a deal with BA flights and the value was excellent. The atmosphere and the view alone from the roof terrace is worth coming here for. The hotel is round the corner from the popular Plaka area of Athens and right near the Acropolis.  All the Greeks are very warm and friendly and work really hard.

The best of the hotel is for sure its terrace bar on the 5th floor which offers spectacular view to the Acropolis. There is also an outdoor jacuzzi on the 4th floor with great view as well, although I did not try it (a colleague did).  The room itself is ok, but rather small for what one could expect for such an hotel. The view from my room was to an inside \" patio\" of a few square meters, but at least it was very quiet. Breakfast was ok.  Overall a bit pricey for what I got, but I´m not familiar with Athens prices as it was my first time there...\n",

The roof-top terrace bar and restaurant offers a stunning view of the Parthenon floodlit by night, which is absolutely breathtaking. The food there is a little pretentious, and not very varied for vegetarians, but for the privilege of sitting there we were happy to go along with it. They offer a rather sweet 'bonne bouche' which is a very imaginative take on a traditional Greek item (no, I'm not telling), and a good wine list, which unusually in these days includes retsina.

When I booked the hotel directly via their website, I booked the \"romance package\" which was basically the same as the other packages except we were supposed to have a bottle of sparkling juice in the room (or something to that effect..). I also requested to have a driver pick us up from the airport. In the days leading up to our stay, I emailed the hotel to confirm and they had no idea that I needed a driver. This was worrisome, but eventually we got it sorted out just fine. Also it seems there was no \"romance package\", which was okay (we did have our small child with us) but I'm unsure why they offer different package choices…\n",

Centrally located in the old town (Plaka) with 5 mins of an uphill walk to the entrance to the Acropolis and basically across the street from the new Acropolis museum.   Also about 3 mins walk to the Acropolis Metro station.   Easy access to all eating places, although the hotel's restaurant is as good and no more expensive than most outside eating experience, not to mention an unbeatable view of the hill.  Rooms are a bit on a small side a la Paris but clean and comfortable.   We had a an AC'd room in the bank of the building facing local school yard.   A bit noisy during school hours if you prefer to keep the window open, but otherwise very, very quiet and private.   The staff is very helpful and really pleasant to deal with.   Overall, an…\n",

The hotel was very centrally located next to the Acropolis and the hotel staff was a great help in ensuring that we had directions and were able to get where we needed to go. Also, the rooftop restaurant had the best drinks! The bartender was awesome! The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars was because the rooms were very, very small and the bed was pretty uncomfortable. Other than that, it was good!\n",

The room smelled musky and is in need of an uplift. The bathroom is run down, with a light broken and the shower door leaks so water flooded the bathroom. Wifi only works in the lobby and not in the rooms, even though they claim it's available all around the hotel.   The only upside is its location close to the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum, but I would sacrifice that for a higher quality interior and staff with a better attitude.\n",

The area was safe with no issues seen. The rooms are a little small compared to the hotel website photos - but it is Europe and typical of the region. I was surprised that the hotel does not have irons in the room or a laundry to iron clothes - First time in a hotel I have ever come across this.  But if you are happy to pay others to iron your shirt this isn't an issue. Rooms and hotel are spotless and the roof top bar/staff were great.\n",

Unless you are looking for a pool, or some other amenity that you need (or don't need that you pay for), I think that for the price this is an excellent choice for Athens.  Take a right when you come out the door and in five minutes you are at the Acropolis, take a left and in two minutes you are at a hop on hop off stop, and five minutes you enter Plaka, which is the pedestrian only area with restaurants, tavernas,…\n",

We hadn't been there 15 minutes when the maid knocked on our door to ask how our room was. We told her about the smell. Since we were on our way out she said to leave the patio door open and she would come in and spray. When we returned, the smell was definitely better but still present.

They have this amazing open air hot tub where you can gaze up at the Acropolis.

Some other balconies were too small for furniture but sitting out there with a glass of wine in the evening was heaven!  Half board initially meant that we were given no menu and the waiter told us what we would eat.  After some negotiation we were given a slightly reduced choice from the excellent a la carte menu which made us much happier.

The tour buses stop nearby and the local restaurants are fabulous!  The wifi was good and the breakfast was filling and quite tasty!\n",

Staffs are very kind for any case. When we checked in again after three days, they remembered us and did not ask for passport again. Clever ^^ OK!

For the price, I am wondering if you could do better.  I traveled alone, so the twin size bed was fine, just surprised me.  I've never stayed in a hotel with a twin size bed.   The information from the front desk on the hours of the Parthenon was wrong.  I set my alarm for early so I could visit the Parthenon before my flight.  It was closed because it was a National Holiday.  It seems like the hotel desk staff could have known this. The hotel was noisy and VERY hot, which made it difficult to sleep.  Temperature can not be adjusted in your room, and it was much too noisy to have the sliding door open. I did get to have a glass of wine and baklava…\n",

It’s a downtown Athens hotel, so don’t expect a sweeping driveway and gardens. As said by others, the location is superb and very handy for the Metro (Acropoli station), but you can walk to all the centrally located must-see sites from here. Plenty of dining options nearby. My only issue – as with nearly all hotels – is noise from adjoining rooms; I am resigned to the fact that this is something I just need to put up. Think they have tried to fit additional insulation but light sleepers might want to carry earplugs. But this won’t put me off staying here when I next visit glorious Athens.\n",

Special praise goes to the breakfast lady (would that I had learned your name!!) who prepared a breakfast tray for my better half one morning, teased and praised my Greek, and spared me a smile for following days. She is now the face of the Herodion for me.  Oh, and did I mention the incredible views of the Acropolis from both our room's balcony and from the rooftop? This year, another advantage came from the closeness of the hotel to the car rentals on Syggrou. A pleasant bonus for our trips out of the city.\n",

The bus tour stops just 2 minutes from the hotel and we used it over two days.  Cocktails from the bar were nice and it has a lovely cosy bar area down stairs to relax it.

Construction work on 3rd floor - I noticed a sign at reception about this but nothing was mentioned by the check in staff so I assumed it wouldn't affect our stay.  When I arrived in my room there was drilling and banging which was very loud, even though I was 2 floors away from it.  we do not intend to stay in our hotel at all during the day but it started at least at 9am i.e. before we got up for breakfast which is very annoying. If this was mentioned on check in with say a free drink or something, we wouldn't have minded at all.  2. We booked a double room and arrived in our room to find 2 separate single beds.

No noise problem, and we were entertained by watching the children have a short assembly in the morning before entering school.

Sure enough the we got to see the fireworks from the hotel as promised. In fact, it was so cold on NYE (snowed during the day) that I was lucky to see the fireworks from the comfort of my own hotel room.   The room was big and comfortable. Only downside was that they joined two single beds to make a king for hubby and I, which wasn't so comfortable. Amenities don't include an iron, which I was surprised to discover for a 4* hotel.

It is adjacent to the Acropolis Museum, and it sits just below the Acropolis itself.  As you can probably judge from the various reviews, the terrace makes the hotel.  I spent a leisurely Sunday night watching the Parthenon and contemplating Western civilization with a drink in hand.  If I had one small knock, it would be the hot tub.  This is a nice a hotel, and I was pleasantly surprised when I learned they had a hot tub.  However, the tub was on a timer.  You used your room key to turn it on, and once your 10 minutes were up, the hot tub would not turn on again.  This may be a European thing, but it made for a less than pleasant experience.\n",

Some of the folks at the front desk were helpful, such as the young man who helped me to print boarding passes for a flight the next day, the gentleman who checked us out, and the gentleman who made sure we got some cookies and cakes prior to leaving for our flight.  Other folks at the front desk were more or less…\n",

The Acropolis museum is also a stone's throw away. Accessibility to other attractions is not an issue given the proximity to the metro station and public transport. The service is top notch and professionals l. The breakfast is very good as well. Would return to this place without any hesitation whatsoever\n",

From the roof top you can see the lit up Acropolis as well as the lit up Acropolis Museum across the street.  Very surreal seeing the ruins atop the hill with the actual artifacts glowing in the building next door.  You can also see this from the outdoor hot tub too!  The rooms were basic, free wifi, great breakfast spread, warm charming lobby with fireplace.  Perfect place to journal all your daily activities!  Finally, the staff was over the top with hospitality and helpfulness, especially Anthony.  When I come back I will make sure he is working those days, truly a warm, sincere informative person always with a smile to share.  Thanks Anthony for making our trip extra special!\n",

A great breakfast and fast broadband coupled with a roof top that enjoys stunning views in three historic directions including the Parthenon. In warmer weather the roof top becomes a restaurant and bar, with hot tubs and sun lounger areas. What more could one want? I will return for a more leisurely stay with my wife! Tim P(15.12.15)\n",

There are also great views of the Parthenon from the rooftop veranda.  The room was quite spacious, with a wooden floor and doorless wardrobe/shelves. There is a nice rooftop terrace with bar service in the summer months.  There is an excellent restaurant. Our stay in Athens coincided with the Marathon race, so the hotel provided special meals (e.g. high in carbohydrates) for those participating in the race. The \"normal\" meals were also excellent.\n",

The rooms are small and not really sound proof. Bathrooms are small and not really clean (hairs in the bath tube). Service was friendly. Stayed there end of October and they had already suspended the service on the rooftop bar.\n",

Since it was raining, we took a taxi to the Archaeological Museum (<10 Euros).  Breakfast was good with plenty of open seating.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Three computers and one printer are available for airline on-line reservations.  We had a nice dinner in their restaurant after a full day of sightseeing.  Candy, soft drinks, bottle water and fruits can be purchased from a number of small neighborhood stores located less than a block away.  We would definitely stay in this hotel again.\n",

The breakfast was good, although a bit chaotic when it was busy, but the crowning glory is the roof-top restaurant, with an uniterrupted view of the Acropolis just 100 metres or so away - floodlit - and wonderful - at night, and of the New Acropolis Museum just 65 metres away in the opposite direction.  Great food, a very accomplished cocktain barman, and overall a brilliant experience. Rooms were cosy - we had a triple, so the view wasn't…\n",

The room was clean and sufficiently large.  Although our room faced a busy street, it was surprisingly quiet at night. The jacuzzi faces the Acropolis and a nighttime view doesn't get any better than that.  We ate at the restaurant on the roof and were equally pleased.  The breakfast was among the best of our two-week trip.  This hotel is relatively expensive, but the services and comfort were worth it.  The location next to the Acropolis Hotel and the Dionysiou Areopagitou promenade is very convenient.\n",

The staff is friendly and attentive – I never saw a woman carry her luggage down the stairs to the street – staff insisted on providing that service.  Breakfasts offered incredible variety from eggs several ways to yogurt and cereal, bacon and sausages, many breads, many fruits – all you can eat and included in the cost of the room.  My only ding would be that the walls are a bit thin so TV sound from the adjacent room did carry into our room.  Only a problem after 11pm!

Its price was reasonable for what we experienced; rooms were not large but well appointed, clean, comfortable and quiet.

The top view is of course one good reason for staying here, besides being very central with walking distance to most interesting places. The friendly and helpful staff is another good reason for staying here. I got good advice for where to shop when my suitcase got lost at the airport, and they could also help me with finding a music shop.  Breakfast is OK, wifi is working well and the size of the room was sufficient.\n",

The desk staff were very helpful and stored our luggage while we walked around the corner to the Acropolis, then other wonderful sights.The room was nice with a kettle for tea and coffee and the bed was great. We used the rooftop jacuzzi after a big day walking around and then had a drink at the rooftop bar and then dinner up on the roof as well. The view of the Acropolis at night is really special and we had  really delicious dinner to round off a great day. We walked to the new Acropolis museum after a wonderful breakfast, which had two homemade Greek cakes to enjoy, then left for the airport.

The bathroom was a great size! The guy who brought our bags up was really helpful with explaining the features of the room and the hotel. Also the people at the reception were lovely. Breakfast was delicious! And it was nice to receive a friendly greeting each morning. The location is perfect for seeing the sights of Athens - all in walking distance. I'd recommend the rooftop restaurant - great prices, great food and amazing nighttime views of the Parthenon! I also enjoyed a nightcap up here in the bar each night! Great hotel would gladly stay here again.\n",

We had a drink/snack on the rooftop with perfect views - did not try out the  javuzzi's. Great dinner downstairs one evening and excellent buffet breakfast. And very helpful staff.

I would've really liked a view of the Parthenon on the hill.   Despite being so close to the two restaurants, I rarely heard any sound even during breakfast in the AM. The mini bar had good prices. I would've preferred a \"do not disturb\" sign for my door, however, as I got interrupted with a knock by housekeeping in the early evening. AC worked well.

The rooms were nice and clean, beds comfortable (though a bit smaller than NA standards). The only challenge with the room was the shower set up. The shower barrier only extended partway across which meant if you weren't careful, you would end up with a pretty damp bathroom post shower.   The breakfast was decent (eggs, croissants, feta, fruit, etc.). Loved the rooftop terrace with a view of the Parthenon.

Location was great as hotel was essentially in walking distance of all the major sites and neighborhoods and also easy access to the subway and main highways.

      "Review is :My girlfriend and I have stayed at the Herodion Hotel five times now. The hotel has a good central location just below Acropolis with walking distance to many of the must-see attractions in Athens (The Plaka, Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum - just to name a few). The rooms are clean and cosy and the free WIFI is fast and stable. The hotel also features a great roof top restaurant and bar with stunning views of the Acropolis (especially during the evening) and a very nice roof top sun deck and jacuzzi (free of charge). Having a cocktail while sitting in a jacuzzi gazing up on the Acropolis is near-Nirvana to me. You should definitely try this if you're staying at the hotel!\n",

Central location allows early access to sites before they get too busy, only about 400 m to the Acropolis museum and entrance to the Acropolis\n",

The cocktails were good, waitresses so nice, and the views around you just stunning.\n",

The food was very good and the staff were very good at understanding the requirements of a coeliac diner; it was alsi good value and the staff were really helpful. A perfect location to see all the sights and access Plaka and the flea market area. I would recommend this small, very friendly hotel to families, solo travellers or groups of friends.\n",

As is apparent from the map, the location is just about perfect; it's basically at the foot of the Acropolis, and the Acropolis Museum is just a few storefronts and a narrow street away.  An unexpected virtue was the hotel restaurant.  We booked dinner there for convenience, as this was our first day and we were tired from the overnight flight.  But we were impressed with the cuisine, and blown away by the view of the illuminated Parthenon looming over our table.\n",

Also, a few blocks to the busy Plakas where wonderful restaurants can be found.  Our room was very large in fact in could be a small suite. It was a perfect view of the Acropolis which is also lit up at night. The bed was comfortable and large.

We booked a superior room with the Acropolis view and highly recommend that choice--the view is absolutely stunning and well worth paying for. It was such a delight to wake up and see Athen's treasure, and when lit up at night it was breathtaking. We found our room comfortable. We were surprised at the size and realized that reviewers who complain about the rooms being small must be expecting American \"super-sizing\" of rooms. All of the amenities were as promised, and since we stayed here for a week, we took advantage of the rooftop restaurant and bar and the whirlpool tubs. We enjoyed it all.   The location of the Herodion is ideal. We were able to walk to most of the attractions we were interested in, and were…\n",

The rooftop bar has a spectacular view, the reception is prompt and always helpful and were always willing to answer questions. The only reason I cant give this hotel a higher rating is because the room we had was tiny and the bathroom looked tired. Whilst fairly clean, we treated it more as a place to check in for the evening - this suited our requirements fine. The in bathroom amenities were old and are in need of updating.

The Beauty of Acropollis and Parthenon. And if it is getting to hot, jump into the Yakuzi on the roof top. Sounds a bit like an extravaganza? Sure it is, but what a view.

One downside we experienced was that elevators were surprisingly small for a hotel of this size and had a long wait. Since our room was on the first floor, we typically walked up to one level to our room (wasn't a huge problem for us but if we were on a higher floor, probably would be more annoyed with elevator wait time).\n",

The biggest issue was the air conditioning. It was LOUD. The choice was a hot room and peace, or a cool room and noise. Caused interrupted sleep every night which is far from ideal.

The hotel was well positioned for all the main attractions such as the Acropolis - 10 min and the museum - 5 minutes. All the tourist streets where minutes from the hotel with gift shops, coffee shops and restaurants galore. The main shopping centre was walkable but we used the hop on bus to tour the city and get us there. The Athenians where very sociable and the food was good although I did find the price of wine slightly more expensive than I imagined.

A few blocks from the entrance to the acropolis, along with cool restaurants/bars (Barettos and Strofi were our favorites).  The room itself was nothing special but a good value for the price.  Rooms were on the small side and our \"view\" room didn't have much of a view, it was on the 3rd floor and looked out onto an abandoned tennis court.  But that wasn't critical since we didn't spend much time in the room.  Service at the front desk was great, wifi was pretty good, and the breakfast was good.

Reserve a table and have dinner (along with a free glass of wine) as you take in the Parthenon.   We ate at 10:00.  If you go much earlier, the spotlights won't be on the Acropolis. The grilled salmon in ginger was delicious. The location is perfect, right next to the Acropolis Museum, and only a block away from many sidewalk restaurants, serving less expensive meals for large families, and plenty of shops.\n",

It is not on a pedestrian street that makes the Plaka neighborhood so charming but is just around the corner. It is a quiet neighborhood still in the old quarter.

Don't miss cocktails and dinner on the hotel's 5th floor patio restaurant. Breakfast was also fabulous!!!

      "Review is :The neighborhood near the Acropolis is not elegant, but this hotel was beyond expectations.   The rooms are compact, and while the bathroom had no window or fan, it was spacious, with marble floor and great water pressure in the tub/shower.  We also, for 180 euros, had a nice balcony with table and chairs.  My in-laws announced that we would be eating at the hotel restaurant, Point.  Uggh, I thought - hotel food!  What a surprise!  Roof top deck looking up to the Acropolis - OK at least a view.  The food was excellent - I had pork, that was actually perfectly prepared pork belly (14 euros, I think) and my daughter said the homemade pasta was \"the best she had ever had\".   We went to a highly recommended \"gourmet\" restaurant the next evening - and it was  not as good and much…\n",

      "Review is :The Herodion hotel is set smack dab in a tourist district which is good and bad. Good- you can walk to most of the points of interest in Athens easily.  Bad- the vendors and especially restaurants are quite aggressive in their attempts to get you inside. It gets quite wearing after 15 or 30 minutes, especially when you just want to go for a nice after dinner stroll under the silhouette of the Parthenon.  The hotel is a bit dark inside, despite all the windows in the lobby. We had room 210 which had a view of the Parthenon (photo attached). The room was very clean and despite being in a busy area was really quiet inside. We were able to open the balcony door in the morning and look at the Parthenon above. The only sound other were the birds singing. No scooters, busses, horns or…\n",

      "Review is :This is a delightful, small hotel conveniently located to the historic district of Athens, including the Acropolis (which our room overlooked, and which can also be viewed from the lovely rooftop terrace where drinks and dinners are served nightly!).  The front desk receptionists are friendly, speak fluent English and are extremely accommodating.  Rooms are clean and modern.  A full breakfast buffet is included in the daily rate and is first rate, offering a wide range of items including homemade breads and pastries.  We ate dinner one night on the rooftop terrace.  Food was excellent, and it was complemented by a breathtaking view of the Acropolis, lit up at dusk.  We HIGHLY recommend this hotel for people staying in Athens for a few days of sightseeing.\n",

      "Review is :I was a bit surprised when we arrived at the Herodion - it was much smaller than i imagined it would be. the location could not be better - a nice quiet street and as close to the Acropolis and Parthenon Museum as you could get. Our room was OK - I expected better, so maybe it was my expectations that were the problem. I was certainly glad that we did not have to stay in the room they originally gave us looking into a air well. I think we would have moved to another hotel as it looked very depressing. So thank you for moving us to a room with a little balcony over the street which was fine and nice and airy. Bathroom was very small indeed. The foyer was really lovely and the breakfast was also good. Rooftop restaurant with view of the Parthenon is a must-do.\n",

We did not eat dinner, but the included breakfast was wonderful. A variety of pastries, meats, eggs, cereal, fruits...fresh juice, much more than typical euro spreads!   We did order a slice of chocolate cake our first afternoon...served warm, absolutely heavenly!  If it fits your budget, request a view of Acropolis, upper floor. Take advantage of the chic rooftop bar, great views.\n",

Breakfast was good, amazing yogurt, small option of fruits but a lot of bread and pastries. I was very disappointed at the first night because the mattress is REALLY thin and i could´t sleep and had a back pain. Besides that the room was just above the hotel´s automatic door so at 7 am i just stopped trying to sleep at all - the noise from it was very loud. The lady from reception was very kind and moved us to a better room on the second floor and put a second mattress above the other one, so i slept just fine on the other days.

They work hard but often run in circles. We had standard room on a low floor, just above the street.  But we met a man in the elevator who had a top floor room with an Acropolis view who told us his view was that the hotel was a 2 star, with a 4 star location.  We think 5 star location, but agree on hotel comment.  The bed is a thin mattress, rather like sleeping on your grandmothers lumpy couch on ill fitting sheets.   The windows are well insulated but if you want to open for fresh air the noise and fumes can be overwhelming.

When we arrived at the hotel, we realized we'd left a pair of sunglasses in the rental car we'd just returned. The hotel called on our behalf and arranged for them to be delivered. They brought the sunglasses straight to us while we were having dinner at their rooftop restaurant. The food there was fantastic. The nighttime view of the Acropolis and the Acropolis museum is stunning. The servers were really fabulous. The rooms and modern and very comfortable. The hotel arranged a very early cab for us to the port to catch our ferry. We would definitely return to the Herodion.\n",

      "Review is :The hotel arranged our transfers without hassle. We arrived just before1am but the service was still impeccable. The night porter took our luggage to the room which was lovely with a big bed and a balcony. The decor everywhere was quite new and imaginative, the bedroom wall were covered with a foam backed material which stopped any noise from the adjoining rooms. Everthing worked as it should. Breakfast was either an egg and bacon affair or home made cakes or ham and cheese, plenty of fruit and bread - excellent! The public area was nicely tiled with a bar and a conservatory restaurant behind that.  Lunch was as good as the breakfast in it's way and not expensive. No doubt about the highlight though - the roof top restaurant with the most wonderful views of the Acropolis.   If…\n",

The Herodion is a very clean, modern, cost-effective choice for those who want to stay within walking distance of the Acropolis and the recently opened Acropolis Museum.  Everything is reachable with a very short walk-this is a convenient hotel!  The lobby has a retro ‘70s look which is very “in” at this moment. Our superior double room (which I recommend) looked out to the Acropolis, from the 3rd floor.  One ought to be aware that a private school with playground backs up to the Herodion and during the day, young children play in the fenced in yard.

Located right across the street (literally) from the new Acropolis Museum, it is also within an easy walk of the Akropolis, the Agora, and the Kerameikos cemetery. There are any number of cheap restaurants on the street called Makrigianni and more up-scale ones where that street joins the one called Vyronos at the monument of Lysikrates. Makrigianni is also the location of the Metro stop, Akropolis, which is a short hop to Syntagma where one can get off and walk to both the Benaki and Goulandris Museums.

There's a great rooftop restaurant with a close-up view from the Acropolis. The family room is right sized and clean. The only opportunity would be the pillows which are quite high and hard.

      "Review is :We stayed here for three nights on a recent city break to Athens.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, if only for its location. It is at the foot of the Acropolis and the entrance is about a five minute walk away.   Other things which makes this a great location for a hotel are:  1) The metro (Acropoli) is a five minute walk away (with suitcases) 2) The City Site Seeing bus stop is 1 minute walk away (a must to see the city) 3) The Plaka area is a five minute walk away which has an abundance of souvenir type shops as well as plenty of lovely family run restaurants with lovely food. 4) The National Gardens, Parliament and Herodian's Gate/Temply of Olympus is about a 15 min walk away.  So it really is very central, whilst being in a nice quiet area of the city.  The hotel…\n",

The Herodion is right next to the Acropolis Museum (don't miss that) and a five minute walk up the street to the entrance to the Acropolis itself.  We arrived around 9 PM and were quickly checked in.  The room is of average size for a city hotel and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of good pillows of various sizes.  We were on the second floor facing the street and there was virtually no street noise with the sliding door closed.  The included breakfast was just average.  A few more hot items would have been nice.  The eggs were unappetizing and precooked.  The staff is very helpful and the rooms were cleaned to a high standard quickly while we were at breakfast.

We had teenagers with us and felt very comfortable allowing them to explore around the area on their own.  I can't say enough about the staff at the hotel who were genuinely to make our stay the best it could be. They got us in for an early check in and prepared a small breakfast for us even though they were done with breakfast and cleaning up. The staff at the desk guided us on how to make our way around the city, and helped us rent a car for our next leg of our journey  The rooftop area is absolutely lovely. We definitely recommend a stay at the Herodion!!\n",

Two flights up further in the new rooftop garden and you can look up at the Acropolis as though it belongs to you.  The hotel is just around the corner from the entrance to the New Acropolis Museum and within just two blocks of the Odeon of Herod and the way up to the Acropolis itself.

At the foot of the Acropolis and next to the Acropolis Museum, this may prove to be a perfect base in Athens.  The hotel is very well refurbished. Attention was greatly paid to details. The interior is well thought of and quite chic yet enough to pull into the atmosphere of yesteryears.  The rooms were clean, beds and linens comfortable. We chose the rooms with the Acropolis view because when one is in Athens then why not? The bar is charming and the service at the reception is beyond par.  One of the best feature is the jacuzzi on the rooftop facing the Acropolis.\n",

When you avoid the hotel kitchen for dinner you will have a splendid stay in a sufficient sized room with an adequate bathroom.

      "Review is :Stayed in a family room with friends for a few nights to see Athens. EXCELLENT location, easy walking distance to some very good restaurants and sightseeing. Staff were all helpful and polite, good selection of drinks at the bar, and pretty view from the rooftop. Wasn't aware of the roof jacuzzi but that looked really nice too! Only thing I could say is that the walls must be paper thin, could hear our neighbours in the middle of the night coughing, and even a guy say \"do you need some water\" and the girl replied \"no\" and continued coughing. This didn't keep me awake, and I do wonder if non family rooms may be better insulated. Breakfast was included and was fairly standard, as was Wifi throughout. Would stay here again if I return!\n",

From the moment we arrived outside and a member of staff carried our bags up the stairs, to checking in where we were given lots of useful information about the hotel and surrounding area, the female member of staff also recommended we visit the Acropolis museum that night as it is open late on a Friday (Great recommendation!) Every single member of staff we came across at the hotel was very helpful and friendly and they are happy to answer any questions. We had room 316 which had an Acropolis view, I definitely recommend paying the extra, the view is breathtaking, we had a small balcony which was nice to relax on after a long day. The breakfast was lovely, most days we didn't need…\n",

We couldn't have chosen a better hotel, in all of Athens :) Firstly, the hotel is located centrally - just 10 mins away from the Acropolis, with is visible through higher floor rooms, and just 5 mins away from the nearest metro station. Secondly, the staff were very helpful. Thirdly, the food was fresh and very Greek - especially the Bougatsa. YUMMM!   Thank you for making our stay a truly memorable one, you guys :)\n",

The room itself was twice as more as another we stayed at and was not as big.  The bar bar on the roof really wasn't on the roof.  It is downstairs and someone will bring you drinks.  However, it is not as convenient as some.       The location however is fantastic!  Right next door to the New Acropolis Museum, around the corner from the subway station and a strip of restaurants that are great.  Arcadia was our favorite!  Staff was friendly and rooms and hotel were clean.  Just a little pricey for what you get.  All in all though, I would stay there again if I was unable to book a certain other hotel.\n",

We were given a room on the first floor with no view, which looked in to the interior courtyard. The room was arguably the smallest I have ever stayed in and there was barely room to walk round. The power also went out in the room twice during our stay. The walls in the rooms on the first floor are also incredibly thin and you can hear conversations in the corridor and other rooms as if they were in your room.  We booked through British Airways (not sure if this lead to no upgrades/ very small room). Staff were all very friendly and the breakfast was very good, location is very convenient for all the sites.

A room with a view of the Acropolis (at extra charge) was icing on the cake. The staff are very friendly, the breakfast solid & sumptuous. A sizable Spar supermarket is a 5-minute walk away.  There are two things worth noting though. First, the walls between rooms are far from soundproof. You can make out the language they're speaking next door at average volumes. Second, if the management put a reserve on a certain amount of money on your card at the beginning of your stay (\"blocking\" it), then be aware that release of funds may take up to 14 days (in my case, UK bank).

Also the shower hose didn't work very well and all the water just spilt everywhere making the floor a bath of water which made it a safety hazard.

It's handy for the Acropolis but not much else - if I was returning to Athens I would book something more central.   The hotel is generally clean and functional, apart from the shower that floods the bathroom (as mentioned by a previous reviewer).  The (free) wi-fi was very unreliable, but that's a minor niggle in the context of the above.\n",

For instance, the hotel boasts about its hotel restaurant/bar on the rooftop; however, they fail to mention that the rooftop bar closes down at some point during the autumn months since it was non-functional during our stay. The rooms are very tiny, but clean.  The shower only had a flimsy 12 inch piece of plastic acting as a shower door, thus a pool of water would accumulate on the bathroom floor after each use. My major complaint about this hotel was the cleaning staff. I'm not sure if there was some sort of towel shortage in Athens, but the cleaning crew would RARELY leave fresh towels. The first day, they took towels that we purposely left hanging on the rack to…\n",

There was lots of peach and pink in the bedroom, no pictures - and some fierce lighting in the bathroom that threatened to strip my retinas. The room was fiercely hot, which made it difficult to sleep.   Looking at the other reviews, I can only assume that the lower down in the hotel you are the worse the rooms become.  Okay, there are some upsides: the location is very good. There is free wifi. There is a hot tub on the roof.  I'll be honest and say that I probably would not return to this hotel.\n",

The hotel is perfect for the Acropolis and its giant museum, and it was only a 10-minute walk to the atmospheric alleys and streets of Plaka. In fact, we never needed taxis or the metro whether in Plaka or visiting the funky bars of Psirri.  So what didn't appeal about the hotel? Mainly our room. On the ground floor, it was really tired.

      "Review is :This hotel is very convenient to the best spots in Athens.  It has a nice lobby, and great rooftop bar and restaurant.  But the rooms!!!! While they are clean and modern they are like dungeons.  At least the one we had.  The only window was a sliding glass door that led to our balcony.  The balcony was maybe 3 feet by 5 feet - smaller than the bathroom.  It had walls on 5 sides and it shared a wall with the stairway.  Someone could swing from the stairway to our balcony with no problem.  Needless to say we kept the door closed and the curtain closed.  If the room rate was 2/3 of what we paid I would say great value.  But for the price I was very disappointed in the quality of the room.\n",

Main floor restaurant is excellent, very good service. The breakfast ( included ) is average at best. We dined twice on the roof top with good service but luke warm entrees at best. I have a feeling the food is being  brought up from the kitchen on the main floor, not a good situation. The roof top whirlpools are excellent, relaxing and a lovely view of the Acropolis. Book a higher quality room to avoid being placed in a small room facing a interior well.\n",

The rooms are smallish but comfortable. And the personnel are kind and helpful. The breakfast, which is included in the price of the room, is diverse and plentiful. Finally, I agree with the opinions of most of the reviewers: the terrace, specially at nit, is delightful, with an incredible view of the Parthenon. We enjoyed the 3 days we spent there, and heartily recommend it to anyone that visits Athens.\n",

The friendliness of the reception desk staff varied but on the whole it was good.  We arrived to the hotel around 13.45 and were told that we could have our room until 14.00, which was not a good start.  The room itself was rather small but it was perfectly OK for our two-night stay.  It seemed to be very quiet room and we did not hear any noise from neighbouring guests.  Breakfast was OK and met expectations for a 3-4 star hotel.  The cafe/restaurant in the foyer had chess and backgammon sets for guests to use.  The rooftop bar/restaurant had lovely views across the city and of course the Parthenon.  Unfortunately the drink service on the rooftop bar was painfully…\n",

Herodion has great views of the Acropolis, by day and especially by night from the roof top garden bar. Its location is within a good walking distance to most of the ancient ruins, also restaurants and shops close by. Breakfast at Herodion was nice with a variety. Rooms clean and reasonable size for three. I only have one concern and that is with the very small elevator. This would not be sufficient in an emergency evacuation. Otherwise a good hotel with Great location.\n",

Make reservations ahead of time.  If you so choose the atrium is also a wonderful setting for lunch or an evening meal.  You can't go wrong with either the hotel or its eateries.  Enjoy!

Rooms are ok. Not bad and not top. It depends a bit on which room you get. The only thing that really stands out are the roof top terraces, the one with the Jacuzzi's, and the one with the restaurant. In fact, eating an evening on top with a splendid view on the acropolis really made the difference.\n",

Big letdown was with the room.  It is very small, no chair - just a stool under a small desk.  The walls are very thin and I could hear conversations and TV from several different rooms.  Street noise was very loud unless the window was fully closed.  Our room had a tiny balcony but only one chair. Not really useful if more than one person is staying so we brought the chair into the room.  It felt more like a dorm than a hotel.  I've traveled throughout Europe and don't expect U.S. size rooms, but this was smaller than most, and more expensive. I'm not sure if the room is air conditioned or not.  The guy who showed…\n",

      "Review is :This hotel has many plus points - its location, décor, furnishings, staff and quality of breakfast cannot be faulted.  However, it is unacceptable for a hotel in this price bracket, in a city which gets as hot and humid as Athens does, to have poor air-conditioning. Despite it being jumper and jacket wearing weather outside,  our room (which overlooked an inner courtyard) was airless and stiflingly hot.   The air conditioning unit did little other than make a lot of noise.   To be fair, we should have asked to change our room, but in my opinion, this kind of basic issue should not be experienced in a hotel charging four-star prices.  We would certainly not want to be staying at the Herodion in the summer months.\n",

The rooftop bar was just lovely after a day out and great to relax and look across to the city and the floodlit Parthenon. The staff were really attentive and helpful the breakfast was excellent - apart from the coffee which was the only criticism I could find with the hotel overall.

I found the room small and faded looking which was disappointing in contrast to everything else about the hotel.

      "Review is :We have spent a long weekend in Athens back in November 2013 and stayed at Herodion Hotel as a group of 4 friends. Located on a quiet street right behind the Acropolis Museum (not to be confused with the Acropolis site), the hotels has a wonderful location. The metro station and the popular Plaka district is also a short walk away. The rooftop terrace has a view of the Acropolis however we could not enjoy it since it was a bit chilly back in November. The lobby lounge is nice and quiet with the adjacent bar to enjoy drinks and relax.\n",

From the view of the Parthenon from our room to the 5 minute walk to the Acropolis (and basically next door to the Acropolis museum) this could not have been more convenient. Even better it was clean, stylish, and our room was wonderful (great size, with a small balcony with Acropolis view). The rooftop bar was awesome and a great way to spend sunset in Athens. The staff were extremely helpful. Overall very pleased with this hotel!\n",

The breakfast was decent, lots of bread options. A must-do is to have dinner upstairs in the rooftop restaurant, aside from its brilliant view, the food and service is excellent at a very reasonable price.

Unfortunately because of illness only one room was needed when we arrived.  I did not expect any refund (I had the option to book refundable but chose not to).  On checking in I explained that we only needed one room and the person at the desk went away to discuss with the manager.  The outcome - we were offered a €250 credit for hotel services for our stay.  This was incredibly generous and completely unexpected.  It allowed us to drink at the bar and eat at the rooftop restaurant for our whole stay without incurring any extra charges!    Food in the rooftop restaurant was good, though I'd recommend taking a pullover/fleece in the evenings. …\n",

It definitely has a lot of people moving in/out non-stop but service at the front desk as well as the morning breakfast area was always up to par. The rooms are small, but reasonable. The bed was good quality. We technically had a view of the Acropolis, but really a corner angle to not get too excited about.

We found the Herodion Hotel and I have to say what seemed at first as \"stuck in Greece\" quickly became \"fall in love with Athens\" part 2!  The family owned/run hotel provides a boutique feel the second you walk in its doors. The lobby has several local Greek artists work on display and a greenhouse open face restaurant. The rooms aren't large, but seem to fit the average standard room size in Athens, with one unique exception, the neighborhood is beautiful!!!

Granted the location for this hotel is excellent, near the Acropolis, the New Acropolis Museum, the old town area, shopping etc..  Our room was basically large enough to fit the double size bed with a few feet to spare on either side.  The closet was ridiculous; if you wore only shirts or mini skirts you would be all set; forget hanging any trousers or dresses.  The breakfast buffet (included) was excellent and they will make lattes and smoothies for you just for the asking.  We ate at the Point Restaurant on the roof the first night; the food was OK but the view of the lit Acropolis was priceless.  OK for a short stay is my recommendation or get a suite!\n",

But from the off the Greek hospitality remained, with pleasant staff at reception (even though we had a little wait for our room to be ready).  The room itself was a decent size, and clean and tidy. The bonus being it had the highest positioned shower of the trip (being 6'3\" I've crouched under some tiny showers...). The balcony, conversely, is a small affair, with just one chair beside a small table, overlooking the street to the front of the hotel (facing the other way on the higher levels (we were only on level 2) would garner a view of the Acropolis.

We tried to eat at the much publicized roof restaurant, which has a nice view of the Acropolis, and were told it was closed due to weather.  This sounds pretty surprising because all the open air restaurants were serving, so we believe there was some other reason.  Views from other places are not especially scenic  The breakfast which is include in the room price was very nice, good food and variety and plenty of it.   There are a number of restaurants a couple of blocks away and a subway stop also a couple of blocks.  Staff generally very helpful\n",

I traveled with family, and they had a room with 3 beds, that was well spaced and designed.  The common areas, both lobby and the rooftop restaurant/bar, were sleek and inviting (don't miss the view of the Parthenon from the roof!), and the service was polished and efficient.  The breakfast was good, and the hotel is steps from the Acropolis Museum and no more than 15 minutes walk from the entrance to the Acropolis.  I didn't have a chance, but my family was also able to catch the hop-on, hop-off bus right near the hotel too.  Highly recommended.\n",

But I am stuck here. They gave me a cubicle without windows and I had to pay 131 euros a night for that cubicle. The breakfast is a shame on Greek standards. During my first night someone barged into my room even though the door was locked. Said sorry and left. But if you are a tourist, and if you do not care about the breakfast, and if you have a better room than mine, and if nobody barges into your room in the middle of the night, then you may enjoy your stay and give 5 stars...\n",

The location is fantastic - next to Acropolis museum and walking distance to The Acropolis and Plaka district.  What makes this hotel shine is it's rooftop restaurant and bar. The views are sensational, the bar and whole decor of the terrace is quite surprisingly, very cool and trendy. We dined in the rooftop restaurant and found the staff excellent and the food delicious and authentic. The breakfast room is very nice and the selection is great. We had a standard room, which is typical hotel size, cleaned well every day and good air conditioning. We hardly spent any time in our room in our three days, so the room being on the small side, didn't bother us. Why would you sit in your room when you could have…\n",

Excellent view from the rooftop and the dinner at the restaurant was very good. Breakfast was good and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  However, the front desk staff were not very welcoming or friendly and apparently only certain guests enjoy the privilege of having their luggage taken to their rooms.  Had to lug them up to our room while other, more well heeled, guests were catered too.  This is, of course, very annoying, but something one encounters all around Athens and Greece in general.

Also as it was very conveniently locate to The Plaka, which is the shopping, tourist restaurant and bar stroll, we only had to take a cab once the whole time we were in Athens.

The lovely owner gave us a tour at the rooftop, not in use at the time, but told us she planned to create a bar-restaurant up there. And Point A was born! Bar sees the Museum mostly, but the restaurant has a very close view to Acropolis.

Walking distance to Acropolis and museum. 1/2 block to Hop on hop off bus tour, nice restautants/Platka area.  Beautiful view from rooftop restaurant/bar. Nice room with balcony. Staff was wonderful and very helpful. Breakfast was very good with a little bit of everything. Downside, comfortable bed, but pillows were too hard and hardly any sound on TV. We would definitely pick this hotel again. Highly recommend it!\n",

      "Review is :I stayed here 2 days on my arrival to Athens, and then again on the last day.  It is located right next to the Acropolois Museum and a very short walk to the Plaka, Monastraki, Acropolis.  The first 2 nights I paid extra for balcony/acropolis view.  I was promised a view, but not the balcony.  I received both.  On the last day, I did not request either, but surprisingly got both again!  Although they advertise free wifi, it was sketchy at best.  The first 2 nights I was not able to get wifi service anywhere in the hotel.  But, on the last day, I was.  The wifi is not password protected, so I wonder if that has anything to do with it or not.  I loved the rooftop bar with view of the Parthenon!  There is also a cute rooftop area where you can lay out in the sun, although there is…\n",

They seem to have had somebody's kid setup the Wi-Fi which was a comedy of errors- to the point of tears at times.

I greatly advise this over the triple.  2 rooms = 2 ac units and for us that was a BIG bonus. The lobby is beautiful and I loved the atrium around bar. Tons of overstuffed couches, great chairs and private/cozy reading nooks. The architect understood how to fit a lot into a small space.

      "Review is :My husband stayed at the Herodian in July and pre-booked a Parthenon facing room (#319).  While the room wasn't huge, it was clean with laminate floors, a decent sized bathroom (with a tub/shower) and excellent water pressure.  Our room had a balcony big enough for a small table and 2 chairs.  The room next to us (#320) only had a Juliet balcony.  We backed onto a high school basketball court and since school was out for the summer, it was so quiet at night.  The Parthenon was beyond the school - beautiful.  The breakfast was very good, all the food was excellent especially the loukoumades.  Since the weather was lovely we didn't spend much time in the lobby, but there were lots of places to lounge and sit.  I would imagine it's quite cozy in the winter.  The best part of this…\n",

There is also a dearth of clean, comfortable, cozy, safe, centrally-located, handsome and affordable mid-class lodgings in central Athens--especially a single place fulfilling all these criteria at once. But look no further--just go to www.herodion.gr/‎ and book a room at the Hotel Herodion and you can cross 'hotel search' off of your to-do list.

I also picked the most expensive room from the several offerings for this hotel on Expedia, to try to get a really nice room (over 140 Euros by the way).  Unfortunately, when we got there, we were first given a room on the first floor facing the street, and thus very noisy. After complaining we were switched to another 1st floor room facing a back wall, no view but less noisy. Apparently all the rooms on the top floor were taken.  Worse, when we tried to go to the terrace, we found out it was closed due to a private event. Nice, real nice: the hotel makes extra money from the event, but we don't get what we paid for.

I had the great pleasure of having a meal at their restaurant at the roof terrace. The food was absolutely fabulous and very well priced. The view from the roof terrace is mind blowing and is something that you have to see with your own eyes. Dining while the sun sets and watching the Acropolis lighted up just a few meters away is an experience you will never forget.

The shower was nice size comparatively also. The view from the hot tub was amazing! And breakfast was a nice assortment,  hot and cold. I was especially happy that they served loukamades (sp?) the little greek donuts! And the location was awesome.  Just around the corner from the acropolis museum and Plaka, the main shopping square.

I contacted the hotel in advance to seek prices to upgrade to a Parthenon view room as it was my husbands birthday.

We also stayed at the King George (one of the best luxury hotels in Athens) and while I loved the luxe, admittedly if you are their to tour Athens, the Herodion might be a better bet as it is closer to everything (literally it's a short walk to all the major sights).  Also, the roof top bar and jacuzzi were perfect after a long day of walking.  I would recommend this hotel over and over!\n",

Second, our air conditioning was acting funny. One room was very cool, while the other was very warm. When we called the front desk, they sent a man to fix it.

      "Review is :Not far from the new Acropolis Museum, is the Herodion Hotel with the kind of comfort that Americans appreciate with soft pillows and a real bathtub to soak in after a long day on the tourist trail. Modern in concept, they have rooftop hot tubs and lounge, but upon our visit seemed under utilized. Their breakfast room offered fresh orange juice, array of breads and rolls, and brew by cup coffee maker. Advanced booking for Acropolis view rooms with balcony maybe necessary, but worth it!\n",

      "Review is :The Herodion is a wonderful hotel with a great location. Its location is just two blocks from the Parthenon Museum but in a more residential, quieter neighborhood than touristy Plaka. Easy walking distance to many things. The breakfast is wonderful as well - enough to keep you going until an early dinner! Also be sure to check out the wonderful rooftop restaurant, where you can see the Acropolis above you and directly into the Acropolis museum as well. The rooms are sparse but comfortable and let's be honest - with all the wonders of Athens, you won't be spending any time there anyway. The hotel staff were polite and helpful with free maps and advice for tourism.\n",

Actually, we didn't really need the view since we ate at the rooftop restaurant (highly recommended!).  I contacted the hotel for a pick-up at the airport for 4 people (45 euros), since we had a tight connection to a guided tour, and we made it easily.  Our rooms were not ready at 10:30, so the hotel stored our bags and we had a smooth check-in later that afternoon.  Contact with the hotel staff beforehand was very helpful and prompt.  All around service at the hotel was excellent.  They also gave us tickets to the Acropolis Museum for free - a nice bonus!

The rooms are renovated and simply decorated but they are very clean!!!!! Only the bath is old and very small. The staff is very kind and helpful!! The restaurant in the ground floor is very beautiful and warm decorated!!!! The breakfast is very good but not equal to a 4 stars hotel. It’s a little expensive hotel but it’s in a very quiet and great location!!! I stayed 3 days in May 2014 and I recommend it!!\n",

The Acropolis museum is a block away and we discovered that the entrance to the Acropolis itself that's closest to the museum is less crowded without a line to get in (at least in the end of May!). The tour buses all use the main entrance. As mentioned, their roof top bar and Acropolis view is stunning.

At reception Kostas, Lucas, Giorgios and Christos were all very helpful and friendly. We stayed several days in four different periods of time during our Christmas holidays. We took two rooms and since at the end we became like family they kept upgrading our rooms. The rooms with a view to the Acropolis are incredible, but even if you get the cheaper room without the view, you will hace access to the terrace where you can spend hours reading with that astonishing view. Everything else was correct: Clean, comfortable, reasonable wifi.\n",

Just one reserve regarding the noise which can be easily hear from the coridor or the rooms next to our room: early wake-up ! otherwise this is the perfect hotel!

They readily offered us advice on restaurants, tours, sites, places for Greek music.  They offer a very full buffet breakfast (included in our price) with lots of choices.  Their patio restaurant serves delicious local Greek dishes as well as other fare and the prices are quite reasonable.

The bathroom is clean and adequate towels and soaps are provided, however unless you are some kind of skilled shower-taker, it's hard not to get water all over the floor, as the glass door really only swings to close the tub area halfway. The synthetic parquet floor looks lovely and feels cleaner than carpet, and the housekeeping staff seem to clean it daily, but it could use a small rug on each side of the bed for added warmth and comfort.

It's also right around the corner from the marvelous Acropolis museum.  Be sure to drop over and check museum opening times for yourself.  The front desk wasn't up to date on evening hours, so we missed those -- often the best time to visit popular sites.  I would definitely stay here again.\n",

The hot tub is outside, off the 4th floor and has a spectacular view of the Acropolis but it was cold and cost 5 Euros to use for 15 minutes.  Free Wi-fi is only available in the lobby.  Warning: At least the 4th floor is a smoking floor, and if you are not a smoker it smells like a wet ashtray.  We did not specify non-smoking room, so our fault, but you need to specify if that bothers you.  Breakfast was adequate, but not fancy. Staff was helpful and friendly.  Good, free access to laptops in the lobby with a free printer.\n",

The room wasn't huge but it was clean and well appointed and had a terrace to sit out on. The breakfast had a large choice but we didn't eat any evening meals there as there was so much choice around the city. We walked virtually everywhere only using the underground a couple of times. The lounge, dining area and outside spaces were excellent and the staff very helpful and pleasant. Would recommend this hotel.\n",

We had excellent recommendations for wine to try and the olive oil they give you at the start of the meal is delicious!

It is also in a fabulous area of Athens with amazing views of the Acropolis. I did email the hotel before I arrived telling them it was our honeymoon and requested a room on the top floor which was unfortunately ignored and we found ourselves in a tiny cramped room on the 3rd floor. Even so the view was amazing but we were disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. The carpet was old and frayed and very dirty. It looked like a hoover had not been anywhere near it for many years! I also did not like the fact that the cleaner just walked into our room twice without even knocking. This is unacceptable!

The hotel front desk staff far outclassed the facility itself as far as I was concerned. They were polite, very friendly, and accommodating. When I checked in, my room wasn't ready so I went to the roof top to experience the views there. One of the gentlemen from the front desk located me on the roof top to let me know when my room was ready and apologized for the inconvenience. I thought this was very thoughtful and kind of took me by surprise.  Once I got squared away in my single room, I couldn't help but notice an odd odor that smelled like sewage gas coming from the bathroom. I ignored it for a while but through the first night it…\n",

I was then surprised to learn this hotel had smoking floors-wow is this the 80s still. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful but were unusable by me as an asthmatic as they constantly stank of smoke. Our room was clean, with plenty of storage space, but the beds were the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on(this was our 12th hotel on our 11month world trip).

The food and drink are really excellent, the coffee being the finest I have tasted in any hotel from around the world. and there have been a lot of them. Finally, I would like to add my thanks to the management and staff at this excellent hotel. for making our stay in Athens a stay to remember.\n",

The location is very convenient from the airport, being close to the Akropoli metro station, and at the same time spectacular. We had a view of the illuminated Parthenon from our comfortable room. Breakfast was good as well.\n",

We all stayed at the Herodion and we never heard a complaint from anyone.  They supplied a full and delicious breakfast each morning.  The room was a bit small, but comfortable as was the bathroom.  We did not have an \"American\" style shower, but a bath tub with a hand held shower.  It took getting used to, but a minor inconvenience.  The hotel staff spoke English and were able to answer questions.   The hotel is in walking distance to The Acropolis, The Plaka, Mars Hill, The Argora, The New Acropolis Museum, The Archaeological Museum, and many other Athen's sites.  I would recommend staying here.\n",

When we arrived we were impressed with the hotel lobby, bar and restaurant.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble at all.  When shown our room we were somewhat disappointed and were immediately shown two other room.  We chose to upgrade to a room with a view of the Parthenon.   It's important to understand the rooms in this hotel are not fancy.  They are basic and clean.  The view is outstanding but we only use our hotels for sleeping.  It was quite special to go to sleep looking out at the Parthenon and then to wake up each morning with the morning light on the Parthenon. The Acropolis Museum is…\n",

Absolutely fantastic location at the foot of the Acropolis and just 5-10 minutes walk from Plaka, Zeus's Temple, and the Acropolis itself. The hotel itself was clean with an excellent bar with a log fire, a jacuzzi on the roof and a rooftop view that would have been hard to leave in the summer. Service was excellent throughout, the buffet breakfast very good (although a larger jug for the fresh orange juice would have been nice!).  The only slight downside was that the room, whilst clean and comfortable, was slightly dated and we had two single beds pushed together rather than a double.

Downside is that the rooms and beds are outdated, unattractive, with average comfort. Having said that, I would still recommend this hotel unless you plan on staying in your room. Way too many wonderful things to do all within walking distance. So if you get a price under $90/night, I would go for it. If not, look elsewhere for something rated higher in room comfort.\n",

We took the metro into central Athens and then a taxi (they will rip you off, be wary!) and were greeted at the door of Herodian Hotel. The location of the hotel is fantastic, next door to the new Acropolis Museum and near many delicious restuarants!  We had booked a double room which was very clean and one of the hotel staff told us all the necessary details of the room and breakfast details etc. Incredibly comfortable beds and a pretty-good pressure shower. We flew out to Santorini early the next morning and wished we could have stayed for longer, thank you Herodian Hotel for a great stay!\n",

The bath was 120cm long which most people would struggle to sit in let alone lay down. While showering the bath is so small most of the water leaks onto the floor.   There is not even an iron in the room. Instead you have to pay for the hotel laundry service.  The door to the room was so stiff to open and close it had to be slammed as hard as possible for it to shut. While asleep around 9am I was surprised to be woken by the chamber maid knocking and opening the door.  We had one meal at the restaurant which was extremely poor. The lamb  chops we ordered were so overcooked they were actually burnt.…\n",

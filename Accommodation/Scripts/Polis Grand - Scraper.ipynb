      "Review is :I highly recommend Polis Grand Hotel for anyone who needs a clean, comfortable and friendly place to use as HQ for an Athens visit.   First, the staff is outstanding.  Our flight was due to arrive at 1:00 am and when I called to confirm the late arrival they were right on top of it.  We had a tour pickup before the breakfast buffet opened one day.  The staff had already spotted this and arranged for a take-away breakfast for us.  They made some nice restaurant recommendations as well. Second, the facilities.  The rooms are clean and comfortable; not at all outdated in my opinion.  The breakfast buffet is very generous.  The food at the rooftop restaurant is very good and the view of the Parthenon at night is BREATHTAKING! Lastly, the location is very convenient.  It is walking distance and a straight shot from the hotel to the Acropolis.  On the way you'll pass through quite a lot of shopping and dining options.  We had read reports that the hotel neighborhood had become somewhat \"sketchy\".  While the area is a bit run down, partly due to COVID shutdowns of businesses, we didn't see anything that that concerned us.  The streets are clean and rather quiet. The best review I can give a hotel is to vouch that, should we return to Athens, we will likely stay here again.…\n",

We could not have received a warmer welcome from the guy on reception - I'm sorry I did not get his name - and Mr Vangelis. So friendly and professional and extremely helpful. The cleaning staff were also wonderful and we really enjoyed our unexpected stay!   We will definitely return on next trip to Athens!  Thank you for such a relaxing and pleasant stay.\n",

      "Review is :We had booked a seven night cruise with Celestyal Cruises (also an excellent company) and had a night before the cruise and a night at the end of the cruise in the Polis Grand Hotel. The hotel was very central for everything.  The first thing we noticed was how friendly the staff were. They were helpful with everything, giving us information about the area and where the sights were. The people who found the staff unfriendly might need to check their own attitude.  When we arrived at the beginning, we only had a late afternoon and evening, so only looked around the immediate area. When we returned the following Saturday we arrived early at around 8am as the cruise docked early. We knew our room at that time would not be ready but the gentleman on the reception desk took in our luggage.  We then wanted to go to the Athens Archaeology museum and asked directions. He actually brought us out into the street and pointed where we needed to go. As it turned out the museum was a mere few minutes walk from the hotel and opens early at 8am.  Food was excellent. We had dinner and breakfast the first stay and breakfast the second stay. Restaurant staff were very nice and friendly as well.  We loved Athens there is plenty to see. On our second stay we visited the archeological museum and the acropolis. Acropolis was about 30 minutes walk from the hotel through a very colourful district with lots of shops and restaurants.  Photos below are from our room balcony and around the immediate area.  All in all if we are in Athens again we will be back.…\n",

The bed is very comfortable and the room is fairly quiet.  We enjoyed watching the sunset while dining at the rooftop restaurant, which has a panoramic view of the Acropolis and surrounding hills.

So, every time I needed to get something out or put something in I had to retrieve my suitcase from behind a chair and then repack it. The shower had no door so the bathroom got wet every time someone showered. There was one glass in the bathroom and one wine glass. I think this room should only be for 1 person. There was a thing to boil water but no tea or coffee provided so I’m not sure what it was for.I don’t understand how this is rated a 4 star hotel.\n",

Some highlights: - Great location, about a 15 minute walk to the Acropolis (the bottom of the hill- it'll take you about a half hour to walk up to the gate to pay the €20 entrance fee, and another 20 to walk up to the top). - Down the street (about 2 minute walk) is a really good bakery called the Apollonion. Highly recommend going here for fresh pastries and a frappe. We stocked up on baked goods to bring home the morning of our flight. They will wrap it for you in boxes and wrap. And yes, you can bring it over to Canada, just don't choose pastries with meat or cheese! - Staff/Service- very helpful.…\n",

The front desk attendants were very knowledgeable, experienced and always eager to help. They set up taxi service for me to and from airport and booked my tours for me. The food and the breakfast spread was amazing!!!!! The only complaint I have is that I got stuck with a small shower stall with very little water pressure. If you ever go to Athens, please visit this hotel. I traveled thru Greece on my own and I didn’t feel uncomfortable or uneasy at all. I had an amazing adventure\n",

We chose a room with a balcony overlooking the Parthenon. We weren't disappointed. We decided to eat in the restaurant on the top floor each night where we were able to sit outside and look out over the city. There was a good selection of food and the prices were reasonable.  The Parthenon and Museum were just a comfortable 20 minute walk away as were many other major sites.\n",

We had a huge private balcony. It was about a 10 minute walk to the center and all the activities, and a 5 munute walk from the archeological museum!! The only reason I did not rate it a 5/5 is because the neighborhood around the hotel made us feel like we needed cabs after dark. I would recommend this hotel and stay here again.\n",

All of the staff were very pleasant and very welcoming. The mini-bar in the bedroom was also a nice little feature that we didn’t expect, and was used and restocked throughout our stay. With amazing views of the acropolis from the roof top bar. Safe to say, if we were to stay in Athens again we will definitely be returning. Thanks for such a great city break.\n",

Our room was spotless with a double and single bed.  The bathroom was nice size with hot shower.  We did not hear our neighbors. The beds and pillows were comfortable and air conditioner was operated within room. We got in around 7 so decided to eat at hotel. Wow, so happy we did.  The food was awesome and the rooftop view to die for!!!  Waiters were helpful and wonderful service.  The area around the hotel felt very safe as we walked everywhere.

Generally I like to have control over my own bookings, but this vacation package was too good to pass up so we went for it. I have to say that the Polis really exceeded our expectations. The check in process was seamless.  The room was clean and comfortable and even had a small balcony.  The stocked mininbar was a welcome touch as after a long flight we were greatly in need of refreshments.  We did go up to the roof for cocktails at sunset and the view was spectacular.  The service at the bar on the roof was a bit slow, but seemed in keeping with the general approach in Athens, the drinks themselves…\n",

Returning in the early evening we were finally able to check in.   The hotel was easy to locate and is relatively close to Omonia square. The area around it was not very pleasant and the taxi driver advised us not to walk around it late at night. Nevertheless, inside the hotel, everything was clean and relatively new. The room was well equipped and the air conditioning did a decent job.  My concern was that despite repeated requests for a quiet room, and despite checking in late we ended up on the top floor under the much touted terrace bar.  Long into the night you could hear every movement of a table or the chair…\n",

Hop on and hop off bus is just on the Omonia square, which is better for tourists comparing to undergrand (to avoid pickpockets).   I have booked a room for a family (two adults and two children) for four nights. I have to say, the room is a bit tight for four and on the first night when we arrived, the bedding wasn't prepared for extra people. This is the only negative point. Apart from this, the staff were helpful, the breakfast was excellent and the room was clean. The taxi from hotel to Airport is euro 44 (flat rate).\n",

It was our honeymoon so we got a room with a private terrace and view of the Acropolis and it was so worth it! One thing to note was the location in the city.

He spent a lot of his time making sure we were taken care of, and not stranded in a foreign country. We only hope that our American counterparts are as kind if someone gets stranded.

First, it is an undesirable neighborhood/section of Athens; albeit, not far from a nicer area but for example - our tour guide got robbed in broad daylight directly outside the hotel.  The front desk staff was very rude, every time we asked a question or needed something we got the impression we were bothering them.  The room we were in was TINY like closet tiny - there were 3 of us and we could not all open our suitcases at the same time.  I think we had the 'comfort' room or something of the sorts which was nothing but comfortable.

The staff went out of their way to be helpful. Things to know - if you are claustrophobic get a room on the lower level as the elevator is the smallest I have ever seen. Had to stack our luggage so it would fit in with the 2 of us. The hotel has no washcloths so bring your own if you want one.

      "Review is :Lovely hotel, situated near Omonia Square. The view from our balcony, overlooking the street was of the Parthenon on top of the Acropolis. This view was even more spectacular from the rooftop terrace restaurant, where food was good and prices reasonable. The hotel was 3 mins from Omonia Metro which made it convenient to get around Athens. Room had tea and coffee facilities but we could hear people going along the corridor! Clean bathroom with toiletries. Television in the room but few watchable channels for us! BBC World news, CNN and a film channel. Room service available, and a small bistro cafe in Reception. Staff very polite and helpful and spoke good English. Breakfast: lots of fruit, yogurt and honey, together with continental breakfast and typical “English cooked…\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is not real fancy, but then again, if you're exploring during the day this place is perfect because it's close to almost every place you want to go in Athens. The rooftop restaurant is convenient to hang out at night since the view of the Acropolis is right in front of you. The night person at the front desk is very helpful and gives us tips on where to go and eat for cheap but authentic Greek cuisine. There is a nearby little restaurants that serve authentic Greek food made from scratch. I would recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues.\n",

      "Review is :This hotel was probably the best sleep on our vacation to Greece.  Mattress was comfy, sheets were nice, temperature good.  Thats important to me!  Our rooms were quiet.  Elevators were small and kind of annoying, but hey, it's Europe.  Restaurant up top was average.  Good for cocktails or a bottle of wine.  But the breakfast spread?  Hands down the best I have had at a hotel.  (But Im not a high roller so I am sure there is better but just for average me, the best)  You could try your hand at making your own Greek coffee in hot sand.  Takes a bit to figure it out, but try it!  You can make your own fresh squeezed orange juice.  Theres eggs, meats, fruits, salads, so good.  Location is good, we walked to house of Parliment, through the garden, down to Panthenaic stadium then…\n",

The location is very good, the rooms are clean, the breakfast is above average (there are too many options). The only problem that I had was the very very small shower (1m x 1m, something like that). Literally you cannot move in there. Also, visitors should be careful at night since even if the location is great, late at night there are always some strange faces around.\n",

No pancakes or waffles. The area around the hotel wasn’t the best for a family. There were homeless people around the streets and grafetti everywhere. I would rate this a 3 star hotel not a 4.\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is in a central location with a metro station nearby.  I stayed in a comfort room which was of a decent size, however; there was no view outside the window.    The area is ok, however; is known to be dangerous at night.  I was weary about this so made sure I was in by 10pm every night.   The bathroom was small and the shower was unbelievably tiny!  There was no room to move and it was difficult to shower properley.  The shower would no way accommodate a larger person so this is rather disappointing.  The breakfast was nice with plenty of choices and dinner was lovely too.    There was a nice food area within a minutes walk of the hotel; a few bakeries and local cafes etc at very affordable prices.  The rooftop view of the Acropolis at night is AWESOME!!  I would stay…\n",

The hotel is also located very near the train station and restaurants/cafes, so we didn’t have to use any taxis at all. Overall, the experience was great, and I would go back again for sure.\n",

Some people on my floor left in the middle of the night as were so shocked and upset went to the airport to leave Athens.

The main concierge looked like John Oliver. The breakfast spread was surprisingly extensive.  However, our room was suuuuuper loud. I don’t mean kind of loud. I mean really, really loud. I can sleep in New York, and even that background noise can be weirdly sleep-inducing. This hotel is on a street that just happens to be really loud. Like motorbikes revving right outside your window at 3am, consistently throughout the night. This isn’t necessarily the hotel’s fault.

The rooftop restaurant was very nice but again service was slack. They didn’t have enough help so they forgot things. Then when we went to the restaurant for breakfast. We told them we had only about 20 minutes they gave us water and serve everyone else around us. After 10 minutes we left and they didn’t bat an eye like they could care less. I was not impressed.\n",

Rooms are European adequate, however, Greece has the hardest beds I've ever encountered! Elevators will only accommodate about two people at a time with light luggage.

The hotel found us bigger adjoining rooms and it was fine from there. Guest manager and a few of the desk staff were awesome. Really good advice on how to get around and where extremely pleasant to deal with even though we almost checked out for a bigger place. Location is safe although i understand why some would think so and breakfast was really good. Highly recommend it for small families who want to be in the city center.

Our room had no table and the rooftop restaurant was okay, but we were busy seeing various museums and grabbed a quick snack before we set off to our next destination. Not wanting to eat in the room, we sat near the chess table hoping to enjoy our meal and play a game of chess. Into the first bite we were told it wasn't allowed and to eat downstairs near the smelly gym. So that put a damper on our stay. No table in the room, and Athens is very crowded so there was no room at the restaurant either. It was a catch 22, but we had hoped to quickly eat before taking an uber to our next stop.

Balcony was useless as there is a huge air con unit standing on it.

      "Review is :This is a stylish, elegant hotel situated in central Athens.  The facilities were more than satisfactory.  And the staff at this hotel are professional kind and helpful.  One early morning my son and I tried out the hotel gym.  In the midst of our session a staff member brought us two cold bottles of water. How considerate!  The staff were always informative and helpful whatever the inquiry.  A particular attraction is the rooftop restaurant.  If you arrive evening time choose this restaurant for your first meal.  You won't be disappointed.  The view of the Acropolis is sublime and memorable.  The choice at breakfast is considerable and all that can be desired.  Rooms are clean and functional, though basic.  I would wholeheartedly recommend the Polis Grande.  The plaka and…\n",

      "Review is :Polis Grand Hotel was a great hotel right near the center of the city and the Acropolis. It's only about a 15 minute, or so, walk to the Acropolis and all the bars, restaurants and shops near it. The surroundings can be a little intimidating, but you have to remember that Athens is a large city, and at that, a large city whose country is still recovering from recession. There's lots of graffiti and some homeless people, but it is relatively safe in this sector (Athens is huge). Aside from that, the rooms are somewhat small, but the hotel had an amazing rooftop restaurant that had a nice view of the Acropolis at night.

The breakfast selection includes the standard hot dishes (omelette, grilled tomato, bacon, boiled eggs, sausages etc ) as well as homemade choices (cheese pie, cakes, jams....try the fig jam!), pastries, antipasti and make-your-own Greek coffee.  40 mins from the airport.

The hotel itself is safe:  the location is not.  Apparently, at one time, the hotel was in a great location; however, that is not the case today.  Not only did that driver warn us about the location, but so did our tour guide the next day and another transfer driver.

Overall, the neighborhood is a little shabby but to be honest Athens if full of graffiti.  Hotel is skimpy on towel which are poor quality.  Very limited TV offerings.  Good breakfast room and selection but don't expect omelettes.  Bottled water is very cheap in Athens but is marked up considerable at restaurants where there is no free water.  A very strange practice common in Europe.\n",

The beds were extremely soft and comfortable (even more than my bed at home!), the staff was helpful and friendly, the rooftop terrace restaurant had a great view of the Acropolis, and the breakfast was the best I had in Greece. The rooms also provided hair dryers and a safe if you needed it. I thought the location was fairly central.

The Hotel is a 3.5/5 in my opinion.  The hotel itself is clean, but like many European Hotels – the room is very small, as is the bathroom.  However; the daily breakfast on the second floor is very well equipped and well worth it.  They put out a lot of hot and cold dishes, plus all the small things you would like to see in a breakfast (too many things to list, including the drinks).  Overall, this hotel is nice and the service is friendly, and is good for a quick 2 day stopover, on your way to see other part of Greece (ie…The Greek Isles).

Hotel itself is nice -- area surrounding hotel, not so much.  Area seemed a bit shady.  We DID walk around the city, but only during the day and took cabs back after dark.  Definitely watch purses and wallets, etc. as you do get approached for handouts.  We really didn't have any major problems and found most people helpful.

Beds were very comfortable, AC worked great, and bathroom was very spacious. Yes the included breakfast is as good as everyone says - salads, eggs, meats, tomatoes, mushrooms, bread of every variety, veggies, 5-6 types of cakes, coffee, yogurt station, fresh fruit, make your own greek coffee in sand, amazing fresh flavored waters, greek pies, and more! laundry service is sent out and was 12 Euros for a large bag. Staff was helpful and efficient. Great view of Acropolis from rooftop bar.\n",

This was furthered by the elevators. My sister is very claustrophobic, and immediately I can say if you have someone in your family that is, do not stay here. We were placed on the 7th floor and waited about 15 minutes because the elevators are very slow. In the morning there were lines to get down because they took so long. The rooms are also quite small, but are fine for what they are. The pros of this hotel are the location and the dining options. During the day there is a lot going on around the area, and it isn't too far from the Acropolis. The restaurant upstairs was also pretty good and had a nice view…\n",

We were on the 7th floor but still very noisy - especially noticeable at night. Weird experience in the restaurant - booked half board - absolutely NO CHOICE - not even a table d'hote menu!!! We were just presented with whatever they decided we were having that evening - tried to sort something out with the management - they just didn't get it! To be honest, I'd avoid the restaurant altogether - food wasn't that great - we found a great 'street-food' chicken shop around the corner that did great home-style…\n",

The staff is nice and ready to assist.  Negatives: rooms are small, you have place just to go around bed. Baths are so small that for a tall person is hard to have shower and need updated but are very clean. Forget about views to Acropolis from room: there is a tall building under construction just in front of them. Anyway you can see Acropolis only a little from rooms on last floors or if you want a large nice view from last floor open bar terrace. There are renovated rooms…\n",

Coming out of the metro, you walk a cobblestone-like path to get to the main entrance. Very easy to find.   We were greeted by the staff, but arrived at approximately 12:30, checkin is 2pm. The staff tagged and held our bags while we grabbed some street food from near the metro station. We were able to also wait in the hotel bistro, which boasts free Wifi.   The rooms are tiny, but manageable. All have balconies, but the views are definitely run-down buildings and unsightly graffiti.

There was a huge lack of professionalism from the staff. I would suggest other hotels within the nearby area\n",

Our room was very spacious. We had the top floor room with a wrap around balcony. It had the perfect view of the Acropolis. The view was more amazing at night. The shower heads in the bathroom was really awesome. Especially after a long day of walking, a nice hot shower was perfect. The location was great because everything was only a couple minutes away on feet.\n",

Superior rooms were a little tight so if you enjoy space go next one up. Shower and bathroom was so small I was banging my elbows on everything have a hard time bending down to pick up the soap if you drop it, if thats gives an idea how small shower is. Im not a big guy (200lbs) so if you are a bigger person this would most likely make you even more uncomfortable. Location is great, its a straight shot to square and acropolis area.\n",

The rooftop bar is worth a visit for its spectacular views, even if it is expensive for the area.  The lifts are small and the downside was there were mosquitoes in my room which liked biting me in the night. This must be a common problem, as there are coils on reception. However, I didn't think to mention it until I checked out.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept well.  The best thing was the massive breakfast. There is so much choice, and you will have fun trying everything out - including fresh juice and Greek-style coffee.  Overall, a great stay and I'd happily go there again. It's a good location and only two minutes' walk from the metro. Recommended!\n",

Whilst everything was going wrong at the apartment, I also had some very important documents I needed some legal help with. I spoke to Vasilis at the Front Desk, who is the Customer Service Manager. He bent over backwards and used personal contacts to resolve our legal paperwork problem. This was done within 24 hours and at no charge.   Rarely have I ever seen such professionalism to customer service. Once again I would like to thank Vasilis for your invaluable help at a very difficult time. I am happy to recommend this hotel, based on the customer service from the Front Desk. It puts the many of the 5 star hotel Concierge services I have experienced, to shame.\n",

Lovely filling breakfast which sets you up for the day ahead. The rooftop bar & restaurant offers views of the acropolis and surrounding areas. In the summer months I think it would be a great place to sit and relaxing after a long day out exploring Athens. The rooms were smaller than expected but extremely well maintained and clean. I wouldn't say paying extra to upgrade from a classic to superior is necessary unless you wish to be on a higher floor of the hotel. Small gym available to use free of charge within the hotel also. Overall I would stay here again.\n",

We parked outside the hotel with no problems although I could see this might be an issue at other times of the year - the staff did point out a reasonably priced car park not far away.

The view from the balcony is, if you make a giraffe-neck, veeeery nice, because you see Akropolis. But all night long there is rumour, because there is much traffic doesn´t end. The window and balconydoor didn´t help. For two nights it is ok, but for longer, I would have changed the room to the backfront of the hotel. This was offered at the last day. So be clever and ask for it as soon as you think that it is too loud. The stuff is absolutely kind and helpful! Great! The comfort after a bad night is the incredible breakfast buffet!! No wish remains!!   If I come back to Athens, I would choose the hotel again.\n",

Don't expect luxury or a great big room-the rooms is pretty tight and so is the bathroom but we didn't mind it since by the end of the day all wanted was a decent night's sleep which we got. FYI- the elevator is really small so if u hv some luggage you will have to squeeze in:)\n",

All in all a very good value for money.

Breakfast WOW one of the best selections I have ever seen at breakfast time, take a hint take your time prior to starting and walk right round the breakfast room so you do not miss anything. If you want 5 star luxury pay the price, we have stayed in some fancy hotels over the years but if in Athens and you are spending all day sightseeing then this is a good place to be.

Great people, great rooms, great restaurant, great food, great beds, great..........well, you get the picture!\n",

Free safe in the room. Staff are friendly.  Continental breakfast has so much to choose from there has to be something you like.  Rooftop restaurant has fantastic views of the Acropolis at night.  Lift is small but there are two.  Close to Omonia Square for the metro, about 5 minute walk.  Or take a left out of the hotel main entrance, then right onto the main road and you head into the city centre.  However, go right and you are heading into a rough part of town so beware.\n",

Anecdote : The day before our departure, I asked the staff to call a taxi for the next morning. They warned me that there was a strike of air traffic controllers. This allowed us to take our steps to find another way to back home. The end of the trip was difficult but the staff helped us a lot in our efforts.\n",

Cons- very small rooms, breakfast was average, have to use dark back alley to get to the hotel from the Omonia metro station which can be a bit intimidating at night, was quite safe for us though. Would recommend if you only need a bed and breakfast and would be spending most of the time out sightseeing. Take the room facing the street, they are slightly bigger - room 301 for example.\n",

There is know one to take your bags so you have to take them up to your room yourself in the tiny elavators.Room was clean modern and comfotable,our room was overlooking the main road . The Breakfeast to me was pretty average the scrambeled eggs were horrible like they were made with egg powder all the the other food was ok but if you wanted toast you would have to wait five minutes for your bread to get half toasted, time they invested in a new commercial toaster! But overall the hotel was good value for money .\n",

It is located in omonia, which is run down and doesn't look very safe for tourists. The rooms were tiny. There is no room service past 10pm? There also isn't a place to go eat in the area, you would need to take a train a few stops away to Acropolis. On a positive note the breakfast was a buffet and was decent. I would not recommend. If I were to go back to Athens I would book a hotel by Acropolis.\n",

This hotel is just one block from Omonia Square.  Thus, it was very easy to get around town.  Even though we didn't know it at the time, the green line, which goes through Omonia Square, ends at the port of Pireaus. If we had known that, we could have saved a lot of money (taxi is a fixed fare of 22 Euros from the hotel to the port).  We did figure that out on the return trip.    In giving this review, you should know that I have been to 74 countries and traveled overseas (from US) 170+ times (40+ to Europe).  Thus, I have stayed in quite a few hotels.

At no time did we feel unsafe. Also great for walking. 20 min walk to everywhere. Platka, Acropolis,etc.  The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly. Only minor complaint was an unexpected room move during the middle of my stay. Oversold in my room type. Double room facing the street with balcony into a super small single room with window into interior walls. I recommend booking the double rooms.

The buffet breakfast was pretty basic but descent and the restaurant upstairs had a very nice view of Acropolis.  The only negative was that they put two small beds together to make one bed. That was somewhat unfcomfortable.   Staff were quiet me helpful and friendly.  Location was ideal and close to metro access.\n",

With the station behind, facing in to the square you turn left, left at the first set of lights then second block down on the left. I was told by the police \"to be very careful walking around the area\". Just be aware as in any large city.  I received a pleasant welcome and the room was modern, clean and in good order. The bathroom was a little tired but clean with good towels, toiletries and plenty of hot water. The bed was most comfortable.  Breakfast is a good spread with surely something to suit all tastes and a few things new delights to try.  As some say, there is a degree of passing traffic noise but overall I was happy with my stay, good staff and good value.\n",

The down mattress topper and duvet made it feel like crawling into a cocoon, very comfortable. The room and bathroom were immaculate and as a retired Executive Housekeeper in 5* hotels, I was impressed with the cleanliness. It had a small balcony from which, looking to the right, had a lovely view of the Parthenon. No balcony chairs, but it was mid winter, so possibly they take them in. My only real bugbear with the room, was that tablecloths, when used, were not replaced. Toilet rolls and toiletries were replaced daily, which was unnecessary. We booked in the restaurant for New Year's Eve dinner, but we're told we had to eat in the Roof Garden restaurant.…\n",

Though the room smells moldy, and you can see it right off the bat in the bathroom where the mold circles the tub handle.   Staff were really nice and warm, in fact people in Greece in general are very welcoming.  Breakfast spread is alot better compared to the 5star hotels we stayed in santorini and Mykonos. i enjoyed all the homemade jams and tasted all of them.

Considered thats not the safest area to be in Athens you feel safe enough to walk back to the hotel. Better get a cab (only 5-10 Euros). The hotel itself is a classic 4**** city hotel. The suite has impressive views and two spaces. Nice light colour scheme. Big bathroom with power shower facilities. Nice breakfast with fresh ingredients.  If you are looking for a hotel to be in the centre of the city in a reasonable price thats the place you are looking for. Walking distance to shops, bars, restaurants and Acropolis. Good value for money. The only negative it was the cleanliness. Throughout our stay nobody cleaned…\n",

When we entered, a small surprise - room small and the shower even smaller so one person could barely get in. Then when we turned the air conditioner on, it started leaking water like it was raining in the middle of autumn. We asked for a new room and the receptionist said he will check if there is one and that this is not a problem. After 30 min we went to reeception desk and asked the new room and finaly got it. The new one was larger, there was no large bed but ok, you can`t have them all. Next day we hanged \"do not disturb\" sign but after coming back to the room realised that someone was inside.

Having said that they are clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The public areas such as the roof top bar were good.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was very good value at an additional 8 euro on the room price.  The hotel is not in the best area which is a little seedy and run down.  Having said that we had no problems and the metro station is a 5 min walk away.  There is also a secure car park just 100 metres away which is well worth using.  In summary would we use this hotel again.  Yes but we would want the room deal that we had which with breakfast was around 65 euro…\n",

Room was comfortable and buffet breakfast had a good selection. View from the Rooftop restaurant was great and dinner was good. Reception staff were very helpful. Flat rate taxi fares between the airport and hotel/city centre and with the port which made it a relief to know that all was set and didn't have to worry that we might get ripped off. The area may seem a bit run down but once you turn the corner from the hotel and get on the main street it's perfectly fine and easy to navigate.  Would happily stay again.\n",

The driver gives you ear plugs that allow you to plug in beside your seat and hear the commentary regarding the points of interest.  You select from 8 - 10 languages and select that channel (2 for English)  It's a great way to get around.

However all the executive room balconys are right next to each other with only small fences in between, so we were lucky not to have neighbours those days ;)   Breakfast is OK, could be better. Anyway the restaurant at the roof is awesome and the food is super tasty! They have the best moussaka I've ever tasted!   The gym is very poor, so don't expect lot from it. Only really light handweights, so there's not much you can do.   The hotel is close to the centre, and you can easily walk to the Acropolis (about 30minutes).

The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was AMAZING! so much choice and set you up for a day of sightseeing! We did a hop on/hop off bus tour which was well worth it! I can really recommend this as it will save your feet! There are 3 main bus tours, a blue one, a red one and a yellow one. They all stop at the same areas and I think were all around the same price, 15euros a person and ours was an extra day included.

The staff is very friendly and always ready to assist at any time. Me and wife stayed thr for 3 nights, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff were very courteousness, they also presented us traditional blue eye bracelet. Oh I have mention the breakfast, it was delicious. The array of choices for breakfast was brilliant and also a special mention of the roof top restaurant which has a beautiful view of the Acropolis. I will recommend everybody to stay at Polis Grand. :)\n",

I couldn't tell if this was a good area or not with it being my first visit to Greece.  I received a warm welcome as the staff came out of the doors to meet me at the shuttle with a huge smile! This put me at ease and I was pleased with the decor of the hotel. Felt nice and trendy.  I was in room 807. Horrible view but very quiet. Reviews talked about how nice the balconies are but my understanding is those rooms can be loud as this is a high traffic, shopping area.  The room is a good size.

Room: On the first night, we were in room 708 facing the street - pretty noisy but has a great view of the Acropolis.

Surroundings: Not the greatest, but okay.  Service: friendly staff.  We were debating whether to give a 3 or 4-star. The noisy room on the first night should only deserve at most a 3-star.

The rooms are lovely and clean a nice large comfortable bed and TV. Kettle facility is provided upon request.

The room itself was fully furnished and well-kept - perhaps the only drawback was that we were given only one key-card so we could not split up or leave items charging during breakfast.  But the free WI-FI compensated! Final point: There's a bakery which remains open 24/7 across the street. We would definitely go back there if we visit Athens again.\n",

      "Review is :Hmmmmm, On arrival at the front of this hotel you cant help but look at the surrounding buildings and wonder where you are? Graffiti covered, closed buildings surround this hotel. However once you step inside the actual nice hotel facade, there are redeeming qualities. I stayed here 6 nights over a week, (I had an island cruise in between and had two different rooms.) The first one faced the back of the hotel, could see rooftops and not much else but it was on the floor below the rooftop restaurant and view, so that wasn't too bad. The second room I got faced the front of the hotel and had a little balcony and if you where on the balcony, you got a view of the Acropolis, really good at night. Both rooms had good beds, where quiet, the only thing I hated was the shower, it was…\n",

We booked one of the one day cruises to the island of Hydra (99 Euro per person), the cruise was a great deal and fully worth it.

About a 5 min walk from the metro stop. The room was clean, modern and had a good view of Lycabettus hill. Every night we visited the rooftop bar for great quality food at really reasonable prices, it was perfect as there didn't seem many restaurants in the area - also the view from the rooftop is amazing - every night we would sit and enjoy the view of the Parthenon lit up - beautiful!

Since we were not staying long, price was the main consideration, and the Polis seemed to be a good compromise in this regard. For a 4star, it is quite inexpensive.

      "Review is :At first impressions the location of the hotel was in a shabby part of Athens, but safe area.   The hotel itself was well presented clean, with helpful staff and rooms were of a good standard and sizes with a electronic safe. 5mins from Omonia metro, around the hotels are many eateries and cafes, with a supermarket less than 8 mins away (called Bizzare).  A fantastic base to explore Athens from.  The roof top bar/restureant was fantastic, the views are just like the web site, AMAZING!, with good quality food and drinks at reasonable prices.  Good Points -Powerful shower, good temperature control. -Breakfast with a huge selection of Greek, Continental, cooked choice.  Squeeze your own orange juice machine, super fresh. -Roof top bar, good food, amazing views -Helpful staff.  Bad…\n",

Very clean, the staff very friendly and helpful, excellent bars and restaurants including one on the roof terrace with fabulous views of the Acropolis and Likevitou Hill.  It is within walking distance of the main attractions,  close to the Archaeology Museum and bus terminal, and very handy for the tube in Omonia Square (this last has had some negative reviews, but we had no problems).  The Club Neon restaurant is just around the corner, if you want a change from the hotel menus. We had a great week here and can recommend it unreservedly.\n",

When we looked out the small balcony and to the right there was the Parthenon! The price was unbelievably cheap in the off season. There is a very nice little restaurant downstairs. Also there's a bar on the roof with a terrific view of the Acropolis and is just magic at night!. It was a pleasure spending the week there and we will be happy to return in the future.   There are lots of eateries nearby and it is a nice walk to the markets, parliament house (for the changing of the guard) and onto the acropolis.

The views from the roof top bar were amazing!  The breakfast was very nice too.  The only issue we had was that as soon as we mentioned Omonia to the taxi driver where the hotel was he did not speak highly of it and said that we should be careful.    We followed advice and can say that we experienced no problems at all, although we did make sure we were not hanging around the area of Omonia at night just in case.   Overall we had a wonderful time, Athens is stunning but it would have been nice to have known more about the area as we would probably have booked somewhere else.\n",

Good central location although be careful of the 1 and 1/2 one way system in the road (3lanes go one way and one the other - its the other that can get you!!). The roof garden is lovely. I found the breakfast a bit hard going - not as tasty as expected BEWARE THE BOILED EGGS.  The one downfall is that there is no tea of coffee facilities in the rooms - trying to get a cup of tea from room service is a bit hit and miss.  AsK for everything you need - boiling water, teabags, sugar milk.\n",

Staff was very friendly, they helped me to choose the room I liked mostly.You can choose rooms with the city view or the most quiet behind the main building. Breakfast was rich,you can taste traditional specialties like cheese pies, omelets, Greek cakes like milk-pie or halvas, fresh fruit salad and fresh orange juice! You can also make Greek coffee in special home made way \"hovoli: with hot sand device ..!!  Best of all of course is the roof Garden Restaurant Bar with the spectacular view of Athnes enjoying your delicious dinner or drinking an exotic cocktail!

The hotel was lovely, the room was comfortable, with a very good shower, and the breakfast was excellent with a good variety. The rooftop bar was pleasant and relaxed with good views. The area around Omonia was run down but nowhere near as unpleasant as I'd expected from other reviews online, and the hotel is handily placed for the metro or even walking to the acropolis region or syntagma, if you don't mind a 20-30minute walk.   As for the negatives:  The room had no tea or coffee making facilities (although it did have a minibar). Traffic noise from the road outside was loud. It wasn't very easy to find the first time, so plan your route there carefully! Probably not a 4* hotel-…\n",

The staff were friendly and helpful, there was a great choice at breakfast, which was fresh and well stocked whatever time you got up and everywhere was clean.  We ate in the restaurant on the roof a couple of times, the food was very good and the views amazing! Two slight negatives - the noise from outside which cannot be helped - the hotel has done what it can by installing shutters to pull across the windows; also the very small shower tray does not contain all the water so the floor stays wet until the room is cleaned again.  Overall we would have no hesitation in recommending the Polis Grand and we will be staying there again…\n",

Was a quiet oasis of calm in this busy area, and the choice and range of food was very good. You can have from a small snack to a full blown lunch, and that choice in the one place in Greece is not that usual. Interesting, very fresh sandwich choices and all the food we had and saw was lovely. Spotlessly clean, again the exception to the rule, as some of the cafes/eating places in this area are what you could describe as a bit too full of local earthiness. Reasonable prices too, well worth a visit.\n",

On venturing out later at about 7:30pm, it looked entirely different - deserted and rather rough.  However that was a Monday evening and subsequent evenings were not so bad. I noticed Athenians in evidence walking around purposefully so I believe it is not dangerous - just be aware of your surroundings.    The hotel is in quite a convenient location for everything with good transport and lots of taxis around.  At first the rooms look rather unenticing - quite small - and the carpet has seen better days.  However they were spotlessly clean, including the linens and the bathroom.

Polis is centrally located whereas you can get on the Metro Line & go anywhere.  The man working the reception desk (Bill) was very kind, assisted us in all aspects of our stay.

We found the service to be very good.  Questions were answered in a professional, polite and helpful manner.  We were tired the first night so had room service dinner from the hotel restaurant.  The food was delivered by a very friendly young man and the food was very good.  The room had lots of light (important to me), was quiet, and the bed was comfortable. The shower was great as was the A/C.    The buffet breakfast is held in a beautifully decorated room and the food is varied and plentiful.  Even if you pay extra for it, their buffet breakfast is definitely worth any extra cost.    The area is walkable to different restaurants (we went to God's Restaurant, having good memories of it 10 years ago) and easy to walk to the Acropolis and Museum.…\n",

Dimitris was friendly and helpful, but the other staff not as much. The rooms are small and a bit tired. My duvet was clean but had old stains. The bench in bathroom had quite a bit of hair on it, I think they forgot to clean it. The bathroom is very dark so I had to put makeup on in the main room. Breakfast was ok, a decent amount to choose from but there was hair near some of the selections. The quality of the food was ok. Overall the hotel was fine and priced well but just not what we were expecting based on the reviews. The view from the roof bar was nice, especially at night. The location was excellent.\n",

They can’t do enough to help you sort out whatever problems you have. The best staff ever, and I dont say this lightly. We usually stay at Grande Bretagne , yes the rooms are much superior but I can’t praise the staff here. Magnificent! Thank you all.\n",

The room is quiet, a balcony with chairs is provided, the air conditioning is self-controlled and quiet, and breakfast is included. The staff is always professional and friendly. If you have any questions, they speak flawless English. You can't beat the location for the Acropolis Museum as it is a short block walk to the entrance, and there are tavernas nearby if you don't want to eat at the hotel restaurant. You are in a neighborhood area instead of touristy Plaka, so you will see locals at the tavernas, and many very good restaurants clustered together a short walk toward the Fix Metro. Breakfast is very good with something for everyone, and the breakfast room is charming. Our room was clean and comfortable with cool sheets and comfortable pillows. The bathroom is all black marble. A couple of things to note in the bathroom: the tub wall is really high, so if you have mobility issues, you should ask if they have rooms with walk-in showers. Also, something we noticed in many hotels on our tour of Greece this time, hotels are not necessarily providing bar soap. We used shower gel to wash our hands, and housekeeping could easily see that is what we were doing, but no bar soap appeared. The room provided plenty of storage for hanging clothes. We had an excellent stay and look forward to returning soon.…\n",

We had a minor ferry scheduling issue and the men at the front desk did the most for us in terms of calling the car company, ferry company and making sure we made out ferry on time. The rooms were average rooms but on the bigger side. Very clean and comfortable.

The hotel, as well as having its own restaurant, is very handily situated for some 10 to 12 reataurants all within a few hundred yards further up the street. Breakfast was very good and extensive - and Covid precautions were very evident throughout the hotel. The hotel is handily positioned within walking distance of Syntagma Sqaure, Parliament Building and the Plaka. It has handy access to the Acropolis Museum and South East entrance to the Acropolis Hill and much can be seen on the walk up to the Parthenon.

It's worth it to pay extra for the 5th floor Jr Suite for the lovely view of the Acropolis especially when it's all lit up at night.  The things that I enjoy when traveling as far as accommodations were all here at the Hera...china cup for my coffee, bathtub or shower option, storage for my clothes so I don't have to live out of my suitcase. And unique.  I don't enjoy the cookie cutter hotels that have the same plastic wood grained furniture that I see over and over. The Hera has real wood furniture!

We only spent one night at the Hera Hotel, but found the room comfortable and large enough with a large balcony to enjoy the view.  We initially planned to have our teen sleep in the sofa bed and it would have been tight with 3 in the room, but doable.  Instead we booked a small regular room for 2 teens, and they even had a small balcony (without a view).  The breakfast is worth including in your room, plenty of food and a great start to a full day of sightseeing.  COVID precautions are in place, and we enjoyed our stay.\n",

Our reception experience was friendly and helpful.  The top floor restaurant's dinner menu is, of course, limited in selections but offering tasty options. Make reservations for a table with the Acropolis view! Mixologist Nilson Bit is one of the best! Try his Aperol Spritz for an apéritif and/or a Limoncello for a digestif. Strike up a conversation with Nilson to enjoy his dry sense of humor. Nice breakfast buffet on entry level and made-to-order omelets, etc. are available.

I continued to question him and he finally said our room included free breakfast and that's why it is more which seemed fair and we agreed to pay the higher price.  The next morning we went to breakfast where they charged us 15 euros each - we complaned but the front desk manager, Demetrius, claimed he never said breakfast was free.  Be very careful, this hotel takes advantage of Americans, we ended up paying 120 euros more than quoted and the rooms were small and ours overlooked a trash dump. …\n",

Our rooms were nicely decorated and cleaned daily. Our room faced the street and had a small balcony where we could sit and enjoy the sunshine.

It was a bit slow but unlike another hotel I've stayed in while in Athens, it seemed to go to all the floors. I was on the 1st floor on the back side: basically a large air shaft so no view but very quiet. Those on the street talked of being wakened by noise. Breakfast was included and was very nice only lacking fresh fruit selection beyond bananas and apples. You can order an omelette which is very good or pay extra to order from the a la carte menu. Otherwise the fare is pretty much as expected: scrambled eggs, meat, grilled tomatoes, cheeses, yogurt, etc. In the room, large and comfortable, the temperature control was a bit mysterious and in the end it was either cool down to too cold or heat…\n",

The first night was a great experience, arrived early in the morning and left our luggage with the hotel, while we did some sightseeing.  Came back and were able to get into our room.  A very comfortable room, no view, but you pay more for a view.  The bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast next morning, included in the price was excellent. The second night was not as good.  I was unaware of the difference in size in room.  The bed was only a double, the room was minute, the bathroom also very small.  Very disappointed.  However, the location of the hotel is excellent.  Lots of food options. Walk to many sites.\n",

Toilet ran the whole first night until I got tired of listening to it & fixed it myself. To flush the toilet, you’re supposed to push a button on top of the tank. That didn’t work so you had to lift the whole tank lid up, which was connected to the inner guts of the toilet & made it flush. The shower would randomly alternate between too cold & scalding hot so you’d be shivering then burning. Minor complaints overall but I wouldn’t stay here again.\n",

The bathroom had a very bad sewage odor that carried into the small room if you left the door ajar. I explained that to the front desk shortly after check-in and they said they would send someone up to put some air freshener or something. I don't think they ever did though and if they did....it certainly didn't make a difference. We were only there for one night, otherwise would have insisted on moving to another hotel or at least a room that didn't stink.

Plenty of places to walk and go get lunch, dinner or a drink. Hotel was very Quaint, staff were very helpful with any questions and tours.  Rooms were very clean and the bed was comfy.  Not too much to complain about at all. Only one small issue was first night air on worked well and second night it seemed to be on but really didn't work too well.  Otherwise, I stayed at hotel by reading advice of other TripAdvisor's and glad we booked at hotel.\n",

For our arrival on both stays, we used their ride service they offer on their website and the welcoming emails I received before arriving. This is not a service run by the hotel, but a service they recommend, and it is well worth booking. The email also provided a quick survey of your interests and they then suggested sites you might enjoy seeing in Athens. On both arrivals, we were greeted with friendly faces and were sent off to our room quickly. The elevator is slow and small, as are most elevators in older buildings we've encountered in Europe.

Breakfast was good but not as good as an inexpensive hotel we went to early in our trip.

Nothing is too much trouble - for example, looking after a laptop during the day and printing boarding passes when we left.  Very comfortable bed; good linen.  Breakfast plentiful.  The coffee in the flasks was a bit thin - but they'd make an espresso if one asked.

The area has a sort of village feel about it, whereas Syntagma Square is bland & noisy and Monastiraki seems to lose some of its shine at night (although this is January, so it might not be the case in the summer).

      "Review is :Absolutely disgusted and bitterly dissapointed.  We spent the day out from morning until late evening in Athens. When we got back to the hotel,  we found that our room had been cleaned by the housekeeping staff.   When I went to find my charger to charge my phone,  I saw to my horror that the charger had been swapped to a lower grade plug without USB slots. The charge plug we had had an additional 2 USB ports beneath the socket which we bought specifically for our needs.   The thing that shocked me the most was that the charger was INSIDE my bag left on the table. This tells me that not only are the staff dishonest enough to steal but that they had the audacity to be rummaging through bags.   Shaking with disbelief and mild shock, we went to speak to reception. The man behind…\n",

I would say there's just two things worth mentioning. First, my room was high up and there's only one, small elevator. This might not be an issue for some, but I'm claustrophobic, so it's worth mentioning. Second, I was catching a tour within an hour of my arrival, so I needed a quick place to eat. They suggest the same restaurant to everyone who arrives, and it's directly across the street. It's a nice, sit-down place. Since I had no time, I asked for another recommendation, and they said…\n",

I'd say the best thing about Hera Hotel is the close proximity to the Acropolis and the Monastiraki Flea Market (about a 10-15 min walk away), as well as the shower head (it had amazing water pressure haha).  Make sure to also sign their leather guest book when you check out!  :)\n",

Our suite overlooked the Acropolis, and had a huge balcony.  The bathroom was classic black marble, with a big tub and great shower that doubled as a hand held.  The soft colors of gold and beige in the room just made it feel luxe, warm, and homey.  You can feel that its a family owned space.  The mattress is also AMAZING.  Complimentary tea and Nespresso machine was also in our room, and since we had a suite, there was also a lovely bottle of complimentary wine.   Location cannot be beat, you pretty much can walk to every single touristic site, and the…\n",

Great location which is about a 2 minute walk to restaurants and shops, the Acropolis and Parthenon, but yet far enough away where you have peace and quiet.  Wonderful, friendly, and very helpful staff.  Enjoyed their breakfast very much.  Would I stay here again?  Absolutely, yes!  Highly recommended.\n",

The staff stored our luggage, offered us complimentary breakfast and a place to freshen up.Following this they helped secure reservations for dinner, reserve a rental car and arrange a private tour.  They were pleasant and so willing to help with anything we asked. The rooms although on the smaller side were well kepted and well equipment with comfortable beds.  Breakfast buffet was good and again great service with a smile. It’s a small boutique hotel in a great location.. we’re returning at the end of our trip for one more night.\n",

There are many restaurants nearby the hotel and you can easily find a restaurant suits you . Look from the roof garden of the hotel, you can see the Acropolis. Our room is in 3rd floor, with a balcony that can see Acropolis as well . The room is very good, clean, quite, bed is comfortable , the AC is very cool . Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.

The breakfast was the best of all the five hotels we stayed in during our time in Italy and Greece.  The room was well appointed and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful.   The real winner here though is the location and the rooftop restaurant. We ate here our first night and went back every night after that! The food and house wines are delicious and the view cannot be beat!   It’s an easy walk to the Acropolis museum, subway, and great little restaurants.

He called for a reservation and arranged for a taxi to be ready to take us to the funicular so we could enjoy a spectacular sunset and a wonderfully tasty meal.

Free breakfast was delicious (European style). Delicious restaurant with top notch service at top floor (Peacock restaurant) with incredible view of Acropolis. Rooms were clean and comfortable (on small side but we didn’t spend much time in room so that was fine for us) and had balcony with incredible view. Couple with teen daughter traveled together. Got room with king bed and sleep sofa/chair that was perfect (much better than American sleep type sofas/chairs).. Great neighborhood and walkable location to Acropolis, museum, restaurants and other important sites in Athens. We’ll stay here again if we come back! Thank you…\n",

We loved it so much because of the friendly staff and perfect location. It's at the foot of the Acropolis, with so many restaurants and shops all around. The area is safe and it's less than 10 euro to taxi to the port, if you get a good driver who doesn't scam you. The room was cozy - not a whole lot of room, but we didn't need much because the only time we were in the room was to sleep. Highly recommend, especially for the price. And the rooftop restaurant had EXCELLENT food. Our bartender wasn't overly friendly, but no complaints.\n",

Everything you need to see and experience in this neighborhood. Although I didn't take the metro, this hotel was also 2 min walk to the Acropolis stop. The hotel itself was very friendly and welcoming. I had one breakfast there and it was a nice selection. The rooftop has amazing views too! (but I didn't eat at the restaurant).

The room was OK, you can tell it is a very old hotel (duh) because of the smell. The bathrooms (room and Peacock restaurant) would not flush sometimes, but would always  work after 1-2 hrs.

My only downsides were that the hairdryer was pretty rubbish, Wi-Fi not good and the fact that our room was right on the end of the hotel next to where the Tiki Bar is.

      "Review is :We stayed two nights at the Hera Hotel during our trip around Greece.  This is a small upscale boutique hotel located almost at the base of the acropolis.  It is all about location and service.  It is within easy walking distance to the metro, the acropolis museum, and the back entrance to the acropolis.  Hadrian's arch and the Temple of Olympian Zeus are also within easy walking distance.  There are many shops and restaurants in the surrounding area including a few grocery stores.  We had a room on the 5th floor with nice sized balcony with views of the acropolis.  Breakfast was included in our rate (but not all) and was a typical Greek breakfast served on the first floor.  The hotel does offer a car service to and from the airport.  We took the metro from the airport to the…\n",

The Hera fit the bill to a tee!  Located just a few blocks down from the Acropolis entrance, you can’t beat its location!  We also had the unfortunate experience of having a lost wallet in our group.... someone who found it on the ground, contacted the Hera front desk with information found in the wallet... with their kind help and one of our cell phones, we were able to meet up with the young man who found the wallet and got back everything but the cash...

It was located in the closet but on the bottom of the closet. It was next to the wall and nightstand so you couldn’t access it to put your valuables.   - Breakfast options are OK but could be a little better for the money you pay  - The shower is odd bc you have a very high step into the tub. And the drain in the bathroom caused a foul odor to permeate the room. We put our garbage can over top of it to lessen the smell, which helped.  …\n",

We were on the 4th floor with an acropolis view. Don't think the extra cost is worth this. The view is nice from the balcony, but the room is west facing and it is too hot to sit outside in the sun at any time of day. The rooftop restaurant has a spectacular view and whether you dine there or just come up at sunset for drinks and dessert, it is far superior to your balcony. Having said that, we liked the 4th floor room and the height gives some advantage for quiet and views of the neighborhood.

The lack of air con was upsetting- even in Feb the rooms were hot and we had to keep the balcony door open. The restaurant with views of the Acropolis was also disappointing. Especially in the evening when all you could see was your reflection in the windows. There’s much better views available elsewhere. The receptionist was lovely and ever so helpful. She talked us through a map of Athens circling all things of interest and directions to get there. Brilliant location with a lot within walking distance. The Acropoli metro station is a short walk away for things that are a longer distance to travel.\n",

I paid a little extra for an Acropolis view room on the 4th floor, and it was well worth it. What a view! The hotel has a superb location. Less than a five minute walk to the Acropolis Museum and the Plaka (cool, but somewhat loud, Tiki Bar directly next door as well). The rooftop bar was mellow when I was there, but again, what a view! I really have zero complaints about my stay at the Hera.\n",

We also booked through the hotel a private tour down the coast to Poisiden temple with a driver called Dennis which they use.  It was the best way to see this area, worth the money (which was not a bad price).  Lovely lunch by the water. All in all great experience and would do it again.\n",

The beds were very comfortable -- not rock hard like many European hotel beds. I asked for a blanket, rather than use the too-hot, ubiquitous duvet that was provided.  Along with a request to replace a burned-out bathroom light bulb, both needs were attended to promptly and cheerfully.  The bathroom fixtures are older in this deco-style hotel, but everything worked, and it was clean. The water was hot and the shower pressure was good.

It was, however, tiny (200 sq ft/5 sq metres I'd guess). Because of that - and the exaggerated Parthenon view - I'm not sure I'd recommend Hera. Although we were happy about our stay.\n",

The location is just a half block to the #1 rated attraction (Acropolis Museum), and Plaka shops. You can also pick up all three hop-on, hop-off buses one block away. Breakfast was very good. Two recommendations, if available, upgrade to a junior suite with Acropolis view from the balcony. Second, take the hotel arranged taxi service from the port or airport €25 & €45.

Excellent room amenities that many hotels that charge a lot more do not provide. Super comfortable bed, but be aware that a \"double bed\" may be just two singles pushed together. This is the only criticism I would have. Sufficiently fast internet, a balcony with a table and 2 chairs for gazing over the buildings and the acropolis in the distance. Nice restaurant and rooftop bar.  Very decent breakfast! Breakfast can be very, very boring at Greek hotels, but the Hera does a good job! Great location, 100 meters from the Acropolis museum and the underground station. Dozens of restaurants within a 2 minute walk and the Plaka area is 5 minutes away. The…\n",

Walking distance to everything you would need for a stop over in Athens. The rooms are of a 4star hotel standard with a delicous buffet  breakfast.

You are nicely set up to walk almost anywhere in Athens.  Our room had a nice view of the Acropolis (so pretty at night).  There's a cute, little restaurant on the top floor where you can grab a drink or have dinner with great views.  The staff at the front desk is SO helpful and can advise you on anything an everything in the city.  Love this place!\n",

Initially we were so tired from the long flight it was a wise choice to have allowed an extra day there. The rooms are small, but well furnished.  Comfortable clean beds and a nice view on the upper floors facing the street (front).  The breakfast buffet included foods we'd have at home with local sausages bread and fresh yogurt and fruit. The staff is friendly and helpful - even after we blew a fuse/circuit breaker with a power strip plugged into an adapter.  They also arranged a taxi to the airport both times we had to leave and made sure our second stay was at an upper floor with a balcony street view. The Roof Garden Restaurant was also amazing.

The receptionists were friendly and efficient. When checked in, we told them that we needed to depart earlier than their restaurant breakfast opening of 7 am, they sent within an hour prepacked breakfast to our room. When we returned from Mateora, we stayed in Hera Hotel again and enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the restaurant. The breakfast had limited choice but still good quality and with plenty of vegetable & fruits. Their standard rooms we stayed were well equipped but tight in space.

Easy to reach from the airport-good directions on the hotel website-just one change at Syntagma. Rooms clean,light and modern-even a kettle for Brits missing their Yorkshire tea! Small mini- fridge,efficient aircon; nice bathrooms; friendly & helpful staff.Dinner on the terrace is expensive but worth tretaing yourself.Recommended-we would stay again without hesitation.\n",

      "Review is :Sure, it's been said before but it bears repeating: Hera Hotel offers comfort, friendly staff, and attractive rooms but the overwhelming advantage is its location. Upon leaving the hotel, you are within a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis Museum (not to be missed!) and 2 minutes further to the Acropolis, itself. This means, of course, that you can be at those attractions at any time of day and avoid crowds should you choose. We were at the museum before 9 a.m. and had the place virtually to ourselves. Also, the hotel's proximity to the Plaka area is fortunate. There are plenty of interesting shops, cafés, and restaurants nearby.   We hail from a big city so we know the value in convenience and ease in a neighborhood for us as residents, and for our guests, and the Hera Hotel offers…\n",

It is close too to public transport (the metro, trams and bus) to allow for ease of movement around the city.  The hotel is charming, tastefully designed without being 'over the top'.  The rooms are comfortable though slightly small and are cleaned daily.  Our room, away from the street, was very quiet.  Breakfast was included in our tariff and well worth it with an excellent range of freshly prepared fruits, vegetable dishes and local cuisine (such as cheese pies).  The rooftop restaurant and bar, though pricey, is well worth at least one visit. The views of the Acropolis are spectacular.

There are hop on/hop off buses going past and the trainstation not even a 5 minute walk away. The hotel has pleasant staff and assisted with every query we had.

The Peacock was also a great starting point in the evening for a cocktail before heading out to dinner.  The rooms were well appointed and clean.  The staff were very helpful.  It has a small elevator typical of most European hotels.  The breakfast spread every morning had lots of hot and cold options to start your day.

Fantastic views of the illuminated Acropolis at night from the rooftop bar and restaurant. We stayed on the third floor and most times walked up and down the stairs rather than wait for the small slow elevator.

Staff were friendly and breakfast was good. The roof top bar overlooking the Acropolis was excellent for evening drinks and the food looked very good. Location is everything with the little time we had and from here we could walk to all of the top archeological sites with ease. Close to the Metro and a plethora of restaurants and bars. A great hotel for those on a whistle stop stay over.\n",

The hotel staff was fantastic and helped schedule a taxi service for my family the day we needed to get to the port for our Hydra excursion.  They even helped supply us with and extra outlet adaptor when we needed one for our entire stay!  They also guided us to a simple bakery just a block away (and off the beaten track) where we picked up inexpensive pastries each morning.  The little old man behind the Greek style bakery didn't speak any English, but we marveled at the expressions of pure joy when he saw we were pleased with what we bought, and with the price!\n",

We scored big by choosing this hotel as it’s in the PERFECT LOCATION and is close to all the shops, bars and restaurants, yet nestled just enough away from the loud noise very nearby.  Too, there is a nice gelateria, on the corner, selling myriad flavors that we sampled and gorged on every single day!!    We could actually see the Acropolis from our rooms!

The staff arranged for taxi pick-up from the airport to the hotel and drop off from the hotel to the pier when we left. Everyone we came in contact with at the hotel was genuinely pleasant and polite. The room was a bit on the small side and sadly did not have a view, but it was adequate for our pre-cruise endeavors.

      "Review is :Hera Hotel was absolutely wonderful. We stayed here twice while on our Greek vacation. The first time was as our first stop on our vacation. We had a small room. The room was great. It was of course quite small, with just enough room to walk around the (comfortable) bed. But it had everything we needed and was beautiful. Our second time at Hera was at the end of our vacation before our flight home. The staff upgraded us to a standard room. It was also beautiful, with a balcony to enjoy a morning cup of coffee.   Everything in the hotel was kept very clean and the staff were lovely. My husband's luggage was misplaced by the airline on our flight but the hotel made sure we had everything we needed in the meantime and they followed up with the airline for us until  it arrived.  We…\n",

      "Review is :The Hera is a quaint, exclusive (seeming) hotel steps from the Plaka, Athens' historical neighborhood situated at the base of the Acropolis. Large enough to carry a very nice rooftop restaurant but small enough for the personal touches, the Hera fit me and my curmudgeon to a T. Rooms are modern but elegant and the Hera had the best sheets and pillows out of our entire two week stay in Greece. Access has to be their biggest draw but I personally love the vintage aspects. Marble steps, club chairs, brass fittings all play in to the old world feel.\n",

We were close to everything that there is to see in Athens...the Acropolis, the Acropolis museum, Olympic stadium and a good size walking distance to the Louis Vuitton store. You have to say hello to our new friend Konstantine who is so courteous, helpful with local recommendations that were right on from the food to sightseeing. The front office team provided great recommendations which should be followed. Especially when they tell you to go on a tour or have a driver take you around the city and not rent a vehicle. Good advice :-). When you visit don't miss the rooftop bar because it has a beautiful view of the Acropolis.\n",

A small hotel that does have character and our room overlooked the Acropolis. Very clean, large comfortable king size bed and soft pillows. Yes, the rooms aren't big and maybe a little tired but this should not detract from the overall impression. We were on the 4th floor with the Acropolis view. Even though you did hear more street noise, just bring your earplugs it is still worth it. TIP if in the UK buy Boots Muffles Wax Earplugs, they are the best !   Excellent buffet breakfast with hot choices (thank you for looking after us so well Vasili), cocktails on the roof,  we just had the best time. Loved all the marble and brass…\n",

Only in Summer do the windows open so didn't try it as we prefer to have an outside feeling / outdoor seating. Staff are friendly and speak really good English, they are helpful in showing you what to visit, what areas to avoid and they provide you with plenty of brochures on things to do. The rooms are very pretty and a good size. The bathroom is a little cramped but has a great shower. It's hard not to have the bathroom floor overflowing when you shower though.

The room was spacious, well-equipped and had a stunning and large-sized terrace directly overlooking the Acropolis. As I was traveling for business, this was the ideal spot to get some work done in the afternoon.  The hotel's wifi was very fast and reliable - something I very much appreciate whenever I travel. Although the hotel is located at the heart of the touristic precinct surrounding the Acropolis where one could find plenty of restaurants, I decided to eat at the hotel's rooftop terrace.

There was good water pressure for the shower. There is small fridge with drinks and snacks but we didnt touch those. A bottle of water per person per day was complimentary.

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The only drawback from the point of a business trip was that I had to sit on my bed while working at the desk in the room. This minor inconvenience was offset by the staff finding me a small tube of toothpaste, since I managed to leave mine at home.  I had a lovely dinner at the terrace restaurant watching the sky darken and the lights illuminating the Acropolis come on. Magic. The quiet hotel is walking distance to the Acropolis and to the Acropolis metro station. My colleague was right - stay here if you visit Athens! I'll certainly be back.\n",

The room was also a good size- we didn't feel cramped at all compared to other European hotel rooms we've stayed in- and you could see the Acropolis lit up at night from our 3rd floor balcony. There are countless coffee shops right nearby, so we didn't feel the need to buy the hotel breakfast. For dinner, we loved Balcony and Manimani, both within a block or two of the hotel. They will also set you up with a car service from the airport for 45 euro.\n",

On the negative side, Bed Bugs was problem.  Changed rooms and floors night 2 of 5, the hotel did our laundry, dry cleaning, steam cleaned our luggage and refunded us.\n",

The roof top restaurant has good food but limited variety, it does come with a good view of the Parthenon and the Acropolis Museum. The breakfast buffet was satisfactory, but it could have been better. Standard rooms are small but modern, clean and well maintained. Ask for a front facing room, it comes with a nice balcony.\n",

Few negatives - one is the slow response of the only lift in the reception area. Wasted so much time here on every occasion we used it - a bit frustrating.  A very minor comment re. the breakfast - the toaster is pathetic - looked antiquated would not cost much to renew!!! Took ages to make a decent slice of toast!

      "Review is :This hotel was perfect for visiting the Acropolis and the museum. And not too far from the rest of the main attractions. There was also a metro station and a hop on-hop off bus stop close by. The hotel staff were wonderful. Breakfast was fine except for the lack of fresh fruit slices. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The bathrooms were a bit dark and needs an update but more than adequate. The shower was good. Take care eating in the restaurants in the nearby pedestrian street, some of them are very ordinary.\n",

Our room was very neat and had everything we needed, plus a balcony with 'that' view also. The restaurant served a great relaxed meal, with helpful suggestions from the waitress. We were surprised by the lovely wide breakfast room, with it's domed ceiling, and plentiful variety to choose from. The location was the winning factor. Just a short and interesting walk to the museum, Acropolis, great restaurants and shops. I would choose the Hera Hotel again.\n",

      "Review is :Close by Acropolis museum and walking distance of Syntagna square and Plaka. Comfortable beds.We read reviews saying that lower floor rooms were noisy so we requested a top floor room.Top floor rooms are only available as suites .We had a junior suite with balcony and Acropolis views ,however although the room has apparently 25 square metres floor area it feels like a decent room rather than a suite. I made a mistake in booking the original room for 136 € then upgrading at additional cost of 114 € ,I.e total €250.I should better have initially looked at hotel rooms in this price category.Average breakfast included.Stained carpets in common areas . Described as 'boutique' hotel but features a rather dated look.\n",

Hotel is very clean and tidy, whilst the rooms may be a bit small, well appointed and nearly ticked all our boxed for an excellent hotel. It is centrally located, a few minutes walk from the Acropolis, the Acropolis Museum, Hadrians Arch, Zeus temple etc. Five minutes to a great restaurant precinct, with lots of (tourist) shops and things to see. The Hop On Hop Off bus  stop no 4 is just around the corner which takes you on a great tour around Athens and you can get on/get off as often as you like over the term of your ticket. Must see the meat and fish markets together with the flea market area. Acropolis metro station is minutes away. Hotel provides a great breakfast including bacon & eggs! Dinner at the Peacock Bar Restaurant…\n",

Our rooms both stay were small but adequate. The AC worked well & the king-size bed was very comfortable. Our only complaint was with the bathroom in each. The tile in the shower/tub enclosures had a lot of black mold. Use of bleach-based spray by the cleaning staff would have easily prevented this. Our second room floor drain also backed up when we were showering, flooding the bathroom. Our dinner at the rooftop restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced. The view of the Acropolis was to die for. Beautiful breakfast room, with doomed glass ceiling and a garden setting. Very nice breakfast offerings.\n",

When I requested one I was told it wasn't possible because housekeeping had removed them. Apparently the baths get left on and cause flooding!! I'm an adult who knows how to turn a  tap off?

The staff were very helpful throughout our stay, the rooms comfortable ( though not that big) very large double bed, well appointed bathroom and for some, a small balcony. The neighbourhood is vibrant! - but that's part of the charm and the rooms are well sound proofed. Great breakfasts in a charming restaurant and plan a late evening visit to the roof top restaurant for a cocktail and to see the splendour of the Acropolis by night.

Rooms is a bit outdated but clean. We love the breakfast. Is all about the quality not quantity. We had a a few dinner on the roof top Peacock restaurant with a nice view to Acropolis and  food was delicious. Staff are friendly, helpful  and informative. No complaint. Highly recommended.\n",

Room we had was a standard double and it had a little balcony. It was comfortable, clean and spacious enough for 2 people.  Bathroom came with the shower and it was perfect for our stay.  Staff at the hotel are wonderful. They've been more than helpful from the moment we arrived and always happy to assist.   With such amazing location and wonderful staff and comfortable roomstay, we were surprised that it wasn't sold out.   Perfect stay if you wish to explore ancient sites.

We could easily hear one another through the connecting door but didn't mind as we were all one family; this might be problematic, however, if staying next to neighbors you don't know (and don't want to hear).  The rooms were on the smaller side, but functional with comfortable beds, very good air conditioning and good lighting. The hotel faces a relatively quiet street and the balcony doors were well-insulated, so traffic noise was never an issue. Bathrooms were small but, again, functional.

We needed a hotel that accommodates 3 adults for 2 nights prior to our cruise. This was one of the few that were available. The price of €175 per night was very reasonable which includes breakfast. The room was a bit small compared to U.S. hotels but it was adequate. The breakfast was good but it only opens at 7am. So if you're going on an organized tour with hotel pickup in the morning, your breakfast time might be a bit hurried. The hotel's location is excellent. Half a block from the Acropolis Museum and a 10 minute walk or less to Plaka restaurants.\n",

      "Review is :This hotel is located just blocks from the street up to the Acropolis, and all the restaurants and shopping near it, which was great.   However, in what seemed to be typical in Athens, the buildings around it were a little worn.  The hotel is older and while nice, somewhat reflects it's age.    The room was typical in Europe in that our \"King\" size bed was two singles pushed together.  The bathroom tub/shower is where you could see the age.  The air conditioning eventually cooled the room but it took longer than other places we have stayed.   The breakfast buffet was adequate.  Staff was very helpful throughout the hotel.  They helped raise our rating on the hotel.   A big positive on this hotel, besides the location, was its open air, roof top restaurant.  It has a great view…\n",

On the plus side, the Hera is a very pleasant and well-furnished hotel in a perfect location near the Acropolis Museum, Acropoli metro station and the southern end of the Plaka. There is a lovely rooftop bar/restaurant with excellent views and abundant eating options nearby.  However, my stay was marred somewhat on discovering (when I opened the door) that rather than a \"double\" room as requested, my partner and I had been allocated a room with two single beds pushed together (ie a \"twin\" room).

Room was quite small, but with a huge comfy bed.   Would definitely recommend to friends and family.\n",

The major benefit of staying here is the location, on the edge of the Plaka area, just minutes from the Acropolis Museum, entrance gate to the Acropolis itself and Acropoli metro station. The price was very good too compared to many other hotels in this sought after area. We booked a small standard room, an inferior room type compared to their standard rooms and rooms with Acropolis view but the room was fine for our needs. Yes it was very small but we knew what we were getting when we booked and  it still had all the comforts of the other room types, most notably a very comfortable bed which resulted in 3 excellent…\n",

Price very reasonable and the driver was on time, spoke English and we paid the hotel in advance, not the driver. Walking distance to the Plaka and all shopping.\n",

The location is just perfect, walking distance to the Acropolis, restaurants, bars, museum, and cobblestone roads lined with inviting shops.

Our first night we were only going to have a glass of wine, but after seeing the best view of the Acropolis, we ended up having dinner and great conversation with Fille as well as other guests.  You could not ask for a better view from a restaurant and the food was excellent.  This was a great location to all sites.  We walked every where.  It was also convenient to the metro and easy to find.  No need for an expensive taxi.  Would definitely recommend and stay again.\n",

Our room was on the top floor at the back of the hotel. The positive news was that it was quiet, but the view wasn't great (overlooking the hotel patioroof and walls of surrouding buildings). The room was clean but a bit small, bathroom the same. We didn't really need the airco in spring but we put it off anyway because of the noice it made. When staying here during summer this could be very annoying.  The rooftop terrace is great overlooking the city centre and the acropolis. We didn't dine here so we don't know the quality of the food and staff.  Restaurants are nearby in Plaka, a lot of them also with great views.  Breakfast was nice and refilled…\n",

We stayed in the Standard room (#204). It was a good and spacious room. But please avoid it if you're in Athens when you do not require in-room air conditioning. The noise of music from the restaurant below is loud and annoying. It did not bother us as the air-conditioning was louder than that noise. The staff at the hotel are very accommodating and polite. My wife has some very serious food allergies and the staff at the reception as well as restaurant went out of their way to accommodate every single request of ours with a genuine smile. What really stole our heart were two very rare and unique gestures…\n",

The location is easily within walking distance to the Acropolis, the Temple of Zeus, the Plaka (cobblestone streets of restaurants and shops), the Acropolis museum and pretty much anything you'd want to see in ancient Athens. As well as being only a block or so from the hop-on-hop off bus stops. The room was small, but clean and had a reasonably comfortable bed and pillows, as well as a safe in the closet, and a mini fridge. The tub did fill as we showered, but drained fairly quickly.  We were with two other couples and got to see the larger room with king bed. If you have a lot of luggage or plan to spend much time hanging…\n",

The closet was only deep enough to hold a couple of hangers parallel to the back wall, so I filled it up with the excess decorative pillows from the bed.

The hotel is also literally across the street from the new Acropolis Museum, a must see. The hotel itself is fine - a simple, quiet, small room hotel. The check in could have a been a bit friendlier, but the room was spotless, and quiet!!, with new linens and beds. Good simple bathroom with plenty of hot water. The best part is the rooftop, overlooking the beautifully lit Parthenon at night...lovely! Breakfast is fine, not outstanding.\n",

It does not offer an ornate or interesting lobby or breakfast room. The breakfast itself is passable; like most of our other hotels in Greece/Crete, it suffers from old-looking, overripe fruits and unimaginative breakfasts of fried eggs, scrambled eggs, little sausages and not-crispy bacon, a small selection of cheeses and edible breads.  What it does offer is a very welcoming, helpful and professional staff and a five-star location, just steps from the Akropolis, the Akropolis metro stop, the Akropolis Museum and the Plaka, a short walk to the Philapappou Hill, the Monastakeri, the Temple of Zeus and Hadrian’s…\n",

Very lovely little hotel within walking distance of everything you would want to see in Athens.  They upgraded us on the tail end of our journey and we had a nice balcony with an amazing view of the Acropolis.  Nice clean rooms, excellent staff, and rooftop restaurant with amazing views.  The only hotel we will ever stay at in Athens.\n",

My only complaint about the hotel is that the water was slow to drain from the shower. Which meant that as you showered the bathtub filled.   Keep in mind this is a boutique hotel, expect lots of charm, narrow hallways and tight rooms. However it was very comfortable and well located.\n",

You cannot beat the location being right by the Acropolis, the Plaka, and right off the metro.  We had a room with a balcony which we loved, nice view of the Acropolis.  The bedroom itself is tight--you had to move furniture to open the door to the balcony.  But the room and bathroom was very clean and nicely furnished.  The breakfast was great as well.  We went to the rooftop for drinks--amazing view from up there, though it is pricier than other places we went for dinner and drinks.  All in all, I would definitely recommend staying here with no hesitation.\n",

      "Review is :Hera Hotel is a great choice for staying in Athens.  It's in a great location; just a short walk to the Acropolis and the Plaka area.  It's a very safe area and very easy to get to.  The rooftop restaurant has a beautiful view of the Acropolis. It's very picturesque for a night time dinner.  The rooms are a decent size with comfortable beds. Certain rooms in the building face the Acropolis but unfortunately mine did not, as they were all sold out. The front desk staff is warm and inviting.  They do a great job giving directions and explaining key information about the area.  The hotel also provided a very good breakfast in the morning; buffet style.  I was very impressed with the selection.  All and all, I enjoyed my stay at Hotel Hera and would certainly love to stay there…\n",

I also found the area to be quite safe.  We stayed in the cheapest room available (economy room) and it was fine. The bathroom is spacious and modern, however for those staying longer, you may find the actual bedroom area a little small. The beds are also comfortable.  I went for a drink in the Peacock Restaurant upstairs, however found it a little pricey and the waiter seemed a bit pushy, seemingly wanting us to buy more. I preferred a nearby restaurant for dinner (see my other reviews).  All in all, highly recommended.\n",

We got in late after a long flight from SFO, we were greeted with smiles and instructions and information on the surrounding area.  Breakfast is extra at the hotel apparently (it was included with our avanti travel package), but it was delicious and staff was friendly. Rooms were a nice size, we had a king bed which was comfortable after 12 hours sitting upright on a plane. By far the location is what impressed us the most, it's walking distance to pretty much anything including the Plaka market, the Acropolis, Hadrian's gate, temple of Zeus. and the Acropolis museum. Overall great experience.\n",

You walk out and you are a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis and in the middle of all the Plaka shopping / dining.  The \"view\" however (and these are not unnecessary quotation marks) is not really much of a view.  Its sort of squint and lean to the right and you'll see something type of view (see photos).  Figuring that perhaps we got the wrong room, I went down to ask the front desk about it and was promptly told, \"just lean out a bit more and you'll see it\".

The hotel was quiet, but there is a bar or nightclub on the same street which had a lively, loud band playing on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, ending around 2 am. The breakfast is generous and I loved the rice pudding with cinnamon on top.  While we were on our two day tour away from the hotel, they stored our large bags so that we might travel lightly.\n",

In spite of giving the hotel my arrival time (early afternoon) weeks in advance, my room was not ready. When I finally moved in, it smelled badly of cleaning fluids. The problem was remedied later in the afternoon after I informed the front desk. As expected, the room was nicely furnished but on the very small side.

The breakfast was fine with bacon and egg etc, breads and cheese and cooked meats, cakes, yoghurt etc. Although the breakfast room is very nice it seems a great shame that breakfast is not served in the roof garden where there is a splendid view of the Acropolis.

First off, Athens is pretty large and consists of many different neighborhoods claiming to be the \"perfect\" location for travelers.  I will say without a doubt this hotel truly is the perfect location. It's about a 35-40 minute drive (at night) from the airport. Then, you are a 5 minute walking distance from the Acropolis Museum and the entrance to the Acropolis that arrives at Theatre of Dionysus first.  Also, you are about a 5 minute walk from Hadrian's Arch and the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Night time is great in the area and relatively safer that other neighborhoods feel.

Unfortunately the temperature of the room was always very warm, so we left the door open to the balcony to cool it down when we were there.

Best of all was the Peacock Restaurant with a most amazing view of the Acropolis, where wonderful Felli and her team, understood our distress soothed, wined and dined us and left us feeling all was not so bad after all. For all our stay we enjoyed the cocktails, food and wines of excellence but most of all the service which was exceptional. We can't wait to return. Thank you all very much.\n",

In fact for the price we paid we thought we were at the wrong hotel at first!! It is easily accessible by metro from the airport and is within walking distance of all the attractions, shops, restaurants etc. -  you can see the acropolis from the hotel -  On arrival the staff were helpful giving us free maps and useful information, our room was on the 3rd floor it looked over the back of the hotel so not a good view but we knew it was a cheaper room when we booked it. However the room was just right having everything you would need and a very comfy bed - one of the reasons for choosing this hotel was is has tea…\n",

Pros: - There is a good view of Parthenon from certain rooms but I could imagine you can get the same view from many other hotels in the area (Parthenon is up in the hill after all). - Location: I like the location of this hotel. Within walking distance of Arcopolis metro station and in the heart of most of historic sites. - There is a laundry right in the street next to hotel. So, if you're staying long and need to wash your cloth, you're in luck.  Cons: - Breakfast is sort of boring. They literally serve the very same menu every day and you would get bored after 2 days. Let a lone the fact that you would feel the left over food of previous days is re-served. That said, I would give a low rate to breakfast.\n",

The staff were incredibly helpful, especially in the Peacock Restaurant/Bar.  The rooms are pleasant, albeit a little bit tired. Be warned - although they have a bath and advertise having a bath, you can't actually take one because they don't supply plugs!

Parking is a little difficult, like with most of the Plaka, but there is a lot down the street which offers parking for 24 hours for 10 Euro if you are staying at the hotel.  It's only a couple of blocks off the main road, so you don't have to do a lot of driving on the crazy, narrow streets of the Plaka, which could justifiably make some drivers uncomfortable.

It's also 5 minutes walking from the plaka area and 10 -15 minutes from the main streets of the old town.  Moreover, the hotel is very close to some of the best restaurants in Athens. 5 minutes from  \"Bock Beer Restaurant\" and \" Indian Chef\". 10-15 minutes from \"Davinci Astisan Gelato-Quality Chocolate ( they got amazing waffles) and so on and so forth.

On the day we were meant to have late checkout which they wouldn't confirm until this point they told us they could not help us. We then had to relocate to another hotel paying a full nights accommodation when we only needed the room for a few hours. We were very annoyed at the lack of help from the hotel.

The rooms are fine and economic price-wise and the hotel is located in an estuarine street section in the Macriyanni area. It is a fine restaurant-less (and that is an advantage, though there are banqueting facilities) boutique hotel  and possible top for the particular area. Neighborhood ambience in the historic (not in the throbbing tourist heart though).  Congratulations Mr. Khadjillia for the fine renovation and your eloquent perseverance.\n",

I stayed here my first night in Athens and picked the hotel and my room for the view of the Acropolis: it did not disappoint! The room was beautiful--clean, modern furniture; strong wifi; lovely herbally-scented amenities, and a nice selection of teas and coffee. But the highlight was the huge patio with a breathtaking view of the Acropolis--I literally ditched all sightseeing plans and just hung out on my balcony, sipping tea and watching the Acropolis in the changing light of the late afternoon, the evening and night. And then I got up at 5am to see the artificial lighting on the Acropolis flicker off as the sun started to come up. If budget allows, I would…\n",

The staff at the bar/restaurant upstairs were my favorite part of the stay.  The location is fabulous, the view from the restaurant is superb, the staff is very friendly and helpful with everything.  The room was small, you had to wait your turn to move about but well worth the money.\n",

      "Review is :We again stayed at the Hera for four nights at the beginning of October 2014.  In my opinion, you cannot beat this hotel for location, the breakfast, the price, and the friendly, helpful English-speaking staff.   In addition, there are only 38 rooms, it has a restaurant/bar on the roof with a nice view of the Parthenon (not open during the day), the air conditioning works great, and it has very nice bathrooms.  There is also an available computer and printer in the conference room.  Restaurant tips: If you would like an incredible Acropolis view, great food at reasonable prices, check out the Strofi Tavern for dinner or lunch on the patio...reservations for dinner are essential.  Just walk up to the first street Haztichristou and turn left...you will pass the Herodion Hotel and…\n",

Then it was only a 5 minute walk to the hotel  The only confusion was which way to turn to find the hotel since the streets aren't marked well.  The hotel is lovely with very friendly service.  The patios were perfect for enjoying wine and viewing the acropolis.  The restaurant might have been a little overpriced with amateur service but the view almost compensated.  Since it is literally across the street from the Acropolis, we visited the museum right after arrival.

The hotel was well located in the city about a 10 minute walk to the foot of the Acropolis and a 20 minute walk to nearly 100 restaurants. Also a subway station 1 block away from the hotel. Free WiFi in the room that worked reliably. We had the buffet breakfast in the hotel dining room every morning and was quite happy with it. We had drinks one evening at the rooftop bar and it had incredible views of the Parthenon. The staff at this bar were very friendly and suggested many nice Greek liqueurs which we really liked.   Unfortunately we had some items stolen out of our luggage while at the hotel. I dealt with the hotel manager Ms. Chatzilia on the issue and she was able to deal with the situation to my satisfaction.\n",

I had read comments about small rooms and a cramped elevator but, even traveling with what compared to others we saw I believe were some relatively large bags (18 days worth of stuff after all) we found the spaces to be very comfortable.

We booked a standard Acropolis view and it definitely delivered with a good view from the small balcony. The location is very good for accessing the Acropolis and the Acropolis museum. You can walk through to the Plaka area in a few  minutes. If you want to explore further afield there is a Metro station just up the road. Hotel staff can also arrange bookings for open top tourist buses that circulate on a regular basis to main tourist sites. Excellent breakfast served in the lovely restaurant space downstairs.

The room was a bit worn, and although we had a lovely tub - no plug for it, so the shower was all you could use.

There was a dynamic duo working- they were there every night and were providing great service and making friends with all the guests.

I had reserved two standard rooms, one with a queen and one with two twins.  The desk manager had no explanation for his inability to find the reservation (ultimately we were told that there is a general lack of communication between the reservations department and the front desk), but said he would put us in two equivalent rooms just not on the same floor, and that we would change to the same floor the next day.

We were a bit disappointed in the view, however, after paying extra for it, because what you actually see from the room is the ugly apartment buildings across the street. You have to go onto the balcony or into the far left corner of the room in order to see the Acropolis, and even then the view isn't that great. (We had the last room on the right on the 4th floor -or 5th floor in US terminology- this is the farthest from the Acropolis of the 4 rooms that are billed as \"Acropolis view,\" so perhaps the others may be better.)

Mind: There's only 4 rooms at a somewhat higher rate that offer Acropolis view and they are on the 4th floor. Lower floor standard rooms at the front of the hotel look out on the hustle and bustle of the streets and have a small balcony. However if you order a 'standard room' - unspecified - like us, you may find yourself put away somewhere in a room with a balcony rail over the inner court and have to be content with air conditioner noises and in my view:  'no view!'.

The rooms were typically small but with nice amenities in the bath and very comfortable beds and linens.

Rooms are on the small side, but more than adequate. We are in the restaurant both evenings...excellent, diligent but well paced service,  wonderful views, good choice of food. Breakfast more than adequate. Room very peaceful. We will recommend to friends\n",

      "Review is :This hotel was more than we could ask for for 5 nights in March. The hotel itself was beautiful! The lobby, the breakfast room, the roof top restaurant was beautiful. The front desk staff was wonderful. We wanted the true Athens experience and they gave us exactly what we wanted. We didn't go out to eat once without asking for several suggestions so we could have some local input. Every single restaurant they suggested was delicious and we are HUGE foodies! My husband and I wanted to visit a Greek island but didn't know exactly how to go about it and the front desk set everything up, told us exactly where to go and we ended up visiting the Island of Aegina, the closest island to Athens and very affordable but gave us the island experience we were looking for.

Rooms are modestly sized by nicely and thoughtfully furnished.  The restaurant food and service are great (although when we were there in January it was understandably quiet).  Pay the extra for the Acropolis view, which is at its best at night.  Hera Hotel is also only a few yards away from Mani Mani (MANH MANH) restaurant which is a real treat.\n",

Service at the front desk is good, breakfast is OK...rooms are very small but nice.  Elevator moves at speed of a glacier...take stairs if you don't have bags.   Wifi is faster than most places in the USA...very good!  What is surprising in the very shadow of the Acropolis is how few restaurants or shops there are.  You have to go toward Sygmanta Square to find the restaurant district.\n",

      "Review is :It was definitely worth paying a bit extra to have a room which overlooked the Parthenon.  All attractions are within easy walking distance of this hotel, as are plenty of eating places.  Although, having said that, the views over the Acropolis from the hotel's roof top restaurant at night are spectacular and the food was plentiful and well-presented.  We didn't arrive until after 9 pm and were still able to have a freshly-cooked meal.  Breakfast was slightly disappointing - why do chefs insist on keeping scrambled eggs under silver domes so that water drips back onto them?!  There was plenty of fresh bread and a good selection of cereals.  The room was very clean and had two chairs, a particular fad of ours, as so often in other hotels, one of us has to sit on the bed to read…\n",

Went to the restaurant at the top of the hotel the night I checked in, and was made to feel quite welcome by the best waiter...(also had some of the best grilled squid I've ever had!) The Manager and the rest of the front desk staff helped me plan my days, and always had recommendations on best times, locations, etc. It is a family owned hotel, and it feels like it.

We opted for the Acropolis view room for a little extra and did enjoy a few drinks on our small patio, and people watched later in the evening. As for location, turn right leaving the hotel and you walk into many cafe's of Plaka and tourist shops and bars. Walk around the neibourhood and get lost all you want, as the Acropolis is always above to guide you home. The metro is a 5 minute walk away, and the main area to visit in Athens is walkable for sure. As for the hotel itself, the staff were friendly and always willing to help.

Pros:  nice exterior, convenient to Acropolis metro stop and Acropolis, Plaka, nice lobby and breakfast room.  Con:  The bathroom shower tile and the sliding glass frame were dirty looking.  I mentioned to the staff and was offered another room.  I looked at it and that shower was almost as bad.  Management offered a view of the Acropolis room but we declined because my husband didn't want to bother to move.  They indicated it was the silicone used around the shower--whatever--it wasn't appealing.  We didn't shower and were there one night only.  I suspect with the economy being as it is they don't have the money to refurbish.  I did resent that we paid $180 something for that…\n",

The staff worked extremely hard to make sure that we were satisfied at all times. They all spoke excellent English and helped direct us on our walking trips each day.  Prior to our visit, I requested Hera to arrange a taxi to meet us at the airport.  The driver, George Koufopoulos, was waiting with a sign.  He drove us to and from our ship as well.

This was very convenient, and I highly recommend for this reason.  Other highlights: - Rooftop restaurant offers great view of Acropolis. The food is decent, albeit a little overpriced. Also, not crowded like some of the other rooftop restaurant/bars. - Nice bathroom. Shower had good water pressure.  The room is pretty good by European standards, especially the bathroom. We'd stay here again. The breakfast was not bad.\n",

Hotel Hera is literally within spitting distance of Plaka, the Acropolis, the Acropolis Metro station, and offers some decent dining choices (including its own rooftop bar and restaurant) within spitting distance.  However, if you are looking for great service, comfortable accomodations, and friendly staff, you would be better to look elsewhere, as this hotel doesn't warrant its alleged 4 star rating.

Excellent view of the Acropolis from our room, and even better from the rooftop restaurant/bar. Be warned that the rooms are small, and even the \"junior suite\" which should have been easily big enough for 3 adults, really wasn't. The advertised king-sized bed was at most a queen-sized bed, there was no chair for the desk at which one needed to sit to do the (slow) internet, and because of a drainage problem, the bathtub didn't work, only the shower.

The hotel staff is always available and exceeded our expectations. Truly enjoyed the Western aspect of service for once while in Europe, it make our stay in Athens a very pleasant and memorable.

      "Review is :Second time at Hera hotel but dissapointed this time.  Choose this hotel in the first place cause of good reviews, close to center and the free parking space. On the first stay at Hera we had a small budget room for one night stay, which was on the back of the hotel with no balcony. The room was too small for a couple, but our stay was only for one night so that didnt bother us. The room was clean, had a big double bed with one cover (which in most hotels is two single beds together with two single covers), it was quiet and had a great sleep. We had no time for breakfast first time so our stay was perfect.  Second time at Hera booked the standard double room in order to have more space than previous time. Our stay was again for one night. Was given a room at the front of the…\n",

      "Review is :Have stayed here several times now on visits to Athens and am not disappointed.  The location is close to the Plaka and the new Acropolis Museum and is a short walk to several bars and restaurants.   The Acropolis underground station is a five minute walk away and this can take you anywhere in Athens or to the airport.  The staff are very welcoming and helpful and although the rooms are not big they are kept very clean with fresh linen several times a week.  Breakfast is a buffet style with a reasonable choice of breads, jams, hams, chees, and hot selection of eggs, bacon etc.  There is also a restaurant on the top floor with views over to the Acropolis.   The style and location of the hotel is probably more suited to adults rather than families with young children.\n",

I was very anry with my husband for choosing this hotel initially. However, since we had pre-paid it, we had to stay eventually.

Other walkign distance highlights include Hadrian's Arch and Temple of Zeus (10 minutes).   The rooms were small - just like most European hotel rooms - but clean and definitely served its purpose.

Haven't stayed at the hotel though but from the looks of it I will be recommending it to my visiting friends to Athens. The roof garden restaurant had among the most spectacular view of the Acropolis. The service was outstanding and the food was good (linguini with shrimps). An excellent place.

First, it is within an easy walk of the Acropolis, the fabulous Acropolis Museum, the Plaka, Metro stations, and many other attractions. Our room was a good size and very comfortable.  The included breakfast was delicious and served in a very pleasant space.  The front desk folks were very friendly and always helpful.  My only criticism is that if you have the front desk order a taxi for you, the price of the taxi for some reason gets inflated beyond what the taxi meter and the guidebooks advise.\n",

As soon as we entered the hotel, we were impressed of the classical line in decoration and the sense of luxury we felt. Very neat and nice spaces compose the whole picture of the hotel.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  Our room was beautifully decorated, with cozy spaces, a nice terrace and a very aesthetic bathroom. Our favorite place was the dining area at the roof garden restaurant, where the very tasty meals were accompanied by the wonderful view of Acropolis, which captures your eyes especially when illuminated at night!!!

We didn't care about Syntagma Square much (it's just a square) which is about a 10 minute walk away.

We had a view of the Parthenon from our balcony.  Wifi not so hot in the room, but worked well in the breakfast room and lobby.  We were in a junior suite for 3 of us.  It is not really a suite, just a larger room with a love seat that folds out as a bed.   I think that for 3, this suite is the only workable solution- a double room with a roll-away would be cramped.  Overall, this hotel was a great.  The breakfast was good, the restaurant on the roof has a great view of the Acropolis, and the location is perfect.  We would certainly stay at the Hera again.\n",

The hotel was in a great location, you could walk right out the door to some cute little restaraunts. Their rooftop restaraunt was fantastic and showcased a beautiful view of the Acropolis. Their breakfast was good and the concierge was very helpful in suggesting activities and places to eat.   We returned to Hera on our way home for a one night stay and were suprised by an upgraded room with balcony and view of the Acropolis! There was a basket of fruit and bottle of wine, totally unexpected. I'm not sure if they were thanking us for staying a second time, congratulating us on our marriage or just being nice but it was the perfect ending to our wonderful trip! Loved this hotel.\n",

      "Review is :My partner and I have just returned from a long weekend in Athens, staying at the Hera hotel. The reception and restaurant staff were very friendly and accomodating, and the room, although not massive was comfortable and well furnished. The location of the hotel, approximately 100 metres from the Acropolis Metro station, and a similar distance from the Acropolis museum, was perfect for sightseeing, and grabbing a bit of 'Greek culture'! There were also plenty of little cafe bars/tavernas on the doorstep of the Hera, so you are never far away from food and drink. We ate in the hotel rooftop restaurant on one evening of our stay, and the food was very good quality. We would definitely use the Hera again if we return to Athens.\n",

We arrived late the first night and were given a room with a double bed and although the room didn't smell like smoke, there was an ashtray sitting on the desk. When I said that I had requested two twin beds and a nonsmoking room, I was told that they did not get the request, it was not noted on my reservation.  The hotel was fully booked so the first night my friend and I had to share a double bed.  Not an ideal situation.  We were moved the next morning to a room with two twin beds.  The room was fine but we did notice that it had a musty smell.  I suppose we should have complained but we just opened the door to the…\n",

The location is absolutely perfect 10 minutes from Acropolis and so close to other attractions, shops and bars.

Only area for improvement was the food in the restaurant, wasn't bad, but wasn't great.

My husband and I booked a 'special rate/non-refundable' rate, because from the reviews we read and the hotel's website, it appeared to be nice and a good deal...we were sadly mistaken.  I'll begin with the good.  First, it's pretty centrally located in the Plaka neighborhood of Athens which is full of tourist shops, restaurants, little cafes, and steps from the Acropolis and Syntagna Square.  Second, it has great access to the subway system (which is very easy to understand and use).  Last, the food at the hotel was actually halfway decent.  One night we ordered late night appetizers for room service and the food was hot and fresh.    Now for the not-so-great aspects.  Like I said, we booked a 'special…\n",

Our balcony off the room had a great view of the Parthenon and was very pretty at night.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, as we had to unexpectedly stay another night when our flight out of Athens was cancelled due to strikes.

I chose the Hera Hotel based on the good reviews I had read when I was planning my trip and because of its great location – the hotel is within easy walking distance of the Acropolis, the New Acropolis Museum, and the Plaka.  A few months before my departure, however, I noticed a number of negative reviews and became concerned about whether I had made the right choice.  Notwithstanding my misgivings, I decided to stick with the Hera, primarily because of its proximity to the Acropolis and, in particular, the New Acropolis Museum, which I was very eager to visit.  As things turned out, I’m extremely glad I chose the Hera; it’s a great hotel and its location is ideal…\n",

The rooftop restaurant was a standout. The food was delicious and the view is good, although the prices are high. Our room was clean but definitely well-worn. I thought the room price was high for what you get, but it seems all the hotels in Athens are pricey.\n",

      "Review is :Stayed at Hera in early April 2011. Loved the design: spacious bathroom, large comfy bed (on the firm side though), all amenities in the room incl kettle, tea / coffee; high-speed internet free of charge. Breakfast could’ve been slightly better as it seemed to lack variety and was a bit short on fruit. I got the small standard room though I had booked a normal one – make sure it doesn’t happen to you if you’re travelling as a couple as the room barely has any space to move around.  The receptionist was very helpful and arranged for a normal standard room for the second part of my stay. The hotel’s billing policy was definitely weird. Although I had deliberately booked a post-paid rate, the hotel debited the full amount of the reservation BEFORE I checked in. Actually, just as I…\n",

They must have hired a really great photographer for the website to make it look so grand and pretty. Didn't compare to other 4 or 5 star hotels in service either (if you need toothpaste or something you need to go down to the lobby), but depends what you're going for- definitely not the most romantic place. Made me wish I splurged on the Starwood properties in the area.\n",

We used Taxi George for all our transfers and 1/2 day Mercedes limo sighseeing in Athens. Always on time, you pay more but you get more. Restaurant Mani Mani 2 minutes from hotel was amazing as was the rooftop restaurant at the hotel. Breakfast at hotel is bountiful and plenty to start your day. Rooms are small but typical for European cities, bathrooms very very, very nice. we had Acropolis view which was a plus. Overall a perfect choice and value in Athens.

The rooms were clean and everything inside the Room was nice. Internet access etc.  We loved the food at this Hotel as well.  And the LOCATION- the best for us. you can walk anywhere. And loved it!! even the bus stop was close. so location-wise, for us was perfect.  I will definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers. I have A big issue around hotels, and I don't stay in just any place normally... MAYBE not the best place for a honeymoon couple.. because they don't do anything special when you arrive or champagne in the room etc. But we didn't care about stuff like that actually..\n",

I have to admit that our stay in Hera Hotel exceeded our expectations and was excellent in every single way. The staff (incl. the Manager of the Hotel who tried personally to make as feel at home and as comfortable as possible) was super kind and helpful. The location was amazing (next to the Acropolis museum and the historic center). The views of the Acropolis from our room and the roof garden were breathtaking. The rooms were very clean and the whole decoration was very classy. Overall I have to say it is one of the best value for money hotels I have ever stayed in.   Thanks again for a wonderful stay.

The desk was manned on arrival but the hotel was very hot and the lift had seen better days.  The working girl on the corner did not impress my wife ... :) Our \"suite\" was smaller than we expected - and as you are after a long late flight - we saw the faults rather than the benefits.

It’s about a 20-30 minute walk to Syntagma square, You can walk to Syntagma square through Plaka.  There’s a train station nearby as well so you can easily catch a train to Syntagma square and to the airport as well. It’s probably a lot faster to catch the train to the airport than by car.  It's a fairly clean botique hotel, breakfast was not too great. The first room that we got was fairly clean, but when we came back from our trip to Santorini, they gave us a different room and the ceiling was mouldy!  I'm very finicky when it comes to accommodation and things like that will give me the cringe. We didn’t bother changing rooms as we only needed to stay there for 1 night.\n",

People had told us not to stay in Athens because it didn't offer much - we're not really into the museum thing but loved the range of activities (shopping, restaurants, jewellery, sights and friendly locals) and my wife now has a new found appreciation for all things archeological.  We'd both…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the Hera Hotel for 5 nights. The location was within walking distance of the Acropolis, Agora, Plaka, Temple of Zeus, and the Acropolis metro station. We had the 5th floor room with view of the Acropolis, which was beautiful, especially lighted up at night. There was a balcony where you can sit and admire the view. Room was clean and well decorated. Breakfast was good. There were many restaurants/shops in the Plaka, a 10 minutes walk. Be careful of pick pockets on the Acropolis. Make sure your wallet/money is well secured. My wallet was taken within the first hour of our visit there, which put a damper on the start of our trip. We used George the Taxidriver to Sounion, Delphi, and Corinth/Mycenae for a private tour. The taxi service was excellent.\n",

      "Review is :My friend and I stayed at Hera Hotel from 6/17/10 through 6/20/10 and greatly enjoyed our stay.  It's a quick 5-minute walk to Plaka, the main tourist area with many shops and restaurants, and about a 10-minute walk to the Acropolis.    As two female travelers, we felt VERY safe in this hotel (as an aside, we did not feel very safe in Athens itself, and we're used to city living).  The room was small, but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway.  Although I agree with other posters that the hallways are a little stuffy, the air conditioning in our room worked wonderfully.  We also had a nice cocktail upstairs at the Peacock Lounge, which overlooks the Parthenon.  If I had to go back to Athens, I would definitely stay at Hera Hotel.\n",

Plaka is a great place to do some local shopping and also has choice of good greek taverns or restaurants. The hotel is a nice compact hotel with largely self service options. Checkin was a breeze. Rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. Breakfast is pretty good. Staff is pretty accomodating. From the hotel, you can walk down to the parliament square which is 15-20 mins walk.

The hotel itself was very clean, the room was perfectly adequate and the bed, although a little hard offered a surprisingly good night's sleep. We had a glimpse of the Acropolis, but I wouldn't have been upset if we hadn't, as you get to see this aplenty when you're out and about, especially at night.  The only constructive criticism I have is 1) perhaps Greeks in the tourist district are a little jaded, but it's always nice for guests to be acknowledged at reception - even just a 'hello' 2) it's OK to think laterally - no-one we talked to seemed to have any…\n",

The reception was more than welcoming, friendly, professional and willing to assist in any way, which presupposes the management pays special attention in this respect (not always the case in Athens' hotels, I' m afraid). Bravo!  The hotel itself and the rooms reflect low-profile luxury, giving it a 5* flair. Breakfast buffet was rich with great variety and tastes!

There really is no balcony that you can sit on, the view was only from one corner. Don't spend the extra money, you will see the Acropolis from every location in Athens.  The breakfast room and food was very good. The roof top restaurant which has a very great view of the Acropolis is very nice. The food was excellent, the service great and it was not overpriced.

And certainly the room price, (135 euros for a double with breakfast/ per night) is overpriced.  Also the services are not of a 4 star hotel.  The view to acropolis it is also a question.

      "Review is :Hotel Hera is a great place to stay in Athens.  We found it superior in price and location to many other alternatives we considered.  We used it as the meeting point for several people in our group after flying into Athens for a cruise that left there the next day.  The location can't be beat: there are a myriad of dining and shopping options within walking distance.  Even if you don't eat dinner at the hotel, the rooftop bar/grill is a must-see because of the views of the Acropolis.  We met up there for drinks the night we arrived as the backdrop was breathtaking.  As other reviews noted, the rooms are not huge but they are standard for a typical European hotel and were more than sufficient even with several pieces of luggage.  The beds were also quite firm, however it did not…\n",

The hotel was nice, the rooms were clean, but very small (and we even had a deluxe room with a Acropolis view). The view from the balcony is only of the Parthenon.  The only complaint I have is that the staff was a bit apathetic. Don't go here if you are expecting a good concierge type service for recommendations and such.  You could tell the front desk folks didn't have a vested interest in the success of the hotel and that they were just there for a paycheck.  I had to get dinner recommendations from a pharmacy, because they were actually friendly and wanting to help. The front desk just did not seem approachable and were understaffed.

If you ask at reception, they will give you a lead to plug in your laptop in your room at no extra charge.  Fantastic, especially as I had been charged EURO19 per day at the NJV the night before. The room was very clean but very small.  Room (just about) for a bed, side table and desk and a chair.  Bathroom again, small but clean. Breakfast was not great.

We stayed at the Hera twice: once at the beginning of our trip, and another after our return from Mykonos and Santorini.

First of all it has a wonderful location, so close to Acropolis and also to Acropolis metro station. I liked how it looked like from front-side and it was even well visible from the top of Acropolis. I reserved a normal single room and I was so nicely surprised that my room on the 3 rd floor had a view of Acropolis. I also liked the free Internet connection in my room and tea/coffee facility. I could only complain for the air-conditioning system, which was not working good and it was quite warm in my room. However if I am again going to Athens, no doubt I would also choose that hotel, as I really liked it very much.\n",

From the Akropoli Metro station to the hotel is a short walk to the south, the Plaka a short walk to the north and the Acropolis a short walk to the northwest.  You can pick up the Tram to Glyfada in front of Syntagma to the north or the Fix station to the south. 2. Although the room was on the small side (I was in Room 103) it was very comfortable and clean.  The air conditioning and television worked well and the water remained hot.  The bed was firm.

      "Review is :In 2006 my wife, teenage son and I had planned on a trip to Greece and we were to stay at the Ava Hotel.  Foot surgery for my son cancelled those plans.  When I contacted the Ava for our trip in '08, they had raised the price of their executive apartment (separate bedroom and living room with sofa sleeper) to 255 euros, which I though was way too much.  So after many hours of searching for Athens hotels, I found three or four near the Acropolis that had connecting rooms, and I finally chose the Hera. We had rooms 101 and 102, and it really worked out well.  My son had his own room and bathroom.  The rooms, I must say, are quite small, so if it is just one or two of you, you may not like it, but the connecting rooms worked fine for us.  The bathrooms are nice, and thank goodness,…\n",

Although bathroom was small with limited counter space, the shower worked very well. Good housekeeping service!  Cons: Staff was not at all weloming or friendly (with exception of the rooftop staff).  There were no greetings, and no concierge help. There was such a smell of smoke throughout the hotel, that on the 2nd night we put a towel at the base of our door to help with the smell.  I think it was so much stronger because they keep the hallways with no inside or outside air, everything is very stagnant. Do not be fooled by Jr. Suite status, not much bigger than a large closet when the pull-out bed is pulled out.  Expect the bed to be brick…\n",

We stayed three nights and would highly recommend the hotel, especially for its value for money location.  It is within walking distance of all the major sites and the metro is a stoe's throw away from the front door.  We did not eat in house but the roof terrace, where the restaurant is located, has excellet views of the Akropolis and its surrounds.  Breakfast was also very good.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed for 4 nights in May.  The location is excellent, you can walk to the Acropolis, the Plaka and pretty much most of the other tourist areas.  The metro is within a few minutes walk from the hotel.  It is pretty easy to take the metro from the airport to the hotel.  We did take a taxi from the airport to the hotel, but just a warning to tourists, our taxi driver ripped us off by charging too much!!!  If you arrive during regular hours, I would definitely take the metro which is only 6 euro.  We booked through bookings.com which was a better rate that what the hotel was offering.  The only problem we had was on our last night, the hotel did not have hot water and it could not be fixed for several hours.\n",

We paid for an 'Acropolis view' - I'm not sure I would bother again since really all it meant was that you were higher up in the building - you had to be out on the balcony to see it and there are cranes in the way - not the hotel's fault but not worth the extra.   Athens is a seriously noisy city and the roadworks right outside the hotel didn't help, however this was only a problem because we had to open the windows to cool down at night  - they don't have the aircon on in March.

You must at the very least have a drink here in the early evening.  When we arrived, the manager assured us that we 'had the best room in the hotel' and he was right.  We were on the top floor and our balcony looked out to the wondrous Acropolis.  The room was a little bit cramped for 'a superior room' but the balcony made up for that, and, most important, it was very quiet up there.  The hotel has a very pleasant breakfast room and the food was acceptable too.  Only a short walk away is the Plaka district, which is full of interesting bars and restaurants.

It was literally steps from the metro station and 5 minutes walking to the entrance of the Acropolis and the Plaka District.  We booked this hotel based on reading the reviews here.  It's certainly very convenient!  Well worth the not too pricey rate!  The hotel is well kept. The room was definitely small compared to U.S. standards, but probably average in Europe.  We had a room facing the street and noise wasn't a problem.  The rooftop restaurant had the most amazing view of the Acropolis.

      "Review is :This is worth the long reading if you have any intention of reserving a room here. Prior to reserving the Hera in Athens for Sept 21-24 I read my reviews on Trip Advisor as I always do and was satisfied to book three nights with the so called Acropolis view room for $150 Euros per night. Management must have changed since those reviews so read on. Prior to departing from the states I inquired about shuttle service from the airport and was advised a cab would be $20 Euros. It was double.  We usually use public transit as much as possible during our travels and were aware of the new airport metro transit service but we were tired after two weeks of touring and just wanted to get to our room.  What an experience as the cab driver made his own lane the whole way and nearly clipped…\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is nice (brand new and clean rooms) and the location is good (close to Acropolis, Plaka, and other major attractions, and it is a quiet street). Staff is courteous and very professional (international style: 'Greek flavor' is missing).  But I was a bit disappointed when I got my room there. I had reserved a room on a major travel website that said \"Superior double room queen sized bed with Acropolis view\", for 160 euros.  The room was nice, with luxury furniture, thick carpet and a green marble bathroom, but it was a bit small (once they put a queen size bed inside, there is little room left...).  More disappointing was the lack of Acropolis view from the room's balcony. Indeed only the two upper floors have a view on the Acropolis. Below, the only thing you see is the…\n",

      "Review is :Like many hotels in Athens, Hotel Hera was renovated for the 2004 Olympic games. They did an excellent job. For about $140 (US) a night, we got a hotel that appears brand new. The rooms are spotless, slightly bigger than the average Euro room and feature king-sized beds if you want one. The decor is beautiful and the bathrooms are roomy with marble all over. There's a rooftop bar that offers a great view of the Acropolis and a nice taverna that offers a complimentary full breakfast. The best thing about the hotel, however, might be the location. Not only are the Plaka and the Acropolis within walking distance, but the Akropoli Metro station is literally a two minute walk. We would stay there again without hesitation.\n",

      "Review is :What a  nice surprise the Hotel Hera was.  My cousin who lives in Athens suggested that we stay there.  She knew it had been remodeled for the Olympics and that it was the first venture into the hotel business for the owners.  The people at the desk couldn't have been more pleasant.  We arrived at 1:00 am due to plane delays and they were waiting for us with open arms.  We had two double connecting rooms because we have two children and they were able to accomodate this.  As you may well know, many european hotels do not have connecting rooms.  Although the rooms were very small, we did have a nice view of the Acropolis.  A room with a view is not necessary here because the rooftop restaurant has a lovely view as well.  We had booked a cruise with an early morning departure and…\n",

      "Review is :The Hotel Hera is newly renovated (June 2004) and is an extremely modern hotel.  We stayed in room 502 which had a private balcony with a view of the Parthenon on the Acropolis.  The hotel was comfortable, clean, and away from the hub-bub and noise of the main tourist spots of Athens.  That is not to say that the Hera is in a bad location.  It is in a great location, just 150 yds from the Akropoli Metro Stop and within walking distance of all the major sites.  It is just that the Hera is in residential area vice your typical touristy area.  The included breakfast was outstanding with a mixture of European and American items to choose from.  The breakfast staff was extremely accommodating and brought out special request items like Nutella.  My kids love Nutella.  Our favorite…\n",

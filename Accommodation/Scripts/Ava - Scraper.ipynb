But enough about the location.  The best thing about AVA Hotel is the hotel itself.  The hotel is fantastic!  I’ve traveled around the world and this hotel ranks up with the best.  Don’t expect a big name brand hotel when a guest is only a number.  No on-site health club, gift shops etc.  The staff here really care! The Executive Suite is huge and super clean.  In fact the whole hotel is spotless!  Nice shower, bedroom and living area.  What really makes this hotel special is the staff!  Everyone is very attentive and friendly.  They are always willing to help and offer suggestions for dining, coffee and site seeing.  We loved sitting and having good conversations with them.  You can tell that they really enjoy what they are doing!  I highly recommend AVA hotel Athens.…\n",

I was hesitant because I thought the Intercontinental (which turned out to be located in a soulless area) would be better choice. I could not be more wrong. The location in Plaka is amazing, convenient for transportation, and in the center of things. We chose a room with a view, large balcony with view of Acropolis. The room was lovely with living area, kitchen, and did I mention the balcony? Breakfast was ample and fit our needs. But the true stars of this place are the staff who are unfailingly pleasant and helpful in making arrangements, reservations, and navigating a new city. I cannot say enough complimentary things about them, especially Vassia, who takes hospitality to a new level. I loved this place so much I would not hesitate to book this hotel on returning to Athens. …\n",

It is small, Boutique style and wonderful.  Close the EVERYTHING...walking distance to the Akropolis, Museums, Monastiraki, Plaka, Syntagma Square and all the Ruins within the city. They have beautiful and spacious rooms. The staff are AMAZING!! They all speak English very well and are happy to guide and recommend tons of things to do! Our room (301) had a large exterior balcony, sitting area with the back view of the Akropolis.  STUNNING!! You literally walkout of the hotel and you are immersed in shopping, dining, smells of yummy food, buzzy neighborhood, great little bars and wonderful people. Yes, I SHOPPED, A LOT!! The hotel had a storage room to hold items if you need to check out and still be out and about before your flight! What a great place to be! I will definitely be coming back and will only stay at the AVA hotel. See you soon!…\n",

      "Review is :OK, I'm not Greek, but I've been coming to Greece since about 2005, and AVA HOTEL AND SUITES is always the hotel we return to for at least a few nights. Why? The location is smack in the center of Plaka, so you are close to all tourist sites plus tons of fun shopping and wonderful tavernas. The rooms are real suites with a mini-kitchen, which is almost as good as having your own private apartment in the center of Athens. The beds, the ac, the bathroom are all high quality, and some street side rooms have terraces with close up views of The Acropolis. And then there's the amazing staff. No request is too much, the level of help is beyond what we've ever found at most hotels in all our years of traveling. To top if off, there's a lovely breakfast every morning to start your day off right. Book this hotel if you're looking for one of the best boutique experiences in Athens. You won't be sorry!…\n",

EVERYONE we encountered were extremely friendly and eager to please. By far, the best hotel experience we've had. The location is minutes away from the Metro, the Tram, local bus and on-off bus lines. Shops and restaurants are down the block or around the corner. Entrances to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum are a 10-15 minute walk away... unless you stop for a gelato.  To the fabulous staff at AVA, thank you for making us feel at home.\n",

Our room was spacious & beautifully appointed. House-keeping gets 5-stars! The front desk was well-informed and assisted my husband & me with dining options, directions, transfers & helpful tips! Special kudos to Vassia & Panegiota. Our room was VERY quiet...hard to believe we were in the middle of a large city.  The 15 room hotel is centrally located to all the “must-sees”....Acropolis, Syntagma Square & the changing of the guard,  Acropolis Museum, Mar’s Hill, National Garden, Hadrian’s Arch and  Lykavittos Hill. Lots of lovely restaurants within walking distance. We didn’t have to take a single taxi during our 3 night stay.  What an amazing start to our month long stay in Greece!…\n",

In 7 days, I was able to explore so many corners of the city with ease. I can't think of any better location.  That's coupled with world-class amenities. This is a small hotel that hits above its weight. From large suite size by European standards to great views (exec+), I felt that I gained full value from what I spent. My stay was booked under the Athens Experience category. This included a substantive breakfast, Acropolis tickets and a tasting. To top it off, cleanliness is kept to a very high standard.

      "Review is :I stayed here actually for a business trip in August 2022 for 2 nights.  - Location: Great. In Plaka, which I love, and far enough away from the noise.  - Checkin: Went smoothly, very friendly staff - First impression: Hotel is quite old style and could use a renovation.  - Room: Spacious, has a kitchen area (that I don’t really need) and plenty of space. Quite loud, you hear people talking in the hallway. Pillows too big and not really comfortable. Room temperature fine, air conditioning is easy to use. Bathroom fine.  - My room wasn’t cleaned, so I’m not sure if you have to ask specifically to get your room cleaned if you are staying for more than one night. Considering the price, this is rather strange.\n",

Most of my friends have traveled to Athens via cruise ship and I’m not sure their experience was quite the same and it all comes down to the neighborhood. This place is steps from everything you want to see in Athens. Maybe I could have found a cheaper hotel just as nice somewhere else, but I would have spent money and time everyday trying to get to the sites. This is a very touristy area, but I loved it. Much cleaner, less graffiti, not a seedy sketchy area like so many other parts of Athens. Ok and the staff, I can’t say enough. One of the staff members helped us our entire stay trying to track down our luggage and thanks to her we finally got it!!  She also helped me translate my temporary Greek…\n",

Our original plan was to stay at the Electra Palace, but when we went to rebook for summer 2022 the Electra Palace was not available, so we researched other Athens hotels and we hit the jackpot with the AVA Hotel.  I'm sure the Electra Palace would have been great, but the AVA hotel was fantastic.  It is a small, quaint hotel located within walking distance to the Acropolis, not too far from the Olympic stadium, right under Hadrian's arch.  There are lots of restaurants and small shops just up the street, yet this hotel was nice and quiet.  Besides the location, what really set this hotel apart is the service.

When we looked for a hotel in Athens, all we knew was that we wanted to be somewhere \"near\" the Acropolis--and the rest of Classical antiquity. We knew nothing about the city at all except that it was large and had a lot of ruins to go see. We chose this hotel because, based on its website, it seemed like a lovely 4-star, with a view to the Acropolis, and had the room that we wanted/needed. That's it.  Who knew that it was at the convenient edge of Plaka--the area of the city where you definitely want to go if not be when you're in Athens: where things are going on and happening? Who knew that it was small enough to be \"personal\" but still very professional? On both counts it is, and comes through…\n",

We had a separate bedroom, and the kid could sleep on the sofa.  The hotel is clean, very neat, and has very helpful staff. The staff is always there to give you a piece of advice, explains how to get to the places of interest.  More, the hotel is situated in the perfect place. You have like 5 mins walking to Acropolis, 2 minutes to great restaurants in Plaka, 1 minute to Ruined Temple.  I highly recommend this hotel!\n",

I’m giving it 4 stars rather than 5, only because I did not feel excited to return to my room, as I may have been with the pricier Grande Bretagne (where one may use Marriott points but they did not permit me to use points for a room with a view of the Acropolis).\n",

Having a room equipped with a kitchen is a perfect option for families, two rooms and a spacious terrace with an Acropolis view allowed us to spend nice evenings While the children were sleeping.

We were surprised when we were told by Marios (who is extremely responsive through email prior to our trip) that they arranged for our room to be ready since they saw that we had an early arrival!  They brought out bags to our room and two delicious bottles of white sparkling wine.  This hotel is on a quiet street, steps from Plaka…with loads of charming restaurants and shops.  It is also a 5 minute walk to the acropolis, so an amazing location.  We were served our complimentary breakfast in the am.

The housekeeping staff did a great job, kept the place spotless. The reception was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was good. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect in the middle of the Historical Centre, in the Plaka area. This is the perfect area to stay, as it mainly has pedestrian roads. So we could visit all the Greek classical treasures on foot. Plenty of nice restaurants and bars around to enjoy great food and relax. You do not feel at all being actually in a big city when staying in Plaka. Would definitely recommend this hotel in Plaka.\n",

Since this was our first time in Athens, it was perfect for us.  But it is not really a boutique hotel. No spa, gym or pool. We would also recommend putting espresso machines in the room, something which has become rather ordinary for boutique hotels over the world. Or at least having the option for espresso coffee in the lobby during the day. No real place to sit and have a drink in the lobby.  So, we would definitely recommend this hotel.

The front desk did not miss a thing. From the wonderful buffet breakfasts, to customized tours, use of the meeting room, restaurant recommendations, and ground transportation, we explored Plaka and enjoyed coming back to AVA each night! Their communication and attention to detail is impeccable. We would come back in a heartbeat! Thank you, AVA!!\n",

      "Review is :ANA Hotel is located directly between Hadrian's Arch and the Acropolis. If you turn left out of the hotel entrance, you are about 500 steps from Hadrian's Arch.  If you turn right, you are about a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis.  There was a great view from our balcony.  I believe that all rooms in the hotel are suites, with a small kitchen area, a small dining area, a large common room, and a separate good-sized bedroom.  Very spacious.  The staff was very helpful in finding us a guide, making restaurant reservations, etc.  Also, the price was very good for an Athens Hotel (about 345-euro per night when we went).  The only thing which was not totally positive was that breakfast, which was included in the price, was acceptable but not great.\n",

Outstanding staff who were welcoming and helpful at all times. Quiet inside. Comfortable bed. We would return in a minute. We miss the AVA Hotel already.\n",

We got upgraded to a suite and so enjoyed a lovely living room and terrace in addition to a nice-sized bedroom and a very modern bathroom with an umbrella shower head.  The staff were all very friendly and couldn’t have been more accommodating with an early breakfast for us one morning to extra towels to helpful info on restaurants.  And the breakfast buffet has something for everyone.  Pastry, hot dishes, cold meats and cheeses, olives, tomatoes, lots of fresh and dried fruits, and the ability to order pancakes or eggs to your liking, if you choose.  I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in this city!!!\n",

I booked the Regular Suite for one night, before my trip to the islands; then again, I booked the Executive Suite for four nights at Athens. Spacious suite with a bedroom and a living room, kitchenette, and a marble bathroom with shower and a bath tub. Perfect location in safe quiet area. I would like to suggest that the iron is included within the amenities rather than to be given upon request.\n",

The hotel is well appointed, The room we had faced the courtyard and therefore very quiet. The bed was large and firm like we prefer it.  The room  had a small kitchenette stocked with good ground coffee and tea, which we did not expect and two complimentary bottles of sparkling which was a welcome treat.

The staff was friendly and met all our requests - a sheet under the duvet, a taxi from the airport and to the port.  It is not an inexpensive hotel, but it's worth the price.

We decided to walk over to make the reservation in person, since we were close by. When we walked in and asked the man at the desk, he said they were completely booked. We then walked outside and made the reservation online. Not a great experience. However, it was a lovely hotel. Very quiet, despite being in a busy, touristy neighborhood. The bed was extremely comfortable, they gave us free champagne (not amazing, but a nice touch), and the other woman who worked at the front desk was quite nice and helpful. So, other than the one snobby guy who didn't want to give us a room, it was quite nice.\n",

And the hotel itself is delightful.  The rooms are large and spotlessly clean.  The staff is friendly and helpful.

The service was excellent: they bent over backwards to help us arrange tours and meals. All in all, we were really happy with this hotel and thought it was great value.

The staff is always outstanding, the suites are lovely and huge by European standards, and the location is unbeatable for Athens. You can walk to almost any tourist destination in 30 minutes or less. I actually feel a bit homesick each time we leave because we are treated more like members of the family at this point than guests. There aren't many places that know how to do that anymore, but AVA is one of them. This hotel is deservedly popular in Athens, so if you're looking for a wonderful, comfortable hotel with excellent AC  ( also sometimes a rarity in Athens) look no further. Book while you can!\n",

We chose the hotel because it was one of the few in the historic Plaka neighborhood with king-sized beds. (My husband and I are big and tall.) We got so much than we bargained for. Our standard room was more like a studio apartment with a mini kitchen and ample space. Our little balcony looked over an interior courtyard and afforded a view of a beautiful spill of hot pink bougainvillea. I think a lot of the hotel's wonderful features are standard with a four-star establishment (bathrobes, hairdryer, slippers) but there were so many other comforts that went above and beyond: ample surface area in the bathroom for toiletries, truly wonderful coffee for the in-room coffee maker, his and hers reading…\n",

It is less than 5 min walk to the Acropolis & 2 minutes from tourist shopping. The National Gardens, Panhellenic stadium, & Parliament are with 15 minutes of walking. They kindly arranged our transportation from the airport & delivered sparkling wine when we arrived.

It was so nice to sit out there at night and gaze on its beauty. The staff was amazing and they arranged a great walking tour of everything with Bobbie. We had wine waiting in our room when we arrived, we had a kitchen and the bathroom had a beautiful painted ceiling. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was great every morning. We were spoiled here in the heart of everything in our penthouse room. We had a great stay and if you are thinking of staying here; do it! You won’t regret it.\n",

It is also close to the Acropolis, which could be seen from the balcony of our room.   The staff was friendly and tried to help us in any way we needed. They ordered a taxi for an early morning airport transfer, printed out our next flight’s boarding passes, and helped book a tour of the acropolis for us. They also have a good selection of books and movies (movies upon request)  in the lobby. We were given champagne the day we checked in.   The bathrooms were especially modern and clean, along with the entire room. Definitely a great hotel I would recommend!\n",

The Executive Suite is roomy (559 sq ft), modern, exceptionally clean, and has a balcony that has Hardian's Arch (and the Temple of Zeus) out one side and the Acropolis out the other.

There was a small fridge in the room ideal for storing soft drinks, fruit or cold meats and cheese for making a sandwich should you not have the inclination to eat in a restaurant.  The hotel serves a breakfast with the possibility to have eggs sausage and bacon with the usual continental breakfast of cold meats, cheeses, rolls toast and jam.

We had originally almost booked another hotel where we had status but now after being in Athens we couldn’t be happier we ultimately choose the Ava.  As everyone before has reiterated the location is superb.  Right next to Hadrian’s arch and National Garden as well as Plaka which has numerous restaurants, bars and shopping.  It’s also super close to the Acropolis.  Our suite was a great size and it was nice having the kitchenette which had a refrigerator and other essentials.  The hotel even gave complimentary champagne which was a very nice treat.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful and we couldn’t have asked for a better stay.  Thanks again for a great experience.\n",

Staff was especially attentive. Shout out to Vassias who worked the front desk and dining room-even opened it up early for us on our last day so we could have breakfast before leaving for the airport. Kind of pricey but worth it.

Our suite in this boutique hotel had a magnificent view of the Acropolis one way and Hadrians Arch the other. Breakfast was included every day and had everything you could want. Because the street is one way it is best to suggest your taxi pick you up a few meters away on the Main Street to avoid traffic in the Plaka.   You can easily walk to the Parthenon, the museum, the ancient agora and explore the vast Plaka shops on foot. If you have time you should visit the meat, fish and spice shops too about 30 minutes away.   Excellent hotel so book early.\n",

      "Review is :My husband and 3 children (ages 5,3 and 1) just recently visited the Ava and had a wonderful experience!!! For starters, I had some difficulty finding a hotel that would accommodate the size of our family, and one that allowed young children.  The Ava was honestly a perfect choice!! We stayed in the Executive Suite which had a king size bed in a bedroom with doors that closed, and included a pack and playfor my 1 year old.  Then the living room had a pull out couch and a chair that turned into a single bed.  The space was perfect for our family and I would HIGHLY recommend it for families.  We had a great view of the temple of Zeus and the Parthenon from our balcony off of the living room, a large bathroom and small kitchenette area.  The location was also ideal as we were right…\n",

It's a boutique hotel, situated between the Acropolis and the Temple of Zeus (when I stepped out onto our little balcony, I could see one in each direction) -- on a little cobbled street that will make you feel like you've stepped back in time.  We like the feeling of being in another country when we're in another country.  There's a little kitchen if you wish to use it.  We can't speak to the breakfast that was included, as we walked a short couple of blocks to a row of local restaurants for breakfast each morning instead.

Our rooms were spacious and so comfortable and we wanted to take the rain shower home with us! Best were the views from our balcony - to the left was Hadrian's Arch and to the right was a beautiful view of the Acropolis. You just can't get better than that! Breakfast at the hotel was good - the fresh squeezed orange juice, espresso and food spread was impressive. The hotel staff was so accommodating and helpful and even brought us champagne. We just loved it in Athens and at the AVA - when we return to Athens, this will be where we stay again.\n",

The location is prefect as it’s in walking distance to most of the tourist attractions.  Although it’s in the heart of the city one does not feel the hustle and bustle of the city.  The only thing I had an issue with is the breakfast was not included and what they offer is definitely not worth the money.  Limited selection and they do not open till 7:30am.\n",

Our room was clean, and the bathroom was updated, the rest of the room was a strange but perfectly fine decor.   The real problem was the bed: the sheets were really rough and uncomfortable. We both had to sleep fully clothed.   For 300+ euro, which is what we spent on our room, you would at least expect a comfortable bed with nice enough sheets.

They gave us recommendations for dinner each night and the good places to walk around. The breakfast that is included was great and the staff at breakfast were just so sweet and kind. The location was ideal for walking around the city and the rooms were spacious and up to date! We had a suit with the Acropolis view that had a bedroom, small kitchen and living area plus a balcony with great views. We would certainly stay here again and highly recommend to others.\n",

      "Review is :Yes we booked after reading the reviews here before and it fulfills all comments well. We had a nice quiet room to the back. No view but very quiet which we like and prefer over a view with cars :).  The hotel is small but big rooms (ours was real big) with a small but nicely equipped bathroom. My personal need is a good rain drop shower with hot and water pressure up. Jup- got that.  Location right of the Hadrian gate is perfect. You find your hotel any time.  Tip: do not get a uber at the airport to the hotel but to Hadrian’s gate. 20 Meters to walk and no waiting if the street in Plaka is backed up. The same is even more critical for return. Get the uber at the gate and you save 15-20 minutes.\n",

The rooms spacious rooms are very quiet (my wife is a light sleep and would let me know if there was a noise issue...sorry, honey :o) ).  Our room was on the second floor, facing the street and had no problem with noise.  The hotel is not on a main street.  It is on a small, one way side street between the Arch of Hadrian (1/2 block away) and the Acropolis (about 3 blocks away).    Attentive and professional staff.  Beds are nice and firm too.  I highly recommend it!!!\n",

And, on a day we were a bit late for breakfast, the staff allowed us to eat and didn't rush us. So polite and courteous.   Our room was amazing - very spacious, clean, and just what was needed after a long day of touring Athens. It was a suite, which I would recommend. We had two balconies that overlooked the Parthenon and other attractions. Although the room was on the main street side, there was not excessive noise in the evening. We were able to rest. The hotel is also just a few minutes walk to a great market/shopping area. Lots of shops for souvenirs. There are also unique clothing stores. One such is Sadao…\n",

It's located in the heart of Plaka, on a street both overlooking the Acropolis at one end and the Arch of Hadrian at the other end.  We had booked an Executive suite with a balcony, which was wonderful - not just because of the view, but also because it was so clean, roomy and modern.  The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds ever - wide and firm, ensuring a good night's sleep.  It had a lot of wonderful and practical details: at least one trash bin in every room, plenty of closet space, sufficient lighting, kitchenette, coffee maker, two separate showers (one with a bathtub) in the bathroom and not one but two…\n",

Easily walk from the Acropolis to the original Olympic Stadium.  Easy access to hop-on, hop-off buses.  Walk or short uber rides to restaurants and shops.   Wonderful.  We did an inexpensive upgrade to a one-bedroom suite.  Expect a very comfortable and clean room.  Well appointed by any standard.  Room includes a generous and well-prepared breakfast delivered on time to the room.  Expect friendly and helpful service in English.  The glowing reviews are true.

It seems that the bedroom decors have been recently updated, but the bathrooms look a little outdated (but were very clean, and provided nice hot showers.) The front desk staff were very helpful with recommendations and directions. I enjoyed coming “home” to this small hotel after long days of sight seeing! Ask for a higher floor away from the stairs if you like quiet.\n",

We had maybe the two best restaurant meals we’ve ever had at two different restaurants in Athens (Aleria and Spondi). I usually spend a decent amount of time reading TripAdvisor,  etc. looking looking at hotels. Save yourself some time, Ava is really nice. FYI it is not like a US business hotel like Marriott or something. It is a nice, large clean room with all the amenities of a US business hotel, just not the giant lobby.\n",

There were three of us: two adults and one child. They easily accommodated the third person with a nice day bed. However, as we were getting settled we soon realized that the floor was covered in hair. We called down to the  desk and we asked for the floor to be cleaned.

Firstly, the location is exceptional.  It was a five minute walk to the new Acropolis museum and the ticket box for the Acropolis.  The room was large enough that the kids slept on pull out beds in the lounge room and it didn't feel cramped.  The rooms were quiet and we couldn't hear any street noise or the noise of other guests.  The bathroom was surprisingly large for a European hotel and it was convenient to have a little kitchenette so that we could give the kids breakfast or snacks when they wanted (on the first morning the jet lag meant that we ate at 4.30am).  Our rooms were very clean and well maintained.  Lastly,…\n",

The staff was as pleasant as we remembered, and though thoroughly remodeled so that we had trouble recognizing the entrance, the AVA is still a very attractive hotel with beautiful spacious rooms.  The kitchenette is a great bonus and we were glad to have a place to store our snacks and the Greek cheeses that we'd gotten as souvenirs.   There were 2 issues we had this trip that made the stay less than perfect.  We came with a car this time and though there is a space reserved in front of the hotel to unload luggage, there is no parking lot and no valet parking service.  The Plaka is a great location for sightseeing, but no fun to maneuver with a car while hunting for a 24…\n",

The hotel is very well positioned in the Plaka, visiting the city and for the sites of antiquity around central Athens, but is extremely quiet. Definitely one of the very best hotels we have stayed in anywhere in the world.  It is worth mentioning that the hotel is superbly positioned in Athens for a quick daytime break, rest or change in the room whilst out and about in the city during the summer heat.  I would just like to mention the breakfast service and food preparation staff- they were outstanding every day and we found the reception desk staff pleasant, welcoming and helpful.

After a long flight, it was nice having two rooms for us to spread out in. The staff was very helpful and arranged transportation as well as a private tour guide for us. There was a simple buffet breakfast and my kids enjoyed it too. I've also stayed at the Grande Bretagne which is amazing, but AVA is the hotel I would really recommend for families, especially those only in Athens for a short period who wants to be close to the main attractions. Very good value.\n",

Location. ...location location: Yes, the AVA hotel has it all: It's in the middle of the historic and cozy  Plaka district. I think that you just cannot be in a better location to enjoy Athens, right on your doorstep.  It's so nice to be able to walk out and go for sightseeing or a meal on any of a hundred street side restaurants without the need for a taxi. A view of the Akropolis as well as the Hadrians Arch and the Temple of Zeus from the Balcony of the suite is the ultimate in bringing history to your doorstep.

The hotel has an excellent central location in The Plaka, minutes away from The Acropolis and other touristic sites. The staff goes above and beyond to help with recommendations and help when you need it. Rooms are some of the best we've had at any hotel in Athens, and that includes the fabled Grande Bretagne. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say! The only problem now is that the hotel is so popular, it's becoming harder to get reservations. So plan way ahead for one of the nicest- and I think best - hotels in Athens!\n",

The bed was the most comfortable one we slept on during our two week travel in Greece.  As others mentioned, the location is simply perfect. The hotel in on a quiet street while within a few steps of hustle and bustle of Plaka and all main tourist attractions.   Every morning we looked forward to our breakfast. Every food item was fresh and eggs to order were simply perfection. This was also the best breakfast we've had during our two week stay in Greece and Greek islands. The staff is kind and very accommodating.   When we come back to Athens, we will only stay at AVA hotel.\n",

The property is located in the Plaka district of Athens and the location can't be beat.  The Acropolis is right in front of you.  The path up to the site is around the corner.  The Plaka itself is an interesting place to wander. Everything we did in Athens except for the National Archaeology Museum was walking distance.  That required a €5.00 taxi ride but don't miss it.  It contains some amazing treasures.  The property itself is very nice.  The rooms are large with a desk, sitting area, and kitchen area.

We wanted to be close to the Acropolis and major sites with easy transport links out for mini jaunts and in an area where any of us would feel safe and comfortable popping out to the shops. We needed separate rooms for them, and us, but within close range, and a decent breakfast was pretty important too.  These teenagers can eat a lot, and like their sleep.   The AVA delivers on all points. The kids had a standard room/suite, we traded up a level to get a separate bedroom and sitting area.

We chose the AVA mainly because of the location and it certainly is ideally situated close to the Acropolis and Hadrian's Gate (the latter being at the end of the hotel's street). Just around the corner are many taverna's and restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. Yes, you do have to run the gauntlet of people urging you to look at their menu but a polite \"no thanks\" or \"we already have a booking\" will usually suffice.

At the end of our trip, he took us to the train station and went in with us and stood in line with us to make sure we could communicate with the clerk and get the type of train ticket we wanted.  Fantastic service!  Great location for visiting the Acropolis, etc.\n",

Super friendly staff, good amenities, great location, brilliant room (although the floors were hard and you might get some noise from neighbours) with everything you would need, including a kitchenette with tea and coffee making too! Close to historical Athens and a short walk to pretty much everything you would want to see, including the Acropolis Museum (you must go!!!) - and also a plethora of food choices with the local restaurants on your doorstep. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a really pleasant stay in a great location - thanks for making our stay a memorable one!\n",

The location is also almost perfect for tourists. You can't get any closer to the fun stuff it was an absolute great place to stay.  And although I didn't have any of the food it looked really good and I wish I had time to have some.  A small quaint hotel perfect for couples or as I was travelling by myself it was also great also great for travellers by themselves that have a little extra money to spend on accommodations.\n",

Exclusive suite 301 has a terrific view of the Acropolis and tons of space for entertaining, which was important to use as we were celebrating our 30th anniversary with 46 friends and had friends each every night to enjoy the Acropolis view from the balcony and get photos of them with that view in the background. One night, we had lots of lightning and I got some nice shots of that over the Acropolis.  The hotel wasn’t large enough to accommodate everyone in our group (even with us planning the trip 18 months in advance as this hotel has only16 rooms), but those who stayed with us here all seemed to really enjoy the hotel.

It is a not so new boutique hotel by the looks of its elevator and rooms but service is very personalized because it only has a total of 16 rooms so one has to book earlier if one intends to stay here.  Hotel staff are friendly and helpful especially Stavros.  There is even a kitchen in our room for those who want to do some cooking.  Buffet breakfast is ok.  Aside from having to take the shower inside the bath tub sideways, the only other drawback for this hotel is you can hear the noise from the subway/metro from the room.  So if you're a light sleeper, you may want to consider other hotels.\n",

They emailed ahead of time to check in with us seeing if we needed anything. They were nice and accommodating to my wife when we arrived late and she had gotten sick. They provided different medicines for her. And they brought us two small bottles of champagne just because!  I would stay here again in a heart beat. I'm shocked it's not more expensive!\n",

Marios at the front desk greeted us and gave us wonderful recommendations for dinner (Psaras-Elia), the room was spacious and luxurious, and the hotel's location could not be better-  a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis, and steps away from Hadrians Gate and the Temple of Zeus.   For those looking to explore the old part of the city, with a comfortable home to come back to for relaxation, look no further.\n",

Bed very comfortable, staff very friendly and helpful. Small kitchenette available in room. Plenty of wardrobe room. Good size hairdryer. Air con worked well. This hotel is in walking distance of the Plaka region with many restaurants and shops. Also within very easy walking distance of other shopping areas and the Acropolis, Hadrians Gate and other sites. Very short wwlk to bus stop for hop on hop off bus. We had a balcony with sitting area but it was way too hot to be outside. Very pleasant place to stay.\n",

While it was beautiful, it was much more than I needed. I went to the front desk to inquire about changing my room and the gentleman in charge was not very accommodating. I was told there was a regular suite available and the person at the desk had to talk to his manager. When I talked to the manager, I was told he could move me to the lower room but that I still had to pay the executive rate. When I asked him why, he said that the executive rooms do not get booked so he would lose money if he moved me down to the regular room. Add this to the fact that they were eager to move a roll out bed into my room for an extra charge when I mentioned we were…\n",

We had plenty of room for the three of us and it was a lovely, quiet hotel very close to the Acropolis and the old section of Athens.  We were also close to restaurants, shopping, and other historical sites.  The hotel is modern, very comfortable, near one of the main streets but on a quiet side street.  While we were there, it was quiet and a great place to collapse after a long, hot day on the ruins.  The staff was helpful and we very much enjoyed our stay there.  Also provided very good breakfasts--great croissants.  The view was not spectacular as we looked at a building across the street--but if you looked to the right, we could see, at night, a flag waving over the illuminated…\n",

I just came from the AVA, spent one night with my family (actually barely 8 hours) and was told I was going to be charged 376 euros for the night (I booked a large room so my family of 5 would be comfortable).  376 Euros for the small, stuffy, basic boutique hotel that is not impressive in any way, is a generous amount I would argue. HOWEVER-- on our way out, at 5:30am to catch a ferry, we were given a bill that charged us an EXTRA 102 Euros.  Total room charge was 478 EURO.  Absolutely a rip off, and they told us of this charge as we were about to jump into a taxi.  I was charged \"extra\" since they had to bring a rollaway bed to…\n",

The property is of a very decent standard without being over the top, a quality smaller hotel rather than a glitzy 5 star palace. Friendly staff and a reasonable breakfast complete the mix.

There was a small kitchenette as well. My kids loved the old-fashioned elevator.

Was a bit shocked by the amount of graffiti on the street (see photos) but all Athens seems to be like this!  Ava hotel really is a lovely little place and the location is great. Plaka is (despite the graffiti) a picturesque area and it's a great location for the Acropolis.  I stayed in room 401 which has a nice little courtyard.

We stayed in an Executive Suite which was very roomy, comfortable and had all the amenities. Excellent breakfast with eggs and bacon cooked to order. The staff contacted is six weeks in advance and arranged a private Acropolis tour for us with a wonderful guide. We would definitely recommend and would stay again. Went for a wedding at the end of June and it was very hot. Would avoid this time of year next time.\n",

Nice bottle of bubbles was waiting for us in our room when we arrived and the room was spotless at all times. The best thing about this hotel, though, is location. Just a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis museum and well situated for the other attractions of Athens. Breakfast was also substantial and tasty. Very nice experience overall!\n",

Either view from street front is attractive with Zeus to the East and Acropolis to the West.  Boutique hotel with friendly staff, welcoming lobby, and spacious extremely well appointed rooms with bathrooms having two shower heads for that ever relaxing shower after a day in the heat.  Plenty of shopping begins after two rights out of the hotel.  Breakfast is very convenient in the lobby with a variety of offerings for any kind of taste, and worth the very reasonable charge.  Nice relaxing happy hour 7-9 pm and many restaurant options within a short walking distance.  One of the best boutique hotels we have stayed in.  Highest…\n",

I was afraid we would get small rooms because of the great location of this hotel, just few minutes walk from the Acropolis. Well we didnt...both our rooms were big, comfortable and clean with a small kitchinette, and a good-sized bathroom. The staff was very kind, polite and helpful during our stay; the breakfast was good with a good variety of food...the pita bread though was missing :). Thank you Ava hotel for a lovely stay in Athens!\n",

You are a short walk from a whole bundle of historic sites, restaurants, bars and small shops. Ava has a friendly staff and the rooms are pure oasis from the heat and hustle and bustle that can be a part of Athens on a hot summer day. Our room had a big balcony where we would have our breakfast and drinks. The rooms has a small kitchen where there is an extra fridge you can fill with your refreshments of choice. The rooms are elegantly decorated the bathroom in room 301 is a bit bigger than 302, but these two rooms a re great with separate living room and bedroom. Perfect for our little family of 3.\n",

The rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable and I am not easy to please in that department. Bathroom shower worked well and was supplied with towels and toiletries. The a/c worked great and room location was quiet. So between the location, bed, and room darkening shades, a great night sleep was accomplished. I would recommend this place highly. They do have a restaurant that serves a full breakfast but we chose to dine out. We stayed in room 304. Faces the back away from street. No great view but who cares, sleep is the priority here.\n",

The staff were very pleasant, helpful and very considerate. After travelling some 24 hours we were welcomed by reception and shown our room with the minimum of fuss or administration. The room was on the 3rd floor, clean well maintained with cooking facilities and mini bar. Our second post cruise room we chose was on the ground floor. Both had ample storage for our cases and a divine bathroom. The location in Plaka was within a short walk to the Accropolis and its museum. Very handy for restaurants and shopping in Plaka.

Tried to call room service and it was a little late, and they denied all requests. Athens is nothing like Mykonos or Santorini. If you take a trip to Greece, don't waste your money in Athens, tons of graffiti and generally unsafe atmosphere. Spent 320 Euros on a suite here, last leg of my honeymoon, and regret it.\n",

Walk to Acropolis, other historic sites and nearby museums.

      "Review is :We had only a one night stop over in Athens and picked this hotel from TA.   They arranged transfer to the hotel from the airport, which is very helpful.   We had a twin room as requested. Bedroom is a good size, as is the bathroom. Even has a decent kitchenette. There is also a plethora of DVDs available (in English) - but we didn't have time.   The hotel is close to the Acropolis and Parliament (you must go and watch the changing of the guards - every hour on the hour).   The day we left, there was a taxi strike and we were facing dragging our suitcases on the train, but they managed to work out a way to get us there. Thank goodness.   Even though our stay was short, it was perfect for our needs.   Thanks to the staff for all their help.\n",

We had a comfortable suite with a living area and bedroom with a small balcony.  The view of the Acropolis is stunning -- and just out the front door if you don't have it from your room. The kitchenette was a real plus.       The neighborhood is in the heart of ancient Athens. Everything you could want is in easy reach -- restaurants, small bakeries, bistros, and grocery shops where you can easily get your own breakfast and snacks.     But the secret sauce for Hotel Ava is the staff. Their knowledgable advice really helped us…\n",

The beds were really comfortable and the room was very clean. We received bottles of sparkling wine on arrival, which we really enjoyed. Three negatives that keep it from being a perfect experience: (1) the staff are responsive and professional, but not nearly as warm and kind as at every other hotel we stayed at in Greece, (2) the wifi is free but incredibly slow from the higher floors, and (3) the incremental cost of breakfast is quite high, like…\n",

Not a huge deal but there was also an unfortunate occurrence badly handled which left a bad taste.  They offered us an upgrade when we arrived for a certain amount which we took but the clerk neglected to tell us there was also a substantial extra charge for our daughter even though we had booked a Triple Room. So when we went to pay and asked how much to stay for a few days longer, there was conflict. Not handled at all graciously: \"I guess it was my fault\". Hotel fairly empty and yet when we requested a late check out on the last day they were relatively inflexible. Again, nothing major but just.....not as…\n",

The standard suite was quite large, and included a kitchenette, which was very convenient, as we wanted to have our own breakfast, and pack our own lunches.    The hotel is an easy walk to the Acropolis and to the metro station on one side, and close to Syntagma square, on the other.    The one drawback was that the WI-Fi, while free, was slow (although the same was true of data speed on our Greek Sim cards, so it may be true of Greece in general).    On the whole, though, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ava, and would strongly recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Athens.\n",

The breakfast was more on a continental basis, but adequate.

We upgraded to an Executive Suite and we were glad we did. The suite was large and very quiet. The first two mornings we did not wake up until 11:39 as we recovered from jet lag. The location is great. Right in the middle of Plaka's shops, dining and walking plus close to all the major sites we wanted to visit. Mina at the front desk was very pleasant and was always ready to give directions or recommendations when asked. We did not try the breakfast so I can not comment on its value or quality.   Only negative thing to say about Athens is that someone tried hard to pick her wallet out of her purse on the Metro but her anti-theft device thwarted…\n",

They were able to accommodate a last minute room switch with ease. The staff will do anything to make your stay great. All of their restaurant recommendations were outstanding. the breakfast is prepared and served with care- anything you could ask for.  There was an issue with the wifi and the staff did everything they could to fix the issue.  Our rooms were interior so no view and very quiet. A great place to stay close to the action but a private slice of heaven.\n",

We agreed that the carpet was beige..but, also FILTHY. She took us to another upgraded rooms, which had a housekeeper in it cleaning. All furniture in that room was up on the bed, sofa..with a broom wrapped with a cloth..cleaning the carpet. Dirty also... The hotel otherwise was nice. How the hotel could allow a room with carpets full of stains, & dirty through out the suite is a Greek mystery.\n",

We stayed for 3 nights in an executive suite which was attractive, spotlessly clean, very spacious, quiet, and had comfortable beds. From our little balcony, we could see both the Pantheon and Hadrian's Arch.  The location was perfect--we could easily walk to everything we were interested in seeing--the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch, the Acropolis Museum, good restaurants, and lots of shops.  Staff at the front desk and at breakfast were all very friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

The hotel was in walking distance to many good restaurants and txi's came quickly.  We stayed for 2 nights pre cruise and it was a great experience.  We used the transfer service from the hotel and although a little more expensive then a taxi, it was convenient to be met after a long flight.  When we left for our cruise, the front desk staff made sure that the taxi drivers understood where we were going.  My brother in law forgot his Tilly hat, but it has already arrived back safe and sound!!\n",

Austerity, poverty and “swarms” of migrants/refugees filling its streets, it’s been made to look like a hell-hole. What nonsense! Don’t get me wrong – it’s clear that Athens has got it tough economically, but, for my first-ever visit to the city, I thought it was fantastic. The people, in particular, are amongst the friendliest of any city I’ve been to. They may have it tough – but they know how to make the best of things and made this foreigner’s visit a pleasure.  The AVA Hotel is on the edge of the Plaka – the main Athens tourist area. All the major tourist sites are within 15 to 20 minutes’ walking distance from it (although there is this little tourist-train that trundles around the streets…\n",

They do offer breakfast at 14 euro per person which we did once. I was not a fan. There is a hotel restaurant within 5 min walk from there - Athens gate restaurant - which I do highly recommend.

The major tourist attractions are also within easy walking distance. Fabulous. Without exception, the staff were friendly, cheerful and extremely helpful and helped to make our stay for my wife's birthday very, very special. I recommend the Ava without hesitation.\n",

The check in counter was small and old.  The lobby was small with \"old\" smell.   There was 1 tiny elevator.  There was a small room to the left of entrance where they have breakfast every morning.  This is a very small hotel.  I think they only have rooms on 3 floors and maybe 5-7 rooms on each floor so not much rooms for flexibility.

      "Review is :The Ava is a small boutique hotel located in the Plaka District in walking distance to the Temple of Zeus, Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Hadrian's Arch and some great alfresco dining options.  We stayed in room 304 which was a studio suite with a little built in kitchen and plenty of space.  It did not seem the type of hotel that catered for large bus loads of tourists which was a bonus.  Those on concierge were helpful and friendly. On our initial arrival in Athens we stayed in a different hotel (supposedly 5 stars) which was a 4 minute walk from the Ava and connected to a tour we were doing to Delphi & Meteora.  We thought this other hotel was dreadfully overpriced and after arriving at the Ava on our last day in Athens we were pleasantly surprised on how much better the room…\n",

      "Review is :Lovely boutique hotel with very spacious rooms. We had a one bedroom suite with a very large sitting room where our 2 teenage boys slept. The bedroom is also spacious. The location is just fabulous, in the historical centre of Athens. Situated in Plaka, in the shadow of the Acropolis it was perfect for our 2 nights there. The only downside was they were unable to give us a late checkout.  Due to a snafu in our travel arrangements I arrived a day earlier with my younger son , with my husband and older son following on the next afternoon. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. We had a chilled bottle of sparkling wine in our room compliments of the management which set us in the right mood for our holiday, given its inauspicious start.\n",

Excellent rooms - we had a one bedroom suite and a normal suite twin room for the children - superb. Thanks to Mina and Maria and the guys too - you made us feel very special. Breakfast  is included and worth it. We also booked the package which included the Greek tasting lunch or dinner plus entry fees to many of the attractions and museum - absolutely great value. If we come back again will definitely stay here. Thank you.\n",

They also gave us the tip of getting our tickets when we saw no line since we could use them any time in the next five days.  A bottle of champagne was waiting for us and the room was spacious and clean.  There was a full compliment of morning beverage options (something we found not to be common in all hotels).  The location was super close to the Acropolis and the museum.  Close to lots of food options and shops.  We didn't have a car so this was a must.    The staff continued being helpful…\n",

I've been coming to Greece 15 years and of course I would never go back to this hotel since we've had wonderful experiences in other hotels. Breakfast was not included so we didn't try it.

The breakfast had everything you could want and more, juice being freshly squeezed while you wait. They didn't even charge us for the breakfast when we arrived the first day before check-in.   The location is great, close to the Temple of Zeus and all the shops and restaurants of the Plaka.  A definite revisit when we ome back to Athens.  The room was very nice and very comfortable.

From the pictures I thought it would be more modern.   It's definitely not a luxury hotel, but it was clean and met our needs.

      "Review is :We stayed for 2 nights at the Ava and loved it.  It is right on the edge of the old city, is really easy to find after wandering around those crazy streets, and had everything we were looking for.  Our room had a queen sized bed, small kitchen (never used it), two fridges, and a funky ceilinged bathroom with a great shower.  There is no restaurant but the lounge serves a great breakfast including very good expresso.    If you're looking for a place to sleep, shower and use as a base, this is the perfect hotel.  It was very affordable and the staff were exceptionally helpful sorting out places to eat, cabs and so on.  We'd stay again for sure.\n",

Our suite had laminate floorboards which appeared new and in very good condition rather than carpet which I actually liked.  Aircon worked well and although we had no view we had a small balcony overlooking the service area that was good for drying some clothes. Bed was a true king size and very comfortable.  Staff were very friendly and greeted us each time we came in or out and breakfast was perfectly adequate.  The location was close to many restaurants and a short walk to the main tourist sites.  We had the hotel organise private transfers to and from the airport and we were pleased with this service.  I would definitely stay at the AVA…\n",

Location was terrific.... Few minutes to temple of Zeus, few minutes to Acropolis, few minutes to Syntagma square. The walking Street behind the hotel was awesome with some great restaurants and shopping. Just wonderful.  Only thing I didn't like or may be my feeling when I asked the reception to change towels in my room the same evening I checked in, I was reminded that they normally do the next morning and not the same day. That just doesn't make sense, though in all sincerity they did change but I didn't like the attitude at that time. Over all I would still recommend this place. Gagan\n",

The suite was magnificent and it had every room amenity you could possibly desire. The central location is perfect for sightseeing or enjoying all of the local establishments. We did not have an opportunity to eat any meals at this hotel, but the breakfast ( although not free ) seemed quite nice. This is a must hotel for your Greek visit.

It's nice to be able to use Hadrian's Arch as a marker when you need to get back home at night! We greatly enjoyed this hotel, and my only complaint (for which I won't deduct a star) was that it seemed to have a rooftop patio of some kind, but it was inaccessible while we were there--I assume they were renovating? I wish we could have enjoyed that space, but in all honesty, we were out and about in the city so much, we probably wouldn't have gotten much use out of it anyway.\n",

A good choice of breakfast items including hot items.

We had to change our booking due to a flight cancellation so had to change rooms mid stay. We spent two nights in a standard suite then a night in an executive suite. The extra price for the executive suite isn't worth it. It was an extra 90 euros and the only advantage apart from space was if you were going to spend a lot of time in your room which you hopefully wouldn't do while in Athens. There was a microwave, sandwich toaster and a larger sofa and extra TV. The shower was terrible , it was much better in the standard suite. This is an excellent hotel with great service and I would defiantly return.\n",

Location puts all major sites, shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance. Breakfast is plentiful and quite good. Staff is very helpful with suggestions and directions. WIFI is included and worked well. Prior to our visit, staff arranged for airport pick-up which was on-time and reasonably priced. Only slight negative was a smallish shower in an otherwise sizable bathroom. I would highly recommend AVA.\n",

Rooms are beautifully decorated and include a kitchenette with a fridge. The only thing in the room which I found uncomfortable was the bathroom, which was not sufficient for a suite for four/five people - rather small and combined with the lavatory. There were some street noises at night, but this is I guess unavoidable, given the central location. And the Wi-Fi connection in the room was very bad.

      "Review is :Had a wonderful stay at the AVA Hotel in February 2015. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The location is perfect for a 4 day stay with historical sites literally outside your doorstep. Their breakfast buffet was outstanding with hot and cold items including traditional Greek pastries. While they don't have a full service restaurant, there are hundreds of great restaurants near by. The room sizes are large and comfortable with a full service kitchen. You won't go wrong staying at the AVA!\n",

On arrival, we had some bubbly and loukoumi in our room, and we were also given complimentary tickets to the Acropolis Museum. What a nice treat! We also had room service breakfast our first morning and that was wonderful.  The room itself was lovely, spacious, with a little balcony and kitchenette. Breakfast was good, not a huge amount on offer but tasty and set us up for the day. Staff were all amazing, so friendly and helpful.  The hotel is in a great location, close to all the sights but on a quiet street. Would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Review is :If you're going to visit Athens, spend the extra money and stay in the old town, called the Plaka if I'm not mistaken. An even better idea is to spend that money to get a room with a separate living room, a kitchen and a king bed all included in the price and all within walking distance of just about everything. That's what you get at the AVA hotel.  The hotel is just a block away from the temple of Zeus's ruins and is a 15 - 20 minute walk to the entrance to the Parthenon. Syntagma square and the Parliament building are about the same distance walk in another direction. Even the legendary Monastiraki area and the temple of Hephaestus are within walking distance of this hotel if you are a good walker.

I will start saying that our arrival to Greece included one of the worst things a tourist can experience when abroad. We had our passports stolen. So, we arrived  to the hotel just to drop the suitcases and find our  way to the embassy and the police. We were welcomed by Mina and Vasiliki. Awesome. Mina took immediate care of us and really tried to help us with everything. During our whole stay, she was the kindest, friendliest and most welcoming host we have ever met.

Had never been to Athens before, and was considering one of the higher end SPG properties like the Grand B, but due to TripAdvisor reviews chose AVA. Very glad we did. Hotel is wonderfully located in the Plaka, away from the busy downtown scene. Athens is not very large, and we were able to walk to all the top tourist attractions.  The hotel was a 40 euro (with tip) cab ride from the airport. Room was ready when we arrived at 3pm, and we were offered an upgrade (for a bit more $) from the lowest level room to one which had a separate sleeping area (the higher two categories have this). Glad we did as the ability to close the door, putter in the kitchenette, and/or just read was invaluable due to some latent jet lag.  Breakfast…\n",

From the balcony the view in one direction is the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch the other.  The breakfast is worth it, and the staff was helpful with advice.  When Greek unions declared a national strike, though, the staff really showed its worth.  They recommended a travel agent around the corner to help with suddenly vanished airline reservations.  Then, they helped with additional nights until the airport reopened.  What could have been stressful turned out fine.  If you're going to be stranded due to a national strike, Greece isn't a bad place to be - and the AVA Hotel made it even better.\n",

I wouldn't normally complain about such a thing but it was in stark contrast to the rest of our trip and the reviews on this and other sites. I found Stavros on the front desk to be rather rude and offensive in his manner (Andrea was lovely) and our stay here was the low point of our honeymoon to date.

      "Review is :We read the reviews and booked this hotel and were very glad we did. Service was excellent and the breakfast FAR exceeded our expectations. Beyond that, the neighborhood of Plaka is the best. We've traveled to about a dozen countries and the Plaka neighborhood ranks very high and it is because of the friendliness of the Greek people.  This hotel is in the heart of Plaka and very well connected by the Airportbus or metro. If you are on the fence about booking a hotel, Do Not hesitate on Hotel Ava!!!! I almost forgot, complementary champagne upon arrival\n",

The room was very nice (although a bit dark), the staff were very helpful and obliging. The only problem was it was quite noisy as we were on the ground floor on the receptions level and near the staff office. I had to keep going out to close the door between our room and the reception area. But overall a lovely hotel and a terrific location. We would definitely stay there again.\n",

The views from the balcony to the Acropolis in one direction and Hadrians Arch in the other were sensational.  Everything, including a large number of excellent restaurants are in easy walking distance.  The hotel is elegant, quiet and very comfortable, with spacious rooms which include a well equipped kitchenette. The staff are extremely welcoming and courteous which sets the tone for the whole experience. We will stay again when next in Athens without hesitation.\n",

The hotel is quiet, beautiful-- a place to get the rest you need after a day at the Parthenon. A friendlier, more helpful staff than AVA's would be hard to find anywhere. We stopped at AVA following a week visiting multiple islands--another wonderful story for another review--and a prior week in Istanbul.  By arrival time, our bags were stuffed with soiled clothing of all types.  No longer needing so much stuff, we decided to ship it home. To my very pleasant surprise, a bilingual hotel staffer volunteered to accompany me to the post office.  It was Friday, late afternoon and long lines awaited us. But, he…\n",

We had a beautiful roof top room which was just under the Parthenon and looked out to Hadrian's arch.  The breakfast is not included, however we stayed and had an outstanding breakfast for 12 euros.  Anything you could want is on the breakfast bar with made to order egg dishes.  The juices are fresh squeezed and, of course, great coffee  It is in the Plaka district.  So many sites and great restaurants are just around the corner if you branch out from the hotel.  If you are going to Athens and want to stay in near the Plaka, choose the Ava.  You won't be disappointed.\n",

Our room request was to have the quietest room, which did not lend us a view, but about the only thing we did in the room was sleep, so that was not an issue.  The linens & cleanliness of the room made staying here a treat.  We were welcomed with a bottle of sparkly wine, on ice and does that make one feel special!

When you look out the front door,   you'll see Hadrian's gate and the Temple of Zeus to your left and the Acropolis to your right.  I booked an executive suite  which I really can recommend if you are getting over jet lag.  The separated bedroom allows you to putter around in the living room and kitchen area without disturbing the sleep of your partner if you wake up at 3am.

In my opinion it is over rated for saying its rated as the best hotel in Athens on this site.   The good things were: Location, Helpful staff. Free internet.   Negatives in general: Breakfast not free, or even cheap. Small rooms. Overpriced   Negatives Specific to our room. Small room and view of a wall/patio of someones house. Room was musty. Bed very hard. Small bathroom.   Would choose somewhere else next time for sure and would suggest looking around to get more for your money.\n",

It is in a street that leads up to the Plaka from the main road, but the room is very quiet, due to excellent double glazing. Our room was 301 on the top floor and had a separate living room, large bedroom , a kitchenette and two sets of doors that led out onto a large veranda. From here you had views of the Acropolis up one end and the Hadrian's Arch down the other. The staff are very friendly and helped with some excellent restaurant choices. Breakfast is a large buffet in a lovely room on the ground floor. This is a top class boutique hotel, with everything you would need. Stay here !!\n",

The location cannot be bettered: just a five-minute walk from the Acropolis museum at the foot of the mound.

We were able to open our window onto a small balcony and look up one end of the street to the Acropolis and the other end to the Arch of Hadrian, very impressive. The suite was very comfortable and lacked nothing, the breakfast in the sweet downstairs restaurant was just right.  Highly recommend the AVA.\n",

The location was perfect: just a few minutes walk from the major sites of the Acropolis. But what really made the stay outstanding was the service: the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, made great restaurant recommendations and bookings, gave us excellent advice on how best to spend our limited time, and made us feel completely at home.

They even brought us a welcoming gift of a bottle of sparkling wine. If I have a regret, it is that we did not have enough time to enjoy the facilities. This is a luxury way to \"do\" Athens. We had a delightful…\n",

      "Review is :We just returned from a 2 week vacation in Europe visiting a number of cities/countries.  I would have to say that Ava Hotel was the finest we stayed at.  All the way from location (walking distance from everything - historic sites, shops, restaurants) to facilities, room size, bathroom size, cleanliness, decor, staff, ambiance, wifi strength and of course breakfast.  I don't give out highest ratings often but I had no choice here.  What a great way to end our vacation.\n",

They brought us a tray of coffee and croissants, stored our bags, and gave us helpful hints.  The hotel is located in the Plaka area a few blocks from all the action and we were able to get in a lot in one day, including a great dinner at a restaurant (Daphne's) less than a block away.  The room was a suite with a separate sitting area and even a small kitchen.  Everything in the room was top notch.  And the price was right!! I would highly recommend the AVA and will be back without a doubt.\n",

There also was a kitchen corner so one can prepare a meal or breakfast I guess, just used the coffee machine though. My room had a balcony, which is great if you wish to light a cigarette because it is a non-smoking hotel.  However, the best part is the location indeed, right in the middle of the touristic district of Plaka, literally at the bottom of the hill where the Acropolis stands. If you are on a stopover in Athens for a day before flying further to some island, it is a great way to avoid traffic and lost time because you can hang around on foot to do some sightseeings.  From the airport, public transport is available : tube station is Acropolis, there is one interchange and it can…\n",

The location of this small luxury hotel couldn't be more perfect - only 15 suites right in the heart of bustling old town Plaka, and mere steps away from many important landmarks and museums.  The beautiful new Acropolis Museum is just around the corner on charming pedestrian Aeropagitou, which used to be a scary busy street.  This museum has a vast glass floor that reveals the ancient city below, which is quite a startling sight.  You just have to walk out the front door of the AVA to be immersed in all the glories of Athens.  The only time we took a taxi was to the distant National Archaeological Museum, which nobody should miss.  Our son and his family had a big suite, but my…\n",

The only problem we had was with the outlets - they are European and if you are from the US, you will need an adapter. That being said, my adapter wouldn't fit and the ones provided by the front desk staff wouldn't work either. It wasn't until late in the evening when my husband and I were enjoying a late night cocktail that the front desk lady/bartender/service provider asked if I would go and get my curling iron. She then sat on the floor with a box of adapters and tried each one until she found the one that would work for me. Now THAT is what I call excellent service.

Easy to walk to the Acropolis, the Museum, the Temple of Zeus, the Arch and stroll through the seemingly endless Plaka shops and restaurants. The rooms are very large with separate sleeping and living aeas. Rooms are quiet, we never heard a peep from the neighborings. Breakfast was intimate, but offered everything you can ask for to begin a long day of walking and climbing to the Acropolis. Staff was helpful with directions. Rooms come with kitchenett with microwave, refrigerator, coffee and tea makers, and small cooktop. Beds are comfortable. The only negative is the very small shower. No bathtubs. Really would stay here again.\n",

Couple staff, who without exception, go the extra yard to make sure we are happy with excellent execution of everything so far  After a hot morning's walk we were offered cold water and juice while waiting for our room service to be completed.  Breakfast exceeds my expectations.  So fresh, juices cold pressed while you wait.  Standard was higher than St Regis or 4 seasons.  Not a single item I tried I did not enjoy.   My wife and I are regularly frequent  visitors of 1-3 hat restaurants in Sydney.  Food was not complex but was just brilliant, fresh and well chosen.  Room itself is big, clean. comfortable.  The bed is a little low for me, which is my only negative.  Highly recommend\n",

Do yourself a favor and book the package with the tickets to all of the sites and the tasting (turned out to be one of our best meals in Athens.)  It's not really a tasting; it's a full on lunch experience.  No waiting in the long lines with the pre-arranged tickets; it was awesome!!  The breakfast in the morning is FANTASTIC.

We have been to countless European hotels in this category, and they all included breakfast. The staff was pleasant and tried to help when they could. We appreciated that. The hotel also is a little worn and could use an updating. One tip:  keep all valuables secure when taking the subway. We took it once, and only once from the airport, and as we were getting off in a throng of people, a guy tried to put his hand in my front pocket. Luckily, I caught him.

It is a small boutique hotel within easy walking distance to Hadrian's Arch, Temple of Zeus and the Acropolis. It is also close to so many cafés and restaurants that you really are spoilt for choice. The hotel itself in immaculately, and I mean immaculately, clean. I had an executive room with a balcony with views of the three sites mentioned above. The bed, pillows and sheets are 5 star quality. The air conditioning is powerful which is great as it was 36 degrees in Athens when I arrived. The space in the executive room was very impressive and contained a small kitchenette which I didn't use. The also have a mini bar and a room service menu. The whole…\n",

      "Review is :I didn’t have high expectations about Athens city center in terms of lodging and food  …. but I was wrong ! The Ava hotel is the perfect place to tour the Plaka area, the new Acropolis Museum (terrific), the Acropolis itself, the Agora (awesome, Socrates walked and teached there…)  ; the other interesting museums are somewhat further away (like the Benaki, which I didn’t like too much).  The receptionists were extremely helpful and welcoming, we had an executive suite and a standard suite, for 2 adults and 3 children. The additional cost for the executive suite is really worth it.\n",

We also walked to Syntagma sq quite easily ( we are a fairly active couple in our high 40's)  We did not get breakfast at the hotel, rather just walk out and there are a bunch of restaurants.  Our room was on the 2nd floor overlooking the inner courtyard. It was reasonably spacious, quiet and clean with a small kitchenette area. Room was a little dark perhaps due to being on 2 nd floor.  Overall would recommend the hotel due to proximity to sites and metro. Staff was reasonably ok but we are pretty tech savvy and did not need to ask me much.\n",

The property was unbelievably close to attractions and the suite was great. I arrived sick and the staff directed me to a nearby pharmacist who dispensed antibiotics and other medication.

The room had a small balcony with a pleasant view. Staff were lovely and helpful. The location was brilliant very close to the Acropolis. The only reason I am giving a less than outstanding score is because the lift was tiny and the alternative flights of marble stairs were difficult for my parents to manage. I know from their room they found the lift noisy. Also the hotel reception and downstairs breakfasting area is very small. Breakfast was basic but nice enough. There isn't a separate restaurant at the hotel so you can't have anything from room service and need to eat out (or in the room).\n",

This was due to a rather late booking on our part.  Breakfast was excellent.  The staff  was most pleasant and helpful. The 2 pc's available in a separate area off the front desk often did not have internet connection.\n",

      "Review is :We selected this hotel based on Tripadvisor comments and ranking - and we were most definitely NOT disappointed. The Hotel's location in Plaka is the best - right where we wanted to be in Athens but also an oasis when you want a break from the heat, hustle and bustle around you. The room was so quiet and peaceful.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They welcome you with a bottle of wine and many smiles. From the hotel you are in easy walking distance to the main attractions of Athens and the excitement and fun of Plaka. The room we stayed in was clean, spacious, quiet and more than we expected in every way. The bed was absolutely perfect for a good night's rest. They are never too busy to help with any directions or advice you may need. The breakfast each day was…\n",

The location is unbeatable, in a great, safe neighborhood (Plaka), walking distance to the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch/Temple of Zeus, several restaurants, the presidential palace and Parliament (for changing of the Guard), and the stadium.  (I spoke with people on our cruise who stayed in other neighborhoods, and we seemed to have the best experience in terms of location.) The pleasant staff provided a very useful map as well as excellent restaurant recommendations (check out Manh Manh for dinner or the Thissio View Cafe for a drink with a view!), and they were very helpful.

Based on excellent Trip Advisor reviews, we chose Ava Hotel & Suites.  Ava’s location is a huge asset – it’s steps away from tons of shops and restaurants, and a very quick walk from the Acropolis, National Gardens and Syntagma Square. The close proximity to Hadrian’s Arch also makes it easy to describe to taxi drivers, or easy to find if you take the bus from the airport to Syntagma. Free Wifi is also a big plus.

I had a sprained ankle while we were in Athens and we were worried about me walking everywhere but it was located so close to everything we never once felt far or had to call a cab to get anywhere.

The rooms are beautiful and spacious.  We especially appreciated the kitchen area in the suite.  We were able to bring back food for lunch and dinners from markets and restaurants (the portions are huge in Greece and often provide two meals) and prepare them at the hotel.

The location is excellent as you can easily reach on foot most of the main touristic attractions.  Our suites was very comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful.

We upgraded our room which was a little pricey but we were completely satisfied. The room was spacious and extremely comfortable. We had aview of the Acropolis and Hadrian's Arch on our large spacious balcony, a great place to sit in the morning and take in the breathless view. The location is right in the centre of all the sights and action but it is pleasantly quiet.The entire staff were very friendly, the one that stood out the most was Vasiliki, she was at our beck and call our entire stay and made us feel special. We included the breakfast when we booked the room and it was worth the money. In addition to the breads, sausage, bacon, cereal, yoghurt etc, there were a…\n",

From the airport pickup, so welcome after an eleven hour flight, right there as we came out (Yannis, so very helpful), to having a great checkin, and all the value addition - from giving us tips on when best to go to the Acropolis and how, on restaurants, on booking tickets for ballet, on suggesting that we keep the taxi the day we visited the zoo ( we would have been completely stuck otherwise), to arranging the early breakfasts the days we travelled - it was exceptional.

To be sure, this is a boutique hotel.  There is no fitness room, pool, restaurant/bar options, etc. expected in a large hotel. Cafe/breakfast dining area is basic. Breakfast, however, was fine.  The management/front desk was very responsive to email requests/questions sent prior to our arrival.

      "Review is :Back from our Mediterranean cruise, we are enjoying telling our friends about the great time we had.  The highlights of our adventure included the unique city of Venice, the biblical sites in Israel, the Athens Acropolis, and the AVA hotel.  That's right; our hotel in Athens for three nights at the end of our cruise is right up there with the other awesome memories from our trip!  The location was perfect as a starting point for our walks to the historical sites and the rest of the city.  Our executive suite was a huge, gorgeous room, with a balcony that we visited each morning for coffee and each night for a glass of wine.  Looking to our right we had a view of the Acropolis and to the left Hadrian's Arch.  The staff was wonderful.  All friendly and attentive to our every need.…\n",

      "Review is :What a place to enjoy a stay in Athens.  This 15 suite boutique hotel is a home away from home with generous size suites, great staff, and a fabulous location (don't even think about the Grand Bretagne or the King George or the Electra that are pushed by some travel agents). They may be great, indeed grand hotels but the Ava Hotel kills them for location, cost and (I'm sure), the personal touch  We had a street-facing suite with a view of the Acropolis to the right and Hadrian's Arch and the Temple of Zeus to the left. A small balcony enabled you to take in these views while people-watching below and enjoying a very inexpensive bottle of Greek wine , available from shops with a few hundred metres.In fact, everything you want to see and do in Athens is within a few hundred metres…\n",

Kitchenettes are well stocked, We had are own lovely veranda in one room, and a nice French balcony in the other one where you can see both Hadrians Arch and the Acropolis.  Close to lots of restaurants and shops.  The staff were very attentive and had Excellent customer service!! I will only stay here when I am back in Athens! The welcoming champagne was a nice touch!

      "Review is :I booked the Ava Hotel based on reviews from Trip Advisor. The comments were correct. It was a charming little boutique hotel in the Plaka Area within walking distance to all major attractions, excellent restaurants and great shopping.  The staff was exceptional with check-in and helped us with our boarding passes the night before our flight. We only got to enjoy the accommodations for one night before our flight to the states but our room was large, clean and the beds were comfortable. There was a kitchen area, which we did not get to use. They also have a nice lobby area and offer and excellent breakfast for an additional price. If your spending any amount of time in Athens this would be the place to stay, and it worked for a one night stay too. I would definitely stay here…\n",

The staff were always happy to chat and offer advice on what to see and to confirm onward travel details-the recommendation of a tiny Taverna in the alleys of Plaka  for a dinner resulted in one of the best meals of my entire trip!   This hotel is not a flashy, consumer hotel- admittedly the breakfast buffet is small but so is the hotel and that is the charm of the place. For me, what it lacked in big hotel amenities it MORE than made up for in personal touches (like a lovely bottle of wine as a welcome gift), and a sincerley warm welcome from everyone I met.

We were upgrated by the hotel with no charge, to a biggest suite at the highest floor with a great balcony and view of the Acropolis. The attitude from the staff of the hotel was great. A bottle of champaigne was waiting for us in the suite. The suite was very comfortable and nice. From the hotel you can visit most  of the attractions of Athens by foot. The price is a bit expensive, but for an excellent hotel in a capital city in Europe it is O.K. The only comment is, that the braekfast could be more rich. If we'll visit Athens again we'll sure choose this hotel .\n",

I booked a suite in AVA. The room is spacious and clean, well decorated. Staff is kind and helpful. Breakfast is good, calm and relax like home. The location of the hotel cannot be beaten. It's just walking distance to the Arcopolis and other famous attractions.   Below is the summary of Pro and Cons of AVA.  Pro: 1. Location is perfect.

The location in Plaka is perfect to view the monuments and explore Plaka and neighbouring areas and to make multiple trips to Acropolis and museum. However, the first thing that strikes you upon entering the room is that there are no views of Acropolis or any other monument from the room- you only see the private dwellings behind the hotel or the street. To this extent, the hotel claims are exaggerated. The elevator is very small and can take only two persons at a time.

Upon arrival, we chose to upgrade at a very reasonable price to a family suite room complete with balcony. When  on the balcony, there were views to the left of Hadrian's Arch and to the right of the Acropolis. The location was fabulous. We could walk everywhere - the Acropolis, the metro station (to take us to the airport), Hadrian's Arch, the Old Town etc. Some great restaurants, cafes and takeaway food shops were nearby. Reception was always friendly, helpful and obliging.\n",

The location is great and since we were only staying one night, it was very convenient. But the hotel promises views of the acropolis which is probably only the case from the roof; our room was overlooking the wall of the next door building, and the room itself is very average, an ok bathroom with a small shower. I would imagine that there are better hotels deserving of the #1 spot in Athens.\n",

The hotel is on a side street so is very quiet but only a two minute walk to shopping, food and a subway stop (Acropli stop on Red line),  It is also walking distance to many of the major attractions and is a beautiful spot which we found the best area of Athens.  Breakfast for us was an additional 12 euro each but was excellent.  Only negative was blow dryer in bathroom wasn`t working but they did have an extra portable dryer in the room.

A very sweet young lady, Mina, greeted us with great enthusiasm and bent over backwards to ensure that all our needs were met.  The location of the hotel is wonderful -- restaurants, attractions and shopping all within a short walk.  When the hotel emailed us in advance, asking if we would like for them to provide a private car service, we went back and forth on whether it would be worth the additional euros (about 15, I think).

To your left, you see Hadrian's Arch not a half a block away, with Zeus' Temple immediately behind it. To your right and up, you see the Parthenon and acropolis. If you walk to the end of the block, you start on a great street full of shops and restaurants that leads you to Monastiraki Square and Hadrian's Library. If you walk past that street you go straight to the entrance to the Acropolis and the museum. The hotel itself is everything a boutique hotel should be - quiet, clean, beautifully appointed rooms, staff who can tell you the best places to eat.

Because I \"liked\" them on Facebook we also got a free bottle of champagne which we drank on our large veranda outside our room. They gave us a great dinner suggestion within easy walking distance of the hotel. The location of the hotel in the Plaka is close to all of the sites and is n a great neighborhood.  They were also very prompt about answering my questions and reonding to my emails. This is my new favorite hotel!\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the AVA for two nights recently before heading to Santorini.  The hotel was just what we were looking for...a smaller, quiet hotel - close to everything, but not right in the middle of the busy Plaka area.  We checked in after our flight from the States at around 10am.  We were prepared for our room not being ready, so was a very nice surprise that it was.  The staff were very welcoming and helpful - giving us an overview of the area and making suggestions on where to go in the area.    We booked an executive suite and it as quite spacious with a balcony that overlooked the street and a view of the Acropolis.

      "Review is :The Ava Hotel is a boutique hotel located within easy walking distance of the Acropolis and many other sites in the Plaka.  We stayed in a regular suite with a full kitchen and a very comfortable bed.  The suite was large by European standards and very clean and well-appointed.  We particularly appreciated the fully equipped kitchen because by that point in our month-long holiday we were getting tired of restaurant food.  We could pop out to a near-by little shop for basic breakfast and lunch supplies and do our own thing.  We had the hotel breakfast the first morning, but that was the only thing about the Ava that was a bit disappointing.  The breakfast was very basic (for the price we paid)- the standard buffet fare - nothing different from what you would find at hotel chain…\n",

For a European hotel, the rooms (suites) are amazingly spacious, with a little kitchenette and balcony.  The staff are about as friendly and helpful as is possible.  They will arrange for a private car to pick you up at the airport, a pretty good deal at 50 Euros.  We were headed to the islands, but sad to leave.\n",

Syntagma is about a 15 minute walk and the New Acropolis Museum even less. Restaurants abound.  The staff is very helpful and friendly and the  room is very large.  Bathroom, while well equipped is small.  Our room had a lovely courtyard which we enjoyed.  There's also a small kitchen which we didn't use. Overall, very pleased with this property and it's perfect location.\n",

One time when I had to print some Chinese files, the staff was really trying all they could to help as their computer system does not have Chinese. In the end, we still managed to print the files. I am so grateful for the staff's patience and devotion in helping guests.  The room is very spacious and comfy.  We had a nice living room that we could had some quality time with our guests.

In fact, nearly everything is close to the AVA. If you love to explore the Plaka on foot, and other marvelous sites, this is a good place to stay. Mind that the shower (at least in our room) was a tad small, but that does not change my opinion of this excellent property.  And, too, the kitchenette was a real plus, as the breakfast @ 12 Euros is a bit pricey. When we come back to Athens, we will stay at the AVA again.\n",

After 43 years of overseas travel this hotel rates among our best experiences.  Carefully selected and booked for early May, Greek Orthodox Easter and the final few days of our 40th wedding anniversary holiday. It was an excellent choice and not simply because a bottle of champagne and fresh nuts were delivered to our room in time for pre-dinner drinks with a note, tied with white ribbon and thanking us for staying with them!  A perfect location with Hadrian’s Arch and the Temple of Olympian Zeus at one end of the street and the Monument of Lysicrates and a narrow ‘slice’ of the Acropolis looming large at the top end, visible from rooms in the front of the hotel.

Room wide enough, shower booth, easy to use, WiFi, welcome champagne. REGULAR SUITES is not facing the road, the wall of the apartment can be seen from the balcony.  However, the room to take the (buffet) breakfast is narrow. And not many types of cuisine. This Hotel is a renovated apartment hotel, I think the fragility of the cafeteria and can not be helped.  Acropolis Parthenon, Herodes Atticus, Ancient Agora, Roman Agora, Temple of Zeus, Handrian's Arch, Hadrian's Library, Plaka area are within walking distance.  Now, we will choose this hotel when I visit a trip to Athens.\n",

With the location of this hotel, I didn't get to do that because it's so centrally located for most all the tourist attractions you'd want to see. Upon arrival at the airport, we took the bus (number X95) to Syntagma Square, which is the last stop.  It's a bit of a walk to the hotel from there when you're transporting luggage but certainly doable.  The staff at this hotel is very cheerful and helpful.  Breakfast was OK but not sure I'd say it was worth the 12 Euro per person that we paid each morning.

I travel often for business and this hotel was a welcome relief from the busy hotel lobbies of the chain hotels. You really felt like you were on vacation.

The hotel location was also excellent with easy walking access to the major city historical attractions as well as an excellent selection of nearby restaurants and transport options.  The service was very good and extended beyond our stay with assistance given to return a few items inadvertently left behind. Overall this hotel represented a great location with great service at a reasonable price.\n",

The location was centerally located in Plaka and close to several of the major sites. We felt very safe in the area. The staff was awesome and attentive in everyway. They provided accurate information every time. We were particulary happy about the EXTRA EXTRA effort that they made to assist us in getting back a lost 35mm camera. We left the camera at a restruant in Delphi about 2.5 hours outside of Athens. They worked closely with the Vakhos  Tavern 31 Apollonos, Delphi 33054, Greece owners to get the camera on a returning tourist bus and then retreiving the camera from the bus station. I can't thank both the AVA staff and the Vakhos…\n",

The room was a bit smaller than we expected (we had a Jr suite), but comfortable enough. Service was excellent, both while we were there and before and after our trip. We only ate breakfast at the restaurant, but the menu seemed sort of limited - not a big deal given all the good food around the area, but just that the included breakfast may not be a good value.\n",

The staff are so helpful and friendly. The rooms are beautifully designed, large and impeccably clean. If you get the opportunity stay in one of the executive suites. The location is ideal, a few minutes easy walk to all the sites and sits on the edge of Plaka an area of quaint little streets with tavernas. I was a bit concerned that because the hotel was so close to everything that the noise level may be high, it isnt, the hotel has excellent soundproofing and sits on a quiet side street. I would recommend this hotel with its excellent staff/service to all. When I visit Athens again I will stay at this hotel. Thank you…\n",

Taxis routinely grouped at the end of the street by Hadrian's arch, so we could wander around and still find transportation to explore further.  We walked on foot to most everything we came to see:  Acropolis, Agora, Cyclades Museum, New Acropolis Museum, Museum of Archaeology.  But the hotel…\n",

We had worried a little beforehand about the location of the hotel in the touristy Plaka area  -- but that didn't seem to matter.

I couldn't see anywhere else as nice to stay so I did the relaxing beach part of my holiday first and the stressful city bit second, but I was really glad I did.  The hotel is amazing and seemed cheap for what you got - I'd paid the same to stay at the Sofitel at the airport and it wasn't a patch on this.  I stayed in a non-view room at the back, with a little balcony over an internal courtyard which was nice to sit on and meant we didn't hear any traffic noise.  In actual fact, the rooms with balcony views only look onto the rear wall of the acropolis, so although you can see the Acropolis, it's just a wall…\n",

The staff was knowledgable & helpful about local places to visit, restaurants & all with a friendly smile!  The location of the Ava is perfect.  It is right in the middle of the Plaka & on our street-side balcony we had a fantastic view of the Acropolis.  We travel quite frequently & I am very picky about cleanliness but I would say this hotel would definitely be in my top of places to stay.  I can highly recommend the Ava & would stay there again if I ever get the chance.\n",

For our second stay we were in a Regular room right across the hallway from our first room. Compared to the much more expensive Exclusive Suite, the Regular room was not as large, had no separation between bedroom and living area, and lacked the enviable view from its much smaller balcony, but taken on its own merits was elegant and still spacious. Both rooms had kitchenettes and well laid-out bathrooms with high-quality shower stalls (not baths).  The beds…\n",

It was the perfect location with extremely attentive staff (somewhat of a rarity in many greek hotels) and outstanding service. We occupied the exclusive suite  which had an enormous terrace overlooking the acropolis to the right and Hadrian's Arch to the left. We were gobsmacked. The suite was luxurious and tailor made for a family of 5. Not enough superlatives to describe the furnishings and fittings. Do yourself a favour and book it. Yes it's a bit of a splurge but it's perfect for taking a short break (and a siesta!) in the middle of a hot summer's day whilst sightseeing. You do not want to be out all day in that heat wave! It's a hop skip and jump away from everything you need to see…\n",

Here is what he liked: He loved the room specifically the balcony with the view of the Acropolis one way and the Temple of Zeus the other,  He loved the wifi connection, He loved the breakfast staff and choices and he loved how close we were to the Plaka. So there, from my 10 year old to you.  Check it out and enjoy!\n",

After one day travelling and with a jetlag of six hours this confortable hotel was all we needed. The room and bed are big and really confortable and clean. Delicious breakfast and they even offered fresh orange juice and a variety of coffees. The location is perfect! Right in Plaka were you can walk to the Acropolis area and around the neighbour. But if you want to take the subway it´s just two blocks away. Reception was very gentle and recommended excelents restaurants everyday! We were very thankful for their help! Although we had a great experience there, we must say that the shower is very small. With such a spacious room and bathroom it could have a more in the shower too.\n",

The location is excellent on a quiet street by the Plaka but yet 50 meters aside from the main flow of tourists.   We were upgraded to junior suites, which were extremely comfortable and decorated with taste - the painted ceiling in the bathroom impressed us in particular! The morning breakfast is very good, and all the staff was very pleasant, as we found is usually the case everywhere in Greece!   This is where we will stay again next time we return to Athens!\n",

The staff at AVA cannot do enough for you on arrival a welcome water while checking in and then a fun trip in their tiny elevator to our floor the staff brought up the suitcases of which we had four.  We took 2 exec suites and the pure joy of standing on the balcony with Hadrians Arch one way and Acropolis in the opposite direction was like being in a movie.  You can walk all around the old town and enjoy the cobbled paths excellent tavernas, and be able to access the above sites in a short stroll, the breakfast is buffet, it has all the cereals, fruits, eggs, bacon, tomato, toast pastries, yoghurt…\n",

They even had a basket of fresh oranges and a juice squeezer available! The people working in this hotel are lovely, very welcoming and helpful.

Our rate did not include the breakfast buffet, but we opted to experience the many restaurant choices nearby instead.  We did pay to have chocolate in the room (to surprise the kids) and it went over fantastic with them.  We also had a bottle of wine waiting for us because we \"liked\" them on Facebook.

      "Review is :Only 10 minutes walking from the acropolis site and right by andreanou street where you can find  tourist shops and Greek restaurant. It is ideal to walk around the plaka. I had a very quiet room on the back alley, no view of the acropolis from the room balcony but I enjoyed the quietness. Nice big bathroom for Greek standards and comfy bed. Nice breakfast. I'm not a fan of the carpet in the room but it was clean. As for value, I find Athens hotels expensive in general, maybe missing some competition to bring the price down!\n",

(Also, prior to our arrival, I had emailed the hotel inquiring about a car transfer between the airport to the hotel.) I had a reply email back from Maria, the hotel manager, within one hour! She arranged an airport transfer with a charming man named Yannis (it was in his taxi). He met us outside of baggage claim with a sign with our name on it. WHAT A NICE PERSON!

When we returned in mid-afternoon we were told that they had a cancellation for one of their nicest rooms with a wonderful balcony, and would we like it for 25 Euros a night extra.  Of course.

Our guide dropped us off, and commented that he had heard from several of his other customers that they had a wonderful room. We wholeheartedly agree. We had not one but two bottles of chilled champagne and chocolate covered nuts waiting for us in our room thanks to an AVA promotion through Facebook and Expedia!

However, if luxury is what you are you looking for - this is not the place that comes to mind.  It is functional, clean and close to everything.  It does need a little bit of a makeover. We stayed in by far the best room they offer, but, felt like it could be a lot better.  Another tip, dont spend more than a day in Athens and you can walk everything if you are staying at the Ava or the Grand Bertagne.  Spend more time in the islands vs. within the city.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at AVA hotel on the front end and back end of a trip to Greece recently; read the trip advisor reviews and made reservations over the internet. The hotel staff responded promptly to all queries and were very helpful. Since we were traveling with our 2 college-age children we reserved the family suite and we were delighted with the accommodations. I suspect it was worth every penny and the room was laid out very nicely and the balcony was huge and perfect.  We arrived to find the sofa bed all ready with a rollaway in addition; the separate bedroom was very nice. Although the bath is small, it worked well; the amenities were nice.  We were in awe of the breathtaking view of the \"back side\" of the acropolis off the balcony-it was quite spectacular at night and we came in…\n",

I've never been compelled to to rate a hotel SO highly.From the moment we arrived to check-in to the check-out, we have been treated royally. Nothing, but nothing was too much trouble for the staff. They have been invaluable in helping us with plans to maximize our week here. From restaraunt recommendations to shopping and tour advice they have exceeded my expectations. Truly exceptional service is now a scarce commodity in the hotel industry. My stay at the Ava is reminiscent of the \"old days\" when the customer was King (in my case, Queen). I would advise anyone, whether coming to Athens on business or for a holiday to cosider the Ava in their travel plans. You will NOT be sorry.  They…\n",

With Hadrian's Arch 100m away, the Acropolic Museum, a 10 minute stroll away, and Stygmata Square, a mere 20 minute walk, you cannot beat this beautiful 'home away from home' for location.  Public transport including bus, tram and taxis are minutes away.    What really struck us, however, from the moment we arrived, was the friendly and  accommodating English speaking staff who went out of their way to make our stay memorable.  Their service, and care whether it was providing restaurant advice, or organising a tour, has been the foundation from which we have built many fond memories.    Each room has an in-house self-published booklet on Plaka,…\n",

Andrea's (think I have the right name) big smile over breakfast certainly sets your day off to a good start, and the same goes for the rest of the Ava's staff.

We purchased the breakfast package and were pleased with our meal. Restaurant staff was even more attentive. GREAT location and fairly easy to get to. We took the Metro from the airport with no problem. Our only issue was with directions given to a tavern we had a\"tasting\" arranged with tickets we bought as a package from the hotel. It was not where they told it would be, we ended eating elsewhere. Language barrier I guess. We did find later that night but not near location given. I will stay next time in Athens.\n",

The suit was fantastic, with a lit, domed ceiling in the small but clean bathroom, a huge private patio with furniture, a beautiful and comfortable bed and great travel books.  We slept in one morning and had to leave too early the next day to enjoy the free breakfast that came with our rate but the area looked comfortable.

But that it was going to be perfect, without finding any mistake or hiccup, was something I never thought to experience in my life.  Being a 5*-cruise ship hotel manager myself, I know how hard it is to run a perfect hotel.  A short sum of what impressed me the most about Ava Hotel Athens:  1. The cleanliness of the suite. Staying in a suite with a kitchenette that I used frequently, and keeping it as clean as they did....an amazing job! 2. The politeness of the Night Auditor. It doesn't happen often at front desks during night hours that the Night Auditor stands up from his chair just before you approach. Very polite! 3. The service of the front-desk staff.

They were also very helpful in recovering a piece of luggage from the airport that the airlines had lost.  Overall, this was one of the best (if not the best) hotel experiences we had.  Our kids (14 and 11 years old) also loved the place (and all the Greek books in the room which explained a lot about the history of the city).  A great hotel in the heart of Plaka!!  My highest…\n",

What we like about the hotel:  1) The room is spacious and with a small kitchen (for heating your meal...not for cooking). 2) Location: it is walking distance to Acropolis, Plaka and the main shopping street Ermou. 3) There are several restaurants (including Daphne) within walking distance from the hotel. 4) Friendly staff.  Breakfast spread was typical...but the staff was helpful ...offering to make waffle.  The complimentary sparkling wine was great.\n",

I was in Athens for only two nights before a cruise, and the hotel was perfectly located for my plan to see the new Acropolis Museum and the Old Agora. I was frankly a little surprised when I got to the hotel because on Tripadvisor it looks much nicer, bigger and more sophisticated. And it looks like you can see the Acropolis from your room or the roof. Neither is true. However, my room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is OK, but it's always uncomfortable taking a shower in those tiny little corner stalls, which is what they have. The breakfast was a good continental one, with some delicious Greek breads. I am surprised that this hotel holds the No. 1 spot at Tripadvisor. It's a nice little hotel, and I…\n",

The Acropolis museum is a couple of minutes' walk away, and you're in the the heart of the Plaka area in  no time.

When planning my trip to Athens with my wife I took a bunch of recommendations from my Athenian friend (many in the top 10 on Tripadvisor), but opted for this hotel instead.  I forfeited a swimming pool too (big big mistake in the Summer).  I found the website glamorised the hotel a little too much (it is very very plain).  The bathroom was absolutely terrible (shower barely worked, and was TINY).  I am tempted to give this hotel 1 star due to the huge gap in expectation, but for what it is, and because of the location (only thing going for it) I will keep it at 3.

Overall, I was quite satisfied with this hotel and generally agree with the other travelers' reviews.  For one thing, it's very convenient to the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum, situated right across the street from Hadrian's Arch.  It's also only about a 10-minute walk (15 minutes for slow walkers) from Syntagma Square, the heart of Athens, and only about a 5-minute walk from the Akropoli metro station, whence you can get just about anywhere in Athens with maximum one change of subway train.

The extensive space allowed my husband to be in one room napping or using computer or watching TV and me to occupy the other having a yoga practice or using the computer.  At this point we'd been in Greece about two weeks and a day of down time was actually welcome.

Big mistake taking the Metro. We each had 2 suitcases and had to change trains and continually locate an elevator for my mother, who also fell and miraculously was not injured. When I bought the tickets for the Metro, I was warned to be careful. Later, someone had unzipped my Mom's pocketbook and then removed her wallet halfway when I saw it. When we exited, we were sent the wrong way by 2 passerbys and headed to the Acropolis museum. After we asked a police officer, a helpful man with an Iphone and a man in a booking joint, we made it to the hotel exhausted and hot. (However, if you only have one…\n",

They smiled and greeted us every time we returned to the hotel.  They made us feel welcome.        We stayed in a Regular Suite.  The bathroom was comically small.  We actually laughed.  The room itself was large, so it was surprising.  Avoid staying on the same floor as the lobby if possible.  The noise from the lobby made sleep difficult.  We learned to leave our hood fan running to create some white noise.  They charged one night to my credit card a week before we arrived, so they're obviously very strict on their cancellation policy.

Most of the historic sites, museums and shopping areas are within walking distance. The metro is also a short walk away. The staff were friendly and helpful at check-in and sent us a bottle of champagne and chocolates once we settled in. We had an amazing view of the Acropolis, Hadrian's Arch and the Temple of Olympian Zeus from our balcony. Our suite was large, modern, clean and very quiet. We had breakfast two mornings and the selection of foods was quite good - eggs, cheese, cereals, bread, fruit, veggies, juice, coffee and more. I don't believe the restaurant is open for dinner.

The staff were without exception charming, efficient and helpful, and were happy to recommend local restaurants (every recommendation was a winner!).  In short, I can’t think of a single negative thing to say about the hotel.  I’ve visited Athens on many occasions, and the AVA is certainly the best Athenian hotel I’ve ever stayed in.\n",

Staff was very helpful and advised a good restaurant, where we had dinner the same night. As far as the prices are concerned, I think the hotel is overpriced (260 euros per night), but this seems to be a general problem with Greece. They entered the EU and their prices have flown up while the quality of the things stayed the same.\n",

Ideal for a few days stay. Not sure those rooms facing onto Lyssikratous Street would be worth paying extra for unless they are slightly larger and maybe you are travelling with children. Breakfast choice was reasonable value at 12 euros each, and all the staff without exception were charming. Location cannot be beaten in this city and on arrival and departure its easily walkable from / to Syntagma Square metro or bus stops direct from airport. Deserves to be no1 in Athens.\n",

The rooms are spacious and let you relax after a busy day touring through Athens! We also enjoyed our little balcony as well. The customer service was outstanding. Everyone was so friendly and helpful, especially Yiannis and Dimitra as they helped us get over losing our wallet due to a pickpocketer by finding us restaurants that accepted our one remaining credit card and making sure we would still be able to enjoy our time in Athens.

Also, 350 Euros (USD $500) per night for two adults and two kids is expensive compared to comparable hotels in the US.    Additional words of advice to travellers in Athens (unrelated to the Hotel Ava):   1) Beware of the  Taxi Drivers.  We caught 5 taxis and 4 of them tried to con us.  They call up a friend who speaks english and the person tells you a tall tale about why the taxi ride from the airport to Athens will cost 55+ Euros instead of the clearly posted 35 Euro flat fee.

Pics of the room tell the whole story.  Friendly staff and nicely appointed rooms with excellent Air Conditioning.  Only consider Grand Bretagne if you need a swimming pool, bathtub and butler service.  Otherwise, AVA Hotel is your best option.\n",

We opted for the exclusive suite and was not disappointed.  We did pay just over 2000 Euros but it was worth it.   I had been contacting the hotel by email prior to arrival, asking for directions, room contents etc and they were always very prompt at replying and very informative.  I also asked for a surprise for my husbands birthday - i went for the sparkling wine & chocolates which was a bit steap at 45 euros when it was only Asti (that costs about a fiver at home) but it was still a nice touch.   We took the bus number 95 from the airport to Syntagma Square…\n",

It was perfect for what we needed.  Plush, comfortable bed, roomy with the benefit of a kitchenette, and it looked out on an internal space with the most magnificent bouganvillea in full flower.  The room was light and airy, clean and comfortable.  The only niggle is the shower, which is very small - if you're seriously overweight you'd have to leave the door open!

This hotel was in a perfect location to walk to Syntagma to see Parliament or catch a train anywhere in Athens, or to walk to the Plaka.

The staff were extremely friendly.  We arrived too early to check in, so the staff held our bags and we found them later already in our room after we had checked in.

The hotel was just that - perfectly located with good standards without being stuffy so we never felt out of place in our casual gear. If we ever go again we would come back to this hotel.\n",

Had to stay in a more junior suite on the ground floor the first night which though comfortable, had a bathroom and especially a shower cubicle which you couldn't wash a cat in, let alone swing one. Things looked up thereafter when we moved up a couple of floors to a bigger suite with better sized bathroom and a balcony with views of nearby, ancient ruins. Despite being in the thick of things it doesn't come with the usual, impersonal, \"next one please\" attitude. It's relatively small and the staff are affable and make an effort. It's staggering distance from more bars and restaurants than you could shake a stick at and the hotel is happy to pass on guest recommendations in this regard. Breakfast is more than adequate and overall, I…\n",

It's hard to do better, especially for the money.   However, just to be accurate, it's not a five star hotel. The bathroom is fairly small, I could hardly move in the shower. The bed was made, but not changed each day and the lighting was fairly dim, making it difficult for us older people to read. The restaurant serves breakfast only and is more a buffet than restaurant  However, it ranks up there with one of the great finds that I've made through Trip Advisor. A quality small hotel that…\n",

Our recently remodeled room brought a sense of freshness and modern design as seen through the nicely decorated bathroom along with the warm and welcoming designed kitchen and the living room.      The service was outstanding. Specifically, Olga was very informative in regards to all the surrounding territory.  She helped us make a few reservations while keeping us pampered with her day-to-day attention.   Breakfast is another thing to mention. Very simple and yet incredibly delicious food that reflects the great Greek cuisine.  We would definitely return to the Ava Hotel.\n",

The location was perfect for this occasion but would be ideal for any visit to Athens. The standard room was large. Having the kitchen area in the room was a big plus. These rooms have a fairly small shower but I understand the executive rooms and suites have larger baths.  The cleaning staff kept my room spotless. The front desk staff was always at the desk and always very helpful. Great job AVA! I’ll be back!\n",

In the beginning, we stayed in a regular sized king bed room, but when we came back, we were able to upgrade to a suite due to the hotel having some cancellations from the volcanic ash problem in Iceland. The pics in my review are for the suite, which was really nice and roomy, but the regular suite is also very nice and spacious.  The bathroom shower is a little small, but it's plenty fine for a couple of days. Having stayed at a total of 5 hotels during my trip, I can say that the Ava's breakfast is the best one out there, and very reasonable in price.

Excellent amenities, spotlessly clean, very friendly and helpful staff and thebest breakfast we had on the entire trip.  Our room did not have a great view as some have mentioned but it really did not matter as we were out all day and only returned after dark.  The bottle of champagne and chocies on arrival was a nice surprise.  My one complaint was that breakfast was a little late (8 am) for early risers who wanted to get out and about early.

And the hotel was quiet and immaculately serviced with extremely friendly staff.  There is no nighttime restaurant in the hotel but who wants one when there are umpteen tavernas on the doorstep, some providing authentic Greek cuisine. Neither does the hotel have a swimming pool or gym. Hey! If you want a swim Piraeus is only half an hour away and you can have a dip in the Aegean Sea.

But we liked the clean and cozy room of AVA generally. A little pity that our balcony was not by the road side but the opposite... A kind reminder- do make sure you book the right dates if you do it on their official website. Cause if you return to the initial page in the middle of the operation, the date will change to default ones again... and we were charged half day rates for non-show...

Great information in the room including a short list of local restaurants with some indications of price & menu as well as being marked on a local map.  The location is right in the old section and the major sites are within a few minutes walk.  The location was nice a quiet at night.  A very special experience..\n",

The suite (executive apartment) was spacious, beautifully decorated and with all amenities advertised.  The staff is superb, going out of their way to be helpful and breakfast (included) was wonderful. Location in the Plaka is wonderful.  We would never consider staying anywhere else when in Athens.\n",

We had only 1 night in Athens, as we were leaving for the islands early the following morning, and wanted to stay close to the Acropolis for obvious touristy reasons. This hotel exceeded our expectations in terms of location and service. Everyone at the hotel was exceptionally kind and helpful, and they easily accommodated our request for an early breakfast. The rooms themselves were very clean, newly redecorated (if not necessarily to my taste) and the kitchenette was such a nice bonus to have for bottled water in the refridgerator etc.\n",

The rooms are tastefully done and the beds are out of this world comfortable.  The apartments suites would certainly make it very doable to spend a few days and do a little meal prep. yourself.  There are wonderful restaurants within walking distance, and the hotel staff are very helpful with regard to directions and reservations.  As Athens has a very active night life, for both tourists and locals, if we had the time back we'd had selected a restaurant and made a reservation in advance.  We ended up wandering around looking for a restaurant which resulted in us eating at a place we might otherwise not have chosen. …\n",

      "Review is :Tripadvisor comes through.  We picked this out based on the reviews and the space for 2 adults and 2 kids.  Amazing location on the edge of the Plaka district, close to the Acropolis and Hadrian's Arch, steps to shopping and restaurants, just off the main thoroughfare which makes it quieter.  We stayed in their large and lovely apartment (\"AVA Suite for 3 nights\"  and \"Executive Apartment\") to bookend our trips to the Greek Islands.  Beautiful accomodation and great service. great breakfast.  I like the small feel, too.  Both apartments were great, but in the heat of July, we didn't get much use out of the larger balcony in the AVA suite.  The only thing I could have wished for is a swimming pool.  This place is not cheap, but it is high quality. If you're not on a tight budget,…\n",

      "Review is :This hotel was our first stop after the airport and an eleven hour flight from the States. My wife and  I were celebrating 25 years  together, and it was our first trip abroad.  The reception and treatment that we received here far exceeded our expectations, as we heard that service in Greece was lacking.  This turned out to be not true.  We were met with friendly faces and helpful employees, especially Yannis at the front desk. His help was fantastic, his advice was correct about restaurants and sites to visit, all the while maintaining friendliness and professionalism.  When I hear people say that they want to be the best at something, I always listen with my eyes to see if they are willing to act on these wishes.  Rarely do the actions match the words, but here at Ava, they…\n",

Everyone spoke English and were very helpful in choosing excellent restaurants with perfect views. All the major sights were down the street and major shopping around the corner.  I would never consider staying anywhere else in Athens.\n",

Not bad at all.  Sound proof windows made sleeping easy.  The room was very well appointed (even a Blueray player in the room).  Beautiful modern bathroom (shower, no tub).  Very good free WiFi.

We had a first floor room with a patio....no view but a great place to have coffee.  The room had an almost full kitchen and would have been quite nice for an extended stay.  We were only there a night.  Daphne's retaurant is just up the street 1 block and should also not be missed.  The next morning we had coffee on the patio and when we came out to check out getting a cab to the airport we found that they were holding cleaning up breakfast for us.

Even though there was a Metro strike going on through our entire stay, it didn't affect us one bit. All the attractions were well within walking distance, especially the Acropolos. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was satisfactory except the bacon could have been cooked a little longer, the scrambled eggs a little shorter and the cocktail weenies...well, as an hors d'oeuvres that would be acceptable...not as a breakfast meat. All in all, a terrific establishment.\n",

First the location is perfect - one block from the Plaka and within easy walking distance of Ancient Athens, As you walk out the front door can look to the right and see the Acropolis and to the left and see Hadrian's Arch. Second the accomodations are up to date, spacious and very clean. In fact our room and the lobby area had been remodeled since our last stay two years ago.

My room was larger than my apartment in Paris and equally well equipped with wifi, a desk, flatscreen TV and kitchen. Athens is a place to go out, but it’s a relief to know that you don’t have to, that you can stuff up the fridge and stay in when you’re tired.

All the staff were excellent; friendly, helpful and quick to assist us with our requirements and requests for local knowledge.   We had a suite on the 3rd floor - clean, comfortable and welcoming - with a sunny balcony from which we could see the Acropolis and the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Housekeeping was excellent throughout our stay. For us the room was a little warm at night even after turning off the air conditioning - which was on 'winter' setting (perfectly understandable for late March). No problem, the hotel team rustled up two quiet but efficient fans in no time…\n",

      "Review is :Hotel has great location - near Syntagma Square, which is basically the centre of Athens. You can get the Metro directly from the airport to Syntagma then it is a bout a 7 minute walk to the hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room so spacious! I have stayed in Athens many times before and never known anywhere with so much room! fantastic! Also there is a mini-kitchenette area so you could prepare your own food too. We had a lovely outdoor courtyard which was great. My only tiny complaint would be that the bathroom was very small especially in relation to the rest of the room. However I would definitely recommend this hotel in Athens.\n",

It was the last night of our honeymoon and AVA made it a night to remember with an upgrade and a bottle of bubbly.  Well worth paying a little extra.  After several days on a cruise ship it was no nice to be in a suite with lots of room.  Many sights are within walking distance and the subway is very close.  I have no complaints whatsoever.\n",

We are in one of the executive apartments, which has a lovely view of the acropolis, and is delightfully decorated, complete with a walk out balcony, and small chandeleirs. Just a few steps away was Adrianou St, the main street in Plaka. We spent many happy hours strolling though the cobblestone streets, shops and quaint outdoor cafes bordering either side of us.

We were in the middle of the Plaka and all the major attractions were minutes away and great restaurants were around the corner.  The staff was so friendly and did not hesitate in helping in every way they could at all times.  Our apartment made our trip feel more like home than staying in a hotel. We had a balcony on the front of the hotel and we could see Hadrian's Arch to one side and in the other direction was the Acropolis.  The hotel had just been renovated and was immaculate.  They had their grand re-opening while we were there and what a nice party it was.  If you need it dark when you sleep, the Ava has that taken care of with great black out drapes.…\n",

      "Review is :In September 2009, my wife and I spent five nights at the AVA hotel in Athens.  Prior to arriving, the hotel was very responsive to our emailed questions.  The AVA is a small hotel with an excellent location on a narrow street between Hadrian's Arch and the Acropolis, both of which can be seen from rooms with a balcony.  We walked from the hotel to most all the highlights of Athens.  The rooms are very large complete with a kitchen and fridge.  We were able to go to a nearby grocery and purchase cereal, milk and fruit for our breakfasts as breakfast was not included with our room.  Our room was a suite so I could shut the doors to the bedroom and allow my wife to sleep when I was wide awake at 3 am.  A slight problem with the hotel (as with most hotels in Athens) is street…\n",

      "Review is :What a great hotel.  We booked on previous reviews here on Trip Advisor and it was spot on. We were upgraded to a renovated room  #203.  It had separate bedroom, living area and kitchenette,  bathroom, & 2 tv's. Champagne & chocolates were a nice welcoming touch. The location in Plaka is the best. We took the metro to the acropolis station from the airport and it took about 1 hour, maybe a little more due to all the stops and then walked to the hotel.(make sure you time stamp your ticket before getting onto the metro)  We took the taxi back at the hotel's negotiated rate of 35 Euros. The staff are wonderful and very helpful.  Our best dinner was at a restaurant in Kolonaki called Oikeio.  It was reasonably priced and good food.  Mostly locals. Call for reservation as they turn…\n",

Fantastic room with kitchenette, air conditioning, en suite, many lamps/bedside lights and doors out to patio where we sat having breakfast every morning.  Amazing staff - especially Maria and Iris on the front desk - they both recommended several excellent places to visit and Maria in particular sent us to two brilliant restaurants with rooftop views of the Acropolis.  Can't wait to go back and stay again.\n",

      "Review is :We read all the reviews before booking the AVA and amazingly they were all correct in the comments about this gem of a hotel. They have a philosophy to make sure every guest is treated like family. From the greeting by Stavos when we arrived in the evening from a long flight from LA to having arrangements for a price fixed taxi that they call to take you to the airport or port. (Much better than trying to negotiate the taxi fare on your own) We took the 95 airport bus to Syngama Square (buy ticket at the kiosk just outside the terminal door and remember to punch ticket in the machine in the middle of the bus).There is a large fine if your ticket is not stamped. Bus is every 10 minutes and you line up at sign that says 95 by the curb. Just a few feet from the Kiosk. (95 is right…\n",

At every moment the employees suggested great places to dine, which sites we should see and met our every expectation.  One day a member of our group had his birthday - the staff even delivered us a beautiful birthday cake!  This hotel has the ideal location of being in the center of Platka (for shopping).  We stayed in a suite on the top floor, we sat on our deck as often as we could with exquisite views of the Acropolis.  I was offered a less expensive rate at the King George and Bretagne, but from all we ever heard the AVA Hotel Athens was the place to stay ... and I will recommend this hotel to all my friends who go to Athens.\n",

This is a small hotel with excellent accommodation, we stayed in the very spacious executive apartment,  with stunning views of the Temple of Zeus and the Acropolis, from our balcony.  The management and staff were very helpful and informative and their recommendations and tips about, taxis, restaurants and Athens generally, was constructive and very useful.

Location was perfect -- walking distance to Acropolis, nice neighborhood, and the room was spacious, modern, great bathroom, and quiet for 4.  Hotel staff nice and helpful, but performed above and beyond service days later when our ferry to Santorini was cancelled.  We were stuck at the port, looking at a 12 hour delay, not knowing who to turn to for help when we taxied back to the AVA.  The woman at the desk saved us -- called a travel agent at home (it was both a Saturday and a holiday) and the agent booked us a flight, which salvaged our trip.  A week later, we were back at the AVA, grateful and relaxed, again enjoying the comfortable beds, friendly…\n",

You can see the Acropolis from most balconies and from the street entrance. Hotel is charming and staff extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and many rooms are large apartments. Hundreds of lovely shops and restaurants right out the door. We never left the area or took a cab as we only had 2 days before jumping on our cruise to the islands. Breakfast was a very nice buffet with nice Greek specialties.  Typical nice European type hotel. Not a resort hotel with Gym, shops and restaurants. etc.  They did a computer set up off the lobby with internet connection for free use with a limit of 15 minutes per use.\n",

Helpful staff, beautiful bathrooms, accommodating when 2 babycots were requested, and the baby linens were adorable! The room we had included a small balcony so my husband and I could relax outside while the kids slept. It's close to everything, and the kitchenette was quite useful for storing our baby formula and food, and heating water. The only difficulty was the parking. It doesn't have any parking lots near by, and it's almost impossible to find a spot to unload your luggage. This really isn't the hotel's fault though, as the hotel is located on a tiny street. The staff was very nice to help us get loaded fast so we didn't hold up the impatient drivers behind us! I can't complain too much though,…\n",

Breakfast was small but had a fresh and delicious selection that kept us going throughout the hot mornings and until mid afternoon.\n",

Not only is it calm, clean, and peaceful but because of the location we walked almost exclusively to the major sites and museums. Thus we avoid the \"chaos, noise, traffic and pollution\" that can be Athens and instead had a delightful trip.

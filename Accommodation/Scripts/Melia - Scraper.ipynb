       "<q class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>We enjoyed a four night stay in Athens in late October. We booked for 3 people and got an executive suite which was very spacious and comfortable. The room is ideal for families with children/ teens as there is one large king size bed and a double sofa bed. Each room can be closed off and has it’s own TV or can be opened up to provide a more open plan feel.  We felt the room was great for our needs.  The bathroom had an amazing jacuzzi bath that was very relaxing. The shower was also spacious. Bathrobes we’re provided which was nice for coming down from the pool.  The rooftop bar is a lovely space to spend time, we had some lovely poolside snacks and drinks and swam everyday and used the jacuzzi.

The steam room and sauna was also good. The gym looked small but looked well equipped and was every time we saw it, we didn’t use it so can’t comment on the equipment.  We didn’t chose to have breakfast as there were so many options nearby for breakfast. We had a lovely traditional Greek breakfast nearby in a side street with tahini, Cretan cheese and ham and honey with Greek yoghurt and coffee very nearby for 7 euros. We had a mother brunch another day nearby , there are plenty of options.  The immediate vicinity of the hotel looks a bit run down but you only need to walk a few minutes only and it is so well placed.  Even though it was near the metro , we walked everywhere we visited and only used a taxi for the airport transfer which was 45 euros.  Within walking distance is Monastiraki and Plaka - both lovely by day and night especially. The cafe culture is amazing and after visiting the acropolis we also visited a district called Anafiotika - which had some lovely restaurants!  A must is the restaurants on the Plaka steps - beautifully decorated with fairy lights and a great atmosphere with traditional Greek dancing.  All in all , we loved our stay in the Melia and would love to return one day.  We were also allowed to have a late check in as there was no one checking into our room immediately. The last day they kept our luggage and we were still able to use the pool and sauna and showers which was a bonus as we had a late flight back.  Thank Melia for a lovely stay !</span>…</q>"

      "Review is :I stayed a couple of times on this occasion - on the way to and from Crete, traveling via Athens. Probably my 12th or whatever visit to the hotel in recent years.  The room and facilities are very good. A comfortable room with good aircon, a decent quality bed and fast enough wifi. It's hard to expect more for circa 100 euros a night.  The 18m pool on the roof is a reasonable size for a city centre hotel. It's less crowded than the Grande Bretagne, for sure, and a quarter of the price. The view to the Acropolis ticks the box for something to stare at whilst doing laps.  I enjoyed an excellent poolside lunch most days, served by a helpful team.  I prefer to eat breakfast outside the hotel. the tiny cafe immediately opposite the hotel does great coffee, fresh squeezed juice and pastries and is run by a charming and helpful couple.  The team on Front Desk are great - always cheerful and helpful. I was grateful for an early check in and late check out as a gold Melia member too.  My only gripe is the pool-side music. Maybe someone went to Ibiza once and now thinks that \"Now that's What I Call Ibiza Chill 1993\" is all the rage. It's not. It's just noise.  The intrusive poolside muzak aside, a solid choice in Athens.…\n",

      "Review is :Really liked this hotel. the staff were attentive and helpful. The decor is fine and the rooms fairly well appointed with TV, Bar. We upgraded to a jacuzzi room which was a lot of fun. The view from the rooftop bar is not the best in Athens but the pool is nice and the bar convenient having just arrived from the airport. the breakfast was more than sufficient and plentiful offering both international cuisine and some with a greek twist. Short walk to the metro and taxis are plentiful. For me the only con was having to use your room card in the lift every time you wanted to use it. Other than that loved our stay here and would recommend.\n",

      "Review is :This hotel is located in a busy area, but it is within walking distance to the train and also some local restaurants and bars. The hotel does have a designated taxi which is convenient. The staff was kind if cold and not really friendly or helpful. The hitel had a decent lobby space and also had a pool on the rooftop with a outdoor bar area. The room was outdated and the whole hotel could use a remodel. If you're only going to be here for a few days it is acceptable. The hotel also offers complimentary breakfast which was decent and had a variety of things to choose from. I probably would not choose this hotel again un the future unless it was updated, as the pics on the website does not coincide with reality.\n",

      "Review is :For decades, I have traveled 100 or more days a year. In SEP-OCT 2022, I traveled for a month in Greece staying at 12 hotels (and on an overnight Ferry). In this context Melia Athens was outstanding. PROS: Excellent and cordial service made a difference, recommending great and inexpensive restaurants, helping book ferries and feeling that I had an Athenian friend. Super clean with daily change of towels. Sumptuous breakfast. Pretty swimming pool with bar. Very nice standard room CONS: Not close to attractions but location withing walking distance to Omonia Metro station. Get the Athens Metro card. Overall, I would not hesitate in returning to Melia Athens. Parting remarks: Greece is wonderful, except the touristic islands which were crowded even in October and I may skip them altogether next time. The Peloponesse resulted better than expected. Athens was safe anytime anywhere I moved, even after midnight. Travel light because not all hotels have elevators and in ancient towns you will climb many stairs and walk over cobblestones. Missing church number 59 was OK, sitting in a café watching people go by and doing nothing was fine even for hyper me.  I had a wonderful trip!…\n",

      "Review is :It's an old, outdated hotel. Raggedy towels that smelt moldy, excruciatingly slow wifi, uncomfortable dirty bed, tiny room (though we got the supreme room), smelly bathroom, and an ancient thermostat.  The carpet has stains everywhere.  If you need an iron & ironing board, you need to call.  If you need a kettle, you need to call.  There's not a lot of amenities in room.  No free water.  Need to pay for everything.   The layout of room is awkward.  Once we open the door, the desk is right in front of you.  We had to cram to the side to close door.  If the front door is open, it blocks access to the bed. If the closet door is open, it blocks the bathroom door.  If the bathroom door is open, it blocks the front door.  Just make sure all the doors are closed so you can move around in room.    The nightstands are two different shapes and sizes.  It seems like they went to the flea market and bought mismatch furniture.  No view.  We opened the curtains to see what's outside and saw and old, abandoned building that's falling apart.  Immediately, we closed the curtains and kept them shut.    The ladies, who delivered the iron and kettle to us, weren't in uniform so we couldn't discern if they were hotel staff or guest.  No smile nor greeting... Just handed it over and left.  We didn't even have chance to give them a tip.…\n",

      "Review is :Is this hotel conveniently located? Yes, a few steps from Omonia, crossing point of 2 of the 3 subways. 2 or 3 stops to Monastiraki, Plaka, Sytagma Square  and the Akropolis, a short walk to the archeological museum. Is it luxurious? Certainly not. The main weakness of the hotel seems to be \"not enough space\". Breakfast is crowded, food and dishes replaced unsatisfactorily. There would be larger rooms available on the ground floor, where the cafe and bar are closed and empty but probably there is also a shortage of staff. The rooftop pool and bar area is nice for lying in the sun but the staff is unattentive, in the evening we were not asked for orders for 15 minutes although we called the waiter 2 times, one finally came over and took the order while the other \"apologised\" in a very aggressive tone and gave for a reason that a Negroni would take some time. As we could not place the order the time to prepare it could not have been the issue and his efficient, blond bearded collegue demonstrated that a Negroni indeed could be produced quickliy. We had a first floor \"executive suite\", which was ok, a very nice and spacy bathroom, but with a terrace onto a backyard made of concrete walls, air-con units and a tiny square of blue sky very high above. Due to the milk-glass roof above the terrace and the high walls surrounding it, the room was constantly gloomy and needed full lights on even during a sunny noon. The name \"Diplomat suite\" was pure fantasy IMHO. The people at reception were very nice although also the 2 place reception is rather small and easily crowded.  You may feel protected by the police buses parked across the street most of the time, housing -with constantly running engins-  a squad of riot police.  Tip: Just around the corner in a little sidestreet is restaurant \"Stoá\", a simple neighborhood restaurant with good food, some fresh fish and friendly service (closed SUN).…\n",

I like to walk, so for me the location was easy to get around to all the sites on foot from. The price point was particularly good probably because it is not in the center of the city. The gym and breakfast area were small but attractive, and adequately equipped. The room had a nice shower but no coffee/tea maker. Unfortunately, It was a little bit noisy from the street traffic as well as the people in the room next store.\n",

The swimming pool on the top floor: an oasis of rest to tan and enjoy a cocktail or coffee, depending on the case, with views of the Acropolis, it couldn't be better. I do not give 5 points to my review, because the Omonoia area is not ideal, it does not have the soul of Plaka, however the metro is close and you can even walk to the most emblematic places in the city\n",

The location of the hotel in excellent, Omonoia Square is 3 minutes walk, also can have a nice walk to Syntagma Square,  Akropolis, Plaka or Monastiraki, all that small specific streets, 30 minutes to Kallimarmaro Stadium.

We were offered a upgrade for an additional cost, but we decided to stick with our original booking which was two supreme rooms. When we arrived into our room, we were impressed. The double bed was comfortable, had a good sized bathroom (it even had a jacuzzi) which was a nice feature and plenty of charging points. The disappointing aspect of the room was the TV. When I turned on the TV, there were no channels showing and was struggling to pick up a signal. Whilst this was quickly fixed by the maintenance team, the TV should of been checked before the guests arrived. Overall the room was up to a good standard. …\n",

However, it is honest of my experience of staying for 4 nights.    The Hotel is situated in a very poor area of Athens, it really made me feel sad as I had last visited pre-olympics (in 2002) and the whole city was so much cleaner and less poverty stricken back then.  I fear the impact of the refugee crisis and the economical decline has really caught up with the City.  There were plentiful gangs, drugs dealers in the local vicinity, people off their face on illicit substances and witnessed people injecting in the streets.  It pains me to say that the area/city appears the most deprived of any European City I have visited (and bordering…\n",

The room was pretty small for a standard room, and didn’t have enough counter space because of the minibar tray which seemed to be added as an afterthought.

Anna at reception was fantastic and went beyond to find us a private & affordable guide for the Acropolis the next morning. Who was sensational! The roof top provides a beautiful view of the Acropolis however our dining experience left a lot to be desired. We constantly had to ask for service, waited almost 30 minutes to get a drink. However other tables with other wait staff appeared to have very good service. My husbands meal when it arrived was delicious. I can recommend the deconstructed Moussaka.  The rooms are clean & lovely, bed comfortable & a selection of pillows. We had a spa bath which was most welcome after a day sightseeing. Air conditioner is great.

They were fully booked, so I decided to keep my room from the 11-13th and stayed at the Wyndham from the 9-11th. When I arrived to Melia on the 11th, I was so disappointed. It definently felt like a down grade from the Wyndham Grand Athens. I booked the basic room, at checkin I was told they gave me an \"upgrade\" free of charge. The room was so small and gloomy, I'm scared to see what the regular room looked like. The bathroom was nice. It included a stand alone shower and a jacuzzi.

This is not something that I have been asked for at any other hotels in my travels previously so seemed odd, plus I made the booking a year earlier, and I no longer had that specific card so that was an inconvenience, I would suggest the hotel change this procedure as my passport should be ID enough. The hotel insisted and had to refund the room cost and re-charge me on a card I had with me, I was not expecting this.

The rooftop sports a nice pool and jacuzzi. At night, they convert the pool deck to a restaurant (casual). Food is a bit pricey for what you get but it's worth it for the amazing view of the Parthenon lit up at night.

The pool bar is open all day and evening except for the hour that the rooftop closes to convert to the restaurant.\n",

The room was a good size, the bed was comfy and so were the pillows. The bathroom was big and the shower was good too.

On a warm summer night enjoying wine and a delicious meal while looking at the beautifully lit Acropolis. It just doesn't get any better than that! The rooms are very tastefully decorated in a light wood that I take as maple or another similarly grained tree and the beds are very comfortable. Likewise the halls are aso beautifully done in the same wood. ther are only two negatives that come to mind. The first is location. It is a good taxi ride to any of the tourist areas such as the Acropolis. The second is the bar and this is a strange one. when we were there the only bar open is the rooftop bar which closes at 6 pm and reopens at 8 pm. this…\n",

The carpets could be changed, and the rooms need an overhaul.  The staff in reception is quite inefficient.  They had problems with the electric door lock system when we arrived, thus were checked into our rooms without keys.  The hotel also had a problem with electricity.   The area is ugly, run down, and at night does not give a sense of safety.  And not many decent places to have dinner nearby, so basically unless you want to take a cab, you have to eat at the hotel.  In the day, you can walk to nice areas, but does not feel safe at night.\n",

Not the most modern looking rooms but who gives a monkeys when everything else is so in order. Got a late check out and could use pool and shower up before leaving. Nice rooftop pool but not enough loungers. Maybe 10 loungers and some tables and chairs. Probably 30 people up there at most times. Also, €4 a bit steep for a small Diet Coke!

I need to highlight the hotel staff- from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out they were friendly, helpful, kind, and went over the top to ensure we had a great experience. Starting from the check-in- they knew we had a long day of traveling and got us up to our rooms as quick as possible. During the trip, they helped us almost daily with calling taxis, giving us recommendations and overall local knowledge. For that we can't thank them enough! The rooms were on the smaller side, but overall very nice and clean with a huge window. I saw some reviews that it was dated but we didn't think that at all. The bathrooms were a good size and had a nice shower. Only complaint about the room is that…\n",

I did notice some other reviews referencing the area around the Melia Athens. It is certainly a rough crowd and some rough neighborhoods, but in general I felt safe during the day and had no trouble traveling to the airport by way of metro walking from the hotel. The room was comfortable. I reallllly enjoyed the Hammam that they have upstairs. Very nice space, great steamroom.

The neighbourhood was a bit confronting, with many homeless and drug users in the squares nearby in the evenings - but when we were moving after dark we just grabbed a taxi which cost us about 10 Euro.

Pre-check in until we checked out the staff and company provided solutions and answers to all my request. A few minor things but other than that the facility was exceptional. The location is great, everything was clean, the bathrooms were beautiful, but the regular rooms were a bit small in my opinion. We also had a suite, which was a great size. It allowed us to plan a day or talk after a day ended without feeling condensed. The sky lounge and cafe both provided excellent service, and the food was phenomenal. All the waiters could speak English, which made life much easier for us. Melia Athens is a smaller hotel, and we went right before peak season so I unable to talk about a stay during the…\n",

That evening, they still didn’t have a solution.

The issue was with cockroaches.   Every morning we had to kill one.   They aren't small  so they were easy to find.   The hotel offered to move us to another room but we had friends staying on the same floor as ours and they had cockroaches also - so moving to another room would not have resolved the issue.     Interesting resolution - they offered us a drink for the inconvenience of having the roaches.   Guess they figured if we drink we might not see them.  My suggestion - find another hotel.\n",

However, lots of central Athens is like that at the moment because of the financial crisis. The hotel itself is well maintained, the rooms are nice and the staff are very helpful. The best bit for me was the rooftop terrace which was still operational even in the autumn. The food there was great and the views over the city amazing. Our first night we were able to dine outside with a view of the Acropolis.   In terms of getting into town it's walkable from the hotel and the metro is nearby.\n",

The location probably isn't 5* but if u come out of the hotel turn right and take the first left that will take u up to the main square where you can catch the metro to anywhere u want to go. Make sure to visit the Palaka area...so quaint and is in the old town, bars and restaurants are fab.  There was a lot of army presence at night, we weren't sure what that was all about and we never saw anything bad happen but it does feel like the poorer side of the city.

The Melia Athens has very nice rooms and the bed was so comfortable that I was tempted to wake-up midday.  But that would mean missing a delicious buffet breakfast!  The only complaint I have is that I had to pay an extra 5 euros a day for fast wi-fi since the standard hotel wifi can't access anything.  They should just add this to the room rate to save the guest the trouble of going to the front desk at the end of every 24 hours just to activate the fast wifi connection.\n",

It’s a short walk to the Square where you can catch the hop on/hop off buses which show you all the sites. You can even get down to the beach if you fancy a day by the sea.

From the minute we entered this hotel, we were pleasently surprised with an upgrade to our room for free. We stayed in supreme room with jacuzzi and it was one of the best stays for us in a hotel. We felt it was very clean, modern, extravagant hotel with amazing top lounge views of Acropolis and Mount Lycabettus. We loved our breakfast and we loved it was from 6.30 to 10.30 in the morning! Location was perfect as well! After reading reviews of others, we were a bit concerned this hotel will be a bit far away but i couldnt disagree more!In about 20 min walking radius we could access all main attractions.

The front desk staff were English speaking and very helpful with confirming all transfers and flights.  The hotel is centrally located to walk everywhere, including the Plaka and the Acropolis/Parthenon.  The views for the rooftop restaurant and pool were simply incredible.  They even had a gym with views of the Parthenon while you worked out! The food and service were all top notch!  Stay here!!\n",

I wouldn't say it's super clean as you can tell the carpet in the rooms need a good wash and there were a lot of hair stuck when we first came in the room. The gym definitely needs an update or expansion as there's barely space between the machine and i'm sure they might be breaking some health and safety rules. Breakfast was not included on our reservation which we weren't aware and it was a bit pricey to add it at a later stage. Some of the reception staff were exceptional and others lacking knowledge. As I said, the whole stay was a bit so and so.\n",

Walking distance to two of the Hop on Hop Off busses which made it very convenient for our outtings and tours. The service is inpecable and room is very well equipped and comfortable.

The hotel literally sticks out like a sore thumb in the area that it is located in.  it's grand entrance, marble walls and spacious lobby are so out of place on the street it sits on, it's almost comical.  The rooms in the Melia are being renovated and we were lucky enough to get one of the new ones.  It was spacious, modern and very nicely appointed with modern furniture, linens and electronics.  The bathroom was also spacious and included a jetted shower, and jacuzzi tub, that, had we had more time in the city, I'm sure we would have enjoyed bathing in.

The showers were a bit odd - there was an overhead shower with jets further down. The pressure of the water coming out of them was a little too hard and hurt a bit.  People on other reviews said that the location was great, but we found a lot of things were closed close by (on a Saturday) so we walked for 10-15 minutes to find a restaurant for lunch.

The hotel is in a great location making it easy to walk to cafes, shops, tours etc.  We would definitely stay here again!!\n",

      "Review is :Stunning hotel! The rooms are super nice and squeaky clean!! I only stayed two nights after finishing up a tour and the other hotel was booked out, I’m glad it was because this place is luxury!! The staff are so nice and polite, something I hadn’t yet experienced in Greece!! The difference one star makes!!! The rooftop pool is amazing, you can sit in the pool and just look at the acropolis and take in how amazing the place is. I didn’t love Athens, but I loved the Melia, I’d be happy just to go to Athens for a couple of nights and spend all my time in the hotel!!  The little extras like a flower in a jar served with room service and a little bowl of chips when you order a drink from room service, the thought just makes your stay more enjoyable! Cannot think of anything negative…\n",

Rooms are of a decent size and the hotel is spotlessly clean. Pool area is lovely and the view at night is amazing although the opening times could be improved. Relaxing environment after the hustle and bustle of sightseeing around Athens. Breakfast is okay, nothing startling but there's enough to satisfy before heading out for the day. Great airconditioning in the rooms. Would definitely stay at the hotel again.\n",

The rooms are comfy and clean, the staff are all very friendly and despite a friend warning us that it \"wasn't the best area\" we had no problems - and everything was still within walking distance.  The only recommendations I would make to the staff is to watch out for people reserving sunbeds - there wasn't very mainly and annoyingly people would put their towels on them 1st thing in the morning and not actually use them until the afternoon. I also wasn't told that I would need to bring with me the credit card I paid for the hotel with (I prepaid 6 months ago) which slowed down check in.\n",

In case you are in a hurry you can take the Metro Subway from Omonoia Square to all the major sites in Athens. The location of MELIÁ Athens is very convenient for shopping. In case you need a meal there is a Restaurant adjacent to the hotel lobby. The breakfast provided with room is quite satisfactory. The Level Room was very clean and provided all of the amenities that are required for a restful and quiet stay. The Roof Pool is more than what is required for a hot afternoon refreshing swim.

The receptionist and porter were all very helpful and gave us plenty of information for get to about the city. As we arrived late and the restaurant were booked out due to the rain, for our safety concern the porter even walked with us to direct us to nearest eatery’s. Well done to the management for training their staff to be just that extra courteous. We had a 7 year old with us, even with an extra very comfortable (as said by my daughter) fold out bed and the rooms own king size bed the room was spacious for all 3 of us.  Bathroom is jet legs heaven .. Tub with Jacuzzi and Shower facet and body jet spray make this bathroom much more special than others. Hotel is walking distance…\n",

Friendly and accommodating staff. The doorman, Chris, was very personable, helping my wife and I orient to the city and surrounding areas of the hotel.  The pool on the rooftop of the Melia is a must experience at night - the food and drinks cost too much, but unobstructed views of the city and Acropolis make it well worth it! Food at small restaurants and street vendors is amazing, cheap (less than $10 for a pork/beek/chicken gyro and cold beer), all within 1/2 to 3 blocks of the Melia. Keep your wallets, purses, and cel phones double-zipped and out of sight, as pick-pocketers abound. Several cel phones were…\n",

      "Review is :Stayed just one night post cruise, so arrived quite early and was able to leave our luggage while we had a look around. The closest place of interest is the Archealogical Museum about 500m up the road. The Museum looked run down, scruffy, but inside, the exhibits were fascinating. It is a pretty long walk to the Acropolis tho. The hotel I found was good quality, and the staff polite and professional. We were upgraded to a large room with a spa bath, and comfortable bed. We only had a view behind the hotel but as we only were there one night wasn't a problem...and therefore didn't have any street noise. As we were tired in the evening we just ate in the hotel restaurant. I had a meal which consisted of 3 small burgers, chicken, beef and vegetarian. Tasty and a reasonable price.…\n",

The hotel is located in between Omonia Square and the National Archaeological museum, the area is not the prettiest part of Athens but it is safe and has lots of shops and bars close by, also some excellent restaurants that are not just tourist traps. The main shopping street is a short walk away, half an hour or so to the Acropolis entrance. The rooms were clean and comfortable, decent beds, some traffic noise audible in room but not too bad, air con worked, WiFi ok too. The pool on the roof was my main reason for booking this hotel.

Just two suggestions: seperate the dining areas for smokers and non smokers - with so much of the world becoming anti smoking and health conscious I am amazed that some hotels in particular haven’t acted on this. Which is my second small gripe as well, as we requested a non smoking room, but it still stunk of smoke. Follow the lead of Australia, the UK and parts of the US and ban smoking in hotel rooms and dining area. Thank you for the amazing service though and clean room and late check out.\n",

My room was like an oasis - cool, comfortable, and very quiet.   The rooftop pool was also a great way to spend some time in the afternoon when it got too hot.   Many people have commented on the location of the hotel from a safety standpoint, and while it’s not in the best part of Athens I had no issues. I walked from hotel to Acropolis and it’s almost a direct path (a few minutes from hotel the street ‘Aidou’ starts the trendier part of the area with lots of cafes and shops) and spills right into Monastiraki.\n",

The rooftop had a nice view & the staff was courteous.    Our family had 2 main issues - security & cost.  While sitting in the ground level restaurant two young boys (13-15 years old I would guess) walked in and came up to our table begging for money.  One put a piece of paper down next to me, after they ran off I realized he had stolen my phone.

We were able to check in early and check out late. Free WiFi. No complaints! Remember to book a transfer from the airport through the hotel where it’s $43 flat rate for a taxi. We took a private car from the airport to the hotel which cost us $100 and a taxi through the hotel on the way back to the airport. I would stay here again. Wish we had time to check out the spa.\n",

The staff were perfectly polite and the rooms were clean.  However, the corridor on our floor was quite dark and dingy. The lighting seems to be a little too low and the decoration seemed a touch dark and outdated. The room was quite small and the bathroom had a peculiar door that had an inch between the door and the door frame: this isn't always conducive to a romantic stay anywhere, let alone your honeymoon!  Whilst the location isn't the fault of the hotel, we realised shortly before arriving that Omonia Square is to be avoided on an evening as there is apparently a lot of drug use in this area. In fact on our way back…\n",

Proper pool you can do laps in, a few beds but lots of table seating and lounge area, great bar, extraordinary views all round the city. However, they close the pool at 6.30 to lay the tables for dinner; this is just the time you'd want to hang out with a drink. great place for dinner though.\n",

Metro was close and €10 per person to airport. Bus was less but not as close.  Taxi was €49 but more early in am. I would recommend this hotel if you are Athens.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed here (Melia hotel in Athens) for 2 night in May and we are very satisfied.  We  moved from different hotel to this hotel due to the cost.  The hotel has a very good breakfast buffet( hot and cold). This hotel is near Omonia Station .  You can walk there in 5 minutes to get food and drink or you can walk to shopping center ( about 10-15 min) where there are a lot of restaurant and shop. We walked around during the day and took a taxi back to the hotel at night because some areas beyond the hotel are a bit sketchy.  We definitely stay here again if we go to Athens.\n",

One of the pluses was the breakfast. I am a vegetarian and they had plenty of veggie options which was really appreciable. The location is also nice and close to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.   Three cheers for the hotel :)\n",

Don’t be fooled into getting a taxi to acropolis for 7 euros because it’s a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The meals are relatively better than the rest of the Greece. Pool is great. Best time of the season is June July August. Wifi is great. Staff is cooperative. There is a 3 euro tax per night as per the governments instruction. 45 minutes drive from the airport. Roof top is amazing. Drinks are overpriced but worth it. Rooms are lavish because obviously you have paid fancy for them.\n",

The room was very beautiful and clean, with a reasonable size, very comfy bed and a nice bathroom with a Jacuzzi.  The breakfast was very good as well with a lot of choice as English breakfast, croissants, salads, fruits, bread, Greek yogurts (the best) and a selection of juices, teas and coffee.  They also have a pool on the roof top with a bar and restaurant where you can enjoy your food or drinks with a stunning view to the Akropolis. The prices for the restaurant are not cheap as they serve gourmet food. Overall was a nice experience and I recommend to stay there.\n",

Greece seems unusually polite making it very friendly to travel. Around midnight a suddued group of 9 ate some baclava on the pool deck area quietly. We had all been buying coffee and drinks during the day but next an officious staff women rudely told us we cannot bring outside food to the private deck.

Our room was quite stuffy and after trying to turn the air condition on, with no success, we contacted the main desk. We were told the air condition was \"in neutral\" (meaning it was off for the entire building) and they would bring us a fan. They were quite prompt on delivering a fan to our room, however given what we paid for our stay, air conditioning is assumed to be available at any time.

Very friendly staff.  Nicely furnished room however with a major setback: the designer had the \"great\" idea to insert to vertical slits of windows in the wall separating the sleeping area from the bathroom. That means that whenever someone uses the bathroom at night the bathroom lights will also brightly illuminate the sleeping area. No problem in case of single occupancy but a big problem when occupied by a couple.  Having said that,  the bathroom itself is cleverly designed allowing you to use the bathtub integrated shower without risking overflow.\n",

When we arrived it was closed and when we asked at reception we got a response of \"it is closed and this is clearly communicated on the website\". This is completely wrong. No apology was offered.

Convenient because it's about 5mins walk to Omonia station and the route is pretty safe even in the night though it might be rough on your luggage. Taking Uber would cost you about €30 while taxi would be €43. No airport transfers though. Staff is friendly and helpful. When we requested for double bed at the counter (because Expedia didn't have the option to put in the request), though their hotel is full for the night, they offered to help us change for the second night. We only needed to pack our luggages and they shifted it for us the second night. Though there were some slight problems like clogged shower and non working air conditioner, they did solve it promptly for us. Room is comfortable, clean, and exactly as it looks…\n",

Breakfast offers a good selection, but for less then 1/3rd of the price you can get a breakfast with good coffee outside on one of the squares.

As we booked to go in December for my birthday it wasn’t that hot/warm. And this hotel had a rooftop bar/pool etc but we didn’t know that they close that section off over the winter times which we were very disappointed about as we wasn’t told at the time of booking that it would be off limits.

We both like to walk as much as possible so that we can really see the destinations that we visit and the location of the Melia was perfect. The beds are really comfortable and the hyrdomassage bath was a lovely surprise!

      "Review is :Stayed in the Supreme room, which was nicely decorated. Queen size bed which was very comfortable. The bathroom has a jacuzzi bath which is great and the shower is brilliant... Bathrobes were not in our room as advertised, and this was highlighted to staff, and I was reliably informed that these would be provided.. Unfortunately, this did not happen, but nothing serious, it just would have added to the bathroom experience... Room service staff are very friendly and always happy. Rooftop terrace with restaurant and swimming pool a lovely experience, with the acropolis in the distance (fantastic view at night).. We would visit the local supermarket (Bazaar) for drinks and snacks for the room to keep costs down...with regards to sight seeing we would take a brisk 23 minute walk to…\n",

      "Review is :This is a really lovely hotel which is central in Athens.  Initially we were unsure of the location as there was a lot of graffiti everywhere but we quickly saw that this is common place in Athens.  It was a very short walk to the Ommonia metro station and the hop on hop off buses making it very easy to get around the city.  The room itself was large and very comfortable.  The jacuzzi bath was great!  The breakfast was lovely, lots of variation.  We had dinner and drinks in the Sky Lounge and it was wonderful.  The food was delicious and the view of the Accropolis beautiful.  We also ate in Cafe Mondo which was also lovelt.  The staff throughout our stay were helpful and very friendly.  Would highly recommend this hotel!\n",

      "Review is :Although rooms are small with limited lighting and no bedside tables due to size, the hotel is well located in central area. If you don’t like graffiti or dirty streets chose another location as this hotel sits in a run down part of town where crime is issue. The rooms have not been well maintained as the carpets are filthy and worn. Keep your shoes on. Smokers are everywhere and seems like hotel let’s people and staff smoke anywhere they like. Strong cigarette smoke lingers in every hall and drifted into my room. Sad that there is such a lack of standards here.   They also do not provide in room coffee like most hotels and their drink prices much higher than expected.   Overall not a good deal but if the hotel tried they could be much better.\n",

We joined the Melia rewards program (free) and were very glad we had because the very nice receptionist gave us an upgrade to a suite because we were new members.  This was just an overnight stay after a flight from Manchester prior to catching a next day afternoon ferry from Piraeus.  It all worked perfectly - the hotel is an easy walk from Omonia Square metro.  We got the Metro from the airport and then the metro to Piraeus the next day - very easy.  We had dinner at the hotel on the top terrace with fabulous views of the acropolis - food expensive and not that good - would probably opt to eat elsewhere locally if we had had the time.  Overall a very good choice of hotel in Athens at a good price - breakfast buffet was good also.\n",

The rooms were clean, comfortable and nice, the staff were friendly overall so no complaints. Just a few footnotes or \"lessons\" learned for those that are coming to stay:  - The hotel is about a 20-30 minute walk to ancient Athens where most of the activities are centralized along with the sights and tourist shops. Remember that because at the end of a long day, this can be a trek. However subway and Uber are available - There is graffiti everywhere in Athens. Around the hotel yes, but we've noticed that it is literally on every street we walk to. At first this made us feel a little apprehensive, but we never felt truly unsafe.  - Melia seems very strict…\n",

The facilities are also fantastic. The room felt spacious. In my opinion the best part of the hotel is the rooftop. The views (including the Acropolis) are breathtaking. Also, having a rooftop pool AND bar with lots of comfortable seating was a great way to relax in the afternoons and evenings. In terms of location, it was a quick 30 minute walk to the Parthenon but it doesn't feel like it's in a \"touristy\" area.

Room with jaccuzi: Clean and perfect... lovely chocolate every night.  Location: We thought that we were far but only 15min walk from Monasteraki (great place) and Omonia place (good to get some food). Not convinced about the hotel location - Tear gas from police against student every saturday (both saturdays we were there)... The wind sent the tear gas to the roof top restaurant and almost all the quarter from the Polytechnic faculty in direction to Omonia plaza.  Pool: quite some and very very very busy...

It is well located within walking distance of the Plaka market, the Athens market  and a number of the must see sights. There were also an many good restaurants within walking distance. On return from our cruise we were given a free upgrade to a suite which was simply amazing and made us feel like royalty. The team were all very helpful and hospitable with every request being attended to promptly with a smile . Will most definatelly stay there again.\n",

The Melia fitted the bill perfectly.  For once the details on the web were not exaggerated.  The hotel is gorgeous, clean and modern.  We were given the most fabulous room, very spacious with a high ceiling and integral bathroom, which was light and airy.  The rooftop pool and bar were bigger than appeared on the picture on the web.  There were lay-out beds and umbrellas and a lovely bar for food and drinks.  The pool was also much bigger than I expected.  The only problem was, it was freezing cold.  Altogether, an ideal way to relax before going to the airport as we could not go around Athens with our cases. …\n",

To name the staff that helped us tremendously were Alexandes, Thanasis, Constantinow, Ilias, Vannis and George. It is so vital to having a caring and pleasant staff to help you when you are in a strange foreign country. The room was also beautiful and modern! The bed was comfy!

The hotel is a 5 min walk from the Omnia station, which is easy access to the main square and tourist areas.   BE AWARE on the train; there are plenty of pick pockets who are not afraid to get close and take advantage of you needing to move your luggage bags. Keep a watch of your belongings.   It takes a while to get here from the airport via train, so would recommend you just pay the taxi fare to save yourself an extra hour of travel and eliminate being ripped off on the train. Trains are in varying condition, but would have assumed better for a world…\n",

Also had a massage through them which was very relaxing. The location isn't the best. When we first got into a taxi the driver even cautioned us about the area. It is about a 20 minute walk to the main shopping areas, Plaka and the Parliament House so not too far out. It's only about 5 mins by uber. There isn't much in the way of restaurants or food directly around the hotel so I would suggest walking or ubering into the main area.\n",

I must praise the welcome from Alexandros - what a wonderful man. He made us feel special - wonderfully welcome. The rest of the reception staff are great. Thanks.   At the same time, the service is lousy from the cool guys in the Sky bar. Unfortunately, the rating needs to be a little bit down. Sorry Alexandros - you were amazing.   The hotel is a bit tired, but the rooms work well with all the amenities. I have a feeling you get decent value for money with breakfast included.   BUT 1: the internet is so bad that it surprise me in 2017. BUT 2: The food in Sky Bar you have to steer away, (sad quality) but the drinks are…\n",

Parking is also at a minimum but a nearby parking garage is available with a discount. Public transportation was near by. The view of the Parthenon from the roof/pool was beautiful.\n",

Felt like we just came in to the pool and were kindly hurried out to be set up for roof top dining. Decent spread in Breakfast, charges you up for sightseeing. Rooms come with Jacuzzi which is a bonus after a long hard hot day. A slight niggle was that the pillows were too big and can cause neck pain. I found two smaller pillows in the wardrobe. There were no Kettle provided for Tea/Coffee Hope they look into sorting out these two issues. Towels were changed everyday and good quality of toiletries.  Overall good experience and stay.\n",

Service at the café was slow, but the food was good. The pool area is small but lovely, and very welcome after a hot day of touring. Pool is only open from 1030am-630pm so you have to time it properly.   Rooms were a good size for Europe and very clean. Not quite North American 5* standards, but definitely a solid 4*.   I would absolutely stay at this hotel again.   Recommendation if you are touring Athens, such as the Acropolis. There is a red hop-on-hop-off tour bus stop by the Melia.

This is not a casual observation as one of our children got quite sick and yet the staff was not particularly helpful. This was also the case with trying to arrange tours. That said, I should point out the concierge (?) called Yannis, who was the only person on the staff. The location is in a seedy neighborhood, though convenient to get to both the Acropolis as well as the National Archaeological Museum. The rooms themselves were fine too.

Breakfast isn't included so we opted for cafes located near-by, which offered coffee, juice, greek yoghurt for around 2 € each.

      "Review is :I've stayed at Melia properties prior to my arrival at this particular one. I had such a horrible experience, I would never book with them ever again.   I had booked two rooms for a group of six (three to a room). Upon arrival of the first group, I had requested the rooms to be adjoining. I was told the rooms would be. When the second group arrived 15 minutes later (their transportation was delayed) they were told the second adjoining room was booked! When I asked, the front desk couldn't give me an explanation why. It was unacceptable! They avoided my group during our entire stay. Very little eye contact and refused to address us.\n",

This hotel is 2 blocks from the Metro and taxis were usually waiting at the door.  Uber was cheaper and nicer than taxis.  Don't be afraid of the graffiti!  It is not gang related and the area is safe.   The breakfast is well worth the money!   DO WATCH YOU WALLET AND BACKPACK IN THE METRO!  Avoid crowded Metro cars!

A short walk away (about 15 minutes) from Monostraki square, and the Acropolis, it's in the historic and business district, which was a nice change.  Check-in was smooth, and the service was excellent. We had a nice room with city view, and a great bathroom, including a jacuzzi bath. Great mini bar selections too, but the best part was the bed! Very comfortable.  The amenities were also amazing - steam, sauna, gym and rooftop pool (pool closes at 6:30pm so get there early!) If you want the steam/sauna started, make sure to call the night before or early in the morning so it gets nice and hot! The reception helps make things easy, and very professional.

It is within walking distance (20 minutes) of the vital Plaka section and within walking distance of several great sites in Athens. Within a rather dreary section of Athens, it stands out as a clean beacon to tourists with extremely friendly and professional staff.   The noise levels around the hotel was very low and the accommodations were excellent.  For the price we paid, we received a great and fair value.  If you are staying in athens, Hotel Melia is a worthy candidate for your consideration.\n",

Lobby was quite large with lots of seating area. We had a nice room with a great shower...spa and tub included.  The hotel was a 15 minute walk from the main tourist areas of Plaka etc. You did have to walk through some slightly shady areas but overall it was okay. We didn't eat the breakfast as €25/person/day is quite high for breakfast.

You do need to to trek away from the hotel to get to the touristy destinations,  but theres plenty of public transport, so its not hard!!

The room itself was the second surprise, it was small but not tight, soundproof and quite luxurious in look and feel. The bathroom with its hydro massage bathtub was the third surprise. The bed and linen were really comfortable. There were separate tea and coffee machines. Bathrobes felt out of the world. Wifi speed was really good.

Good sized rooms with good air conditioning, however the breakfast cost of 19 euros pp doesn't meet up to the mark. The locality of the hotel is in Omania  which has  its own issues however the food and the drink around the hotel is cheap cheap cheap for Europe. Uber only costs 3 euros to go to central Athens and within 0.9km ,your in the hub of all the tourist attractions.  The decent restaurants are in the vicinity of the Flea Markets in my opinion with some good vibes in the evening. Beware of the the trams, pickpockets and free roses and you will be all good. The city has its issues but you can't disregard the phenomenal history and culture of the city. Thanks Melia and thanks Athens:)\n",

But the bed was very comfortable and we had a big bathroom with shower and a bathtub with jacuzzi function.  Thanks for the reception who allowed us to check out at 3pm free of charge.   The area is not the best in Athens. Even if it's quiet close to the center, at night it can become very dangerous. There are lots of graffiti and strange people outside.

TV with a range of international channels, nice bathroom with own relaxing jacuzzi. Only negative point: Sometimes, you can hear slight noise from the street at night despite having the windows closed. It didn't affect much my sleep but I hope there will be an improvement in the future regarding this aspect.  The staff seems multilingual and helpful. There is a turndown service in the early evening, who close the curtains, tidy up the bed…\n",

Thank you x\n",

Expensive bcse we didn't even had breakfast included for 120€ per night! people are friendly but not very smart to make us walk at night in the center to find a restaurant better to take a taxi to be safe! U can find better for that money.\n",

Excellent customer service, very friendly staff members.. shops are very local. It was a shame the rooftop bar was close only because it not their summer season (was mentioned in the hotel info when booking).. the spa/gym/hamum was free to use. We jumped on a hop on/hop off bus (Athens Tour 20€ for 2 day trip) which took us around the attractions. Would recommend this hotel.\n",

The area is a little run down, but a lot of the city is. It's a short walk to the metro, and we walked most places anyway.   Breakfast was fine - what you would expect from a 4* hotel. All buffet and fine, but nothing special. The lobby bar was nice and we went a couple of times. Unfortunately the rooftop restaurant, bar and pool were closed - we were there in the winter!  Overall very satisfied, great value and suited our stay.\n",

The Melia is a nice hotel that is within very easy walking distance to take the subway or train to wherever you wish to go. True, as every other reviewer has said, the location is not the best at night and may be a little scary for some. But we traveled here with 2 other couples and we walked everywhere and didn't feel unsafe at all. But I wouldn't recommend that for someone traveling alone. However, whenever and wherever I travel, l don't walk the streets at night alone!  During the day, l would say the area was just as safe as walking around the city of Houston in some areas.

Initially, I was thinking this would be a great place to stay because I stay at Melía International Hotels whenever I travel abroad. This experience was definitely different and its possible because it isn't all inclusive such as the other Melía hotels I have stayed at. First and foremost, this hotel does not provide proactive anticipatory service. You pretty much have to ask for everything you need.

I was told by reception to open a window - in downtown Athens that would be like trying to sleep in the centra reservation of the highway.  2. The Wifi is included and coverage is good but speed and performance are hit and miss. Not great if you are trying to work.  3. There is no tea of coffee making facilities in the room and the lobby cafe does not open until 10.30am. Which means if you want a cup of coffee in the morning you have to pay for breakfast... which is very expensive. €100 for a 5 day stay - crazy!!!!\n",

      "Review is :I stayed here in the summer after I finished my GCSEs, we booked through British Airways holidays and chose this hotel after good reviews.  We flew Club Europe from Heathrow and arrived into Athens late morning, we arrived by metro from the airport, because the hotel is close to a metro station and the metro is very cheap as oppose to a taxi.  The hotel staff were very helpful checking us in and showed us to our room.   The roof top pool is amazing!! It has a spectacular view of the Acropolis. The pool bar is expensive but ok.  We ate at the roof top pool one evening, the food was nice and enjoyable.  If I were to visit Athens again, I would definitely book this hotel!\n",

      "Review is :The Melia Hotel is located in the center of Athens.  The rooms are beautifully furnished and comfortable, if a little on the small side.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Gym room is well equipped; particularly of note is that they have two treadmills, which reduces the chances that you'll have to wait for an hour to get your turn. A couple of minor issues we had:  1) We had a rental car, and needed to find parking space near the hotel.  At night we got lucky every time and found street parking right outside, but during the day it's very difficult to find parking, so you have to use a paid parking garage nearby. 2) Most hotels have a little coffee/tea set in the rooms so you can make yourself a cuppa whenever you feel like it; I was disappointed not to find this in the Melia.…\n",

      "Review is :We really enjoyed Hotel Melia! The staff was super friendly and the accommodations were great. We chose to upgrade when we arrived to get a higher room, a spa tub, and breakfast. I'm glad we did. The spa tub was wonderful and you can have the breakfast delivered to your room or go to the buffet. We got 2 massages while there and they were great. As Oregonians the weather was perfectly warm for us, shirts and t-shirts, but cold for everyone else. If you travel in the winter and run warm, ask for a fan because the rooms can get warm. Also it is was really disappointing that the pool was closed. All the hotel pools in the area were closed, but it would have been nice if Hotel Melia's pool or the hot tub had been available. The view looked like it would have been beautiful.  When we…\n",

With the best welcoming staff, warmest interior and deliscious food, You feel relaxed after resting in the comfortable rooms, with very panoramic view of the city. The location is crucial. Very near to the city center, by walking & sightseeing you can reach the famous Syntagma Square, where the Parlament is located, & where you can find the best shops too. Athens looked way more beautiful this time. Grateful to have to enjoy this! To the next! Greetings from Albania!\n",

      "Review is :For all the times I've stayed in Athens, this was the booking that I paid least attention to. I just wanted a hotel for two days and one night on my way back from a trip, at a reasonable price. The Melia was a very pleasant surprise - one of the best two hotel I've  stayed in, and far and away the best value. It's in a central area that you could call 'bustling', and where you might not expect a hotel of this quality. It's perfect for a business trip, or a city break. The staff are welcoming and attentive, the breakfast delicious and the room magnificent - comfortable, spacious, quiet and well-decorated. There's a rooftop pool/gym/sauna/steam complex, with views of the Acropolis. This is where I'll be going from now on. Superb.\n",

The Melia fitted the bill completely.  Just a few minutes walk from Onomonia Square and 25 mins walk from the Acropolis, or a short taxi ride away.  The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful (as most Greek people are).  The only thing I would say that let them down was the room service.  They really don't get that English people take their tea with milk and invariably the tea would arrive without milk or the milk would be hot and foamed!  Also, the tea pots had chips in the spout (only a little thing but.. !) and one had it's lid stuck back together!!!  The rooftop Sky Lounge is a lovely place to relax…\n",

At night, it was spectacular. The menu was interesting and we always had a delicious meal, and there was no need to walk the streets in the evening looking for a restaurant - many buildings nearby had some graffiti from local unrest due the economical crisis, which was a little bit of a deterrent.

The service was excellent and everyone from housekeeping up to hotel manager treated me with repsect and kindness. I really enjoyed the food from the sky lounge restaurant along with the amazing view that the hotel offers. If I need to find a negative form my stay in the hotel is nothing!!! everything was great.  Do not hesitate to pay a bit extra to enjoy a quality and with excellent service accomodation.\n",

      "Review is :Melia has a great view of the Acropolis from the roof top pool deck. Perfect spot for a lazy afternoon. The pool is a little short for swimming laps, and can be get crowded. The pool hours sre a bit odd. Can't take an early morning swim, and it closes at 5pm (or thereabouts). So if you've been out in the sun walking on hot stone and marble, and are looking forward to a cooling down swim, cut short your walking trip and double time it back to the hotel. The pool deck does reopen in the evening, but that's for bar service only. There are a few posts about Omonia being unpleasant after dark. I wasn't out and about after hours, but always fely okay during the daytime. There are some fantastic bakeries/pattiseries in the area to start the day. The hotel is s short walk to the metro,…\n",

The staff is friendly, helpful, professional, and will go out of their way to make your stay as seamless and error-free as possible. The hotel has a small exercise room (free weights, bikes, treadmills, a couple machines), a rooftop pool that turns into a nice bar overlooking the Acropolis (it even includes a telescope for day/night), and has a hot tub (although I've yet to see anyone use it). The breakfast buffet is extraordinary (omelettes to order, American style, European style, and includes a touch of greek tastes).

The staff at the hotel were very friendly and attentive. The hotel is based in an easy-walking distance to the Plaka area where restaurants and cafes abound. About a ten minute walk.

We ordered room service for two dinners and were delighted with the service and the food. Great bottle of wine for a reasonable price, too. The breakfast buffet was included in a room upgrade they offered us, and we enjoyed the variety of offerings and the great coffee.

A couple of minor issues with the personnel at the top bar (Aggelos trainee and his boss) as the waiters seem not to know how to talk properly to customers. Very fine breakfast, helpful personnel at the front desk. It's regrettable that the area (Omonia) has not improved a bit, but that's not the hotel's fault, of course.\n",

The staff are very helpful and friendly - I was very grateful when they booked a nearby hairdressing appointment for me with an excellent hairdresser! The rooms are spacious and clean. The only aspect that really needs improvement is the limited access to the roof-top pool.  It doesn't open until 10.30am and then closes at 6.30pm.  This time span really doesn't suit most tourists.

One room did not have air conditioning working at all and the room was quite hot. When I called the front desk, no technician was available. Instead of offering to switch rooms, they sent me a dirty, broken fan to get me through the night.

It has a bar/pool on the top floor with view to the acropolis but is a lot further than they lead you to belive. Also, of course the \"stunning acropolis view\" that they advertise has a lot of old roof tops and tv antenas along the way.  It could be closer to the ruins (2kms for the Agora) but the walk is very do-able.  Everything else was great\n",

Staff is extremely friendly and the room was cleaned to perfection every day! The cleaners even came twice a day to tidy up again and to leave candy on the pillow, amazing! Wonderful view of the Acropolis from the rooftop pool area, most amazing romantic dinner you can ever had on the rooftop. However, dinner was quite expensive but it was worth it, because the steik was the best I ever had! Will definitely visit Athens again and will stay in Melia for sure!!! Highly Recommend!\n",

Its not in the best part of town, but we felt safe. Great price, helpful staff. Comfortable beds,  and pillows. Bathrooms were gorgeous with rain showers, tons of space and marble. Helpful courteous staff.  The biggest problem was the AC units. Complained that it was not working, they looked at it, but didn't find much of an improvement afterwards. After the 2nd night, I had a head and chest cold. I think it was from the AC. 2 other people in our group complained of similar sinus drainage issues. It is possible it was just from traveling. But the rooms smelled musty. The AC could not even take enough moisture out of the air to dry barely damp…\n",

Location was ok, we walked to plaka area which took about 15-20min and there was the metro a 5 min walk away in omonia.  At night time area was a bit seedy, one night we walked past the park coming back from dinner and was followed and spat on by someone asking for money. The next time we walked back from omonia train station at midnight we were approached by lots of seedy people asking for money....so we decided at night we would catch taxis back from where ever we were which was actually quite cheap and easy.....

Staff were very friendly and helpful when we had questions about where to go in Athens for things. Rooms were clean and staff seemed to pop in twice a day to check on the room / reset things. Breakfast was included in our room and was very good with plenty of hot or cold choices, breads, fruits and plenty of local items to try out. The pool area was fantastic. Comfy loungers.

We were satisfied with the roofpool, the cleaning service, the reception personal and our big room. We would certanly recommend it to friends and probably return there in the future.  We were not that impressed with the carpet on the floor which was a bit old and not quite fitting to the whole style. The location although is very central and we loved it, well it is know for the high criminality and it is a bit creepy to walk at night there. We never tasted the breakfast because it costed 19 euros extra per person per day...and we chose to eat greek pastries in the nearby bakeris.\n",

The pool is beautiful and on the top of the roof is also the sky lounge for drinks and dinner. The dinner is delicious! Couldnt go past the steak and the penne.   The only few downsides is the price of drinks at this hotel. A cocktail is 11 euro. The cost of a 250ml coke is 4 euro. I think thats a bit crazy. Also the breakfast was cold and there were never eggs when we got there. So that was a let down.   Otherwise a great and comfortable stay!\n",

The hotel was clean and comfortable (although the pillows a bit hard) and the staff are really friendly and helpful. There's a few cute restaurants within walking distance around the hotel the one we really liked was Atitamos (yummy Greek homemade food) and gets great reviews on TripAdvisor.

It was very comfortable and clean. We didn't have any issues.  The room and the bathroom were very spacious. The furniture and fixtures were all well maintained and did not show wear.

The hotel is what you'd expect from a big chain (clean, modern, comfy beds, friendly staff etc) but on top of that actually had the best service I've experienced in such a hotel in my very active travelling life. Absolutely world class and what you'd normally get at a Grand Hotel. And all of it with that very friendly jovial Greek attitude to service.   The internet wasn't fast enough - they brought our own router into the room. The room service staff told us an incorrect wifi password - she came back 30 seconds later to tell us the correct one having realised her error. We arrived early - they gave us a room right away.

Food was good, including the packed breakfast we brought to the islands.

      "Review is :Melia Athens hotel was for us simply to be regarded as loss. we were informed that the hotel would not allow our 7 year old to share a bed with us. Thus Melia tried to force us to book another room at full cost. Nobody tried to accommodate our needs and requests and Melia did not show any kind of flexibility or willingness to find an appropriate solution. The way Melia handled the problem showed their non-existing commitment to customer satisfaction. Even though we had to bear much higher cost by changing hotel, than taking an additional room in Melia, we still decided to book a different hotel, which was happy to accommodate our family of 4 in a 3-bed room. The attitude of Melia made us feel NOT WELCOME, actually NOT WANTED as guests.\n",

The location is a extremely convenient and centrally located to a lot of cafes and restaurants, and more importantly, it's a short distance from the Acropolis. In fact, we took the subway (which was extremely reliable and only 3 stops away from Acropolis.) The one-way subway trip cost around 1.80 I believe, which was much cheaper than a 10-15 euro ride. We always ate breakfast and lunch in the surrounding area, which was also much cheaper than the breakfast the hotel provided. (I believe this was around 20 euros.)

Despite some reviews stating otherwise, the area was not “seedy” or “dangerous” but felt safe, or in the least, not threatening. It is obviously an urban area, so one needs to be as careful as one normally is in a city. We had, I think, the most basic room which was nice and spacious. No complaints about it whatsoever. The main feature for us was the roof, which has a lovely pool and a bar/restaurant with a view of the Acropolis. The pool was as large as one might hope considering that it was on a hotel room in the center of the city. Which for us was the main reason for choosing this particular hotel.

The roof top bar offered great views of Athens, although the bar prices were somewhat high.

The hotel is well located, close to a busy pedestrian street with lots of cafes and restaurants. Not far from the center (by center, I mean touristic center: Acropolis), about 30mn walking. The room was big but, for my taste, too much \"stuffed\" with big furniture which reduce the space. The bathroom is big. Both are very comfortable. I would say that it's a pretty modern hotel but the style looks a bit old, but it's a matter of taste. Room was clean. Very good point: the room was really quiet. Athen is a busy city with lots of noisy traffic. I like to have some silence to sleep. The guy at the reception was helpful.\n",

Buffet option seemed pricey and was more cost efficient to have coffee and eggs in our room.  The pool is nice. You have to get up there early to get a sun lounger but it's nice. The water temp is freezing even in 33degrees of heat.  I would recommend this hotel if you are not planning to spend time in your room (as there is no view) and require the pool for a dip to refresh.  It's been a great base for us to explore Athens.\n",

I already mentioned under the booking that we are travelling with 2 year old baby but they insisted that we needed to upgrade the room in order to be able to have our baby with us... it was not an upgrade actually, they changed us additional 20 Euros per night to give us the baby bed in the same room!

But- the area is awful , unless u take a taxi or have a car u need to walk it and it is most unpleasant at night. The rooftop hours are just plain stupid, bar staff is obnoxious and prices are outrageous. We had a wonderful time but honestly i expected more from melia\n",

The roof top bar at night looking over the lit up Acropolis is a treasure. It matches and exceeds The Rex in Saigon. Late dinner on the roof top was worth experiencing.  Athens is tired and dirty. The Melia is a good value base and refuge whilst there\n",

We were disappointed that the pool closed at 6.30pm as this was usually the time we got back from sightseeing and still very warm where a swim would have been great - nonetheless the pool and bar area was small but a good plus for the hotel.   The front desk service was fine, nothing amazing, just a usual check in process. The room was very clean.   I did not like the area at night in particular. We walked a few blocks to the busy restaurant area but I did not feel comfortable to walk back at night - the streets are dark and a little eerie at night but the cab ride from the busy area was only 3euros so…\n",

Roof top pool and bar is a very nice addition and well worth spending some time up there. Would certainly return next time I'm back in Athens.\n",

Bfast had a great variety each morning and service was relatively quick as everyone was heading out.   We had lunch one day at Cafe Mondo and it was delicious and reasonably priced.  It's one of the few hotels in Athens with a pool - not to mention a rooftop pool.   Yes, the deck area is small and there are limited lounge chairs but it was wonderful to have a pool to come back to each day for a swim and a beer.  The view is beautiful.

We needed at add a room at the last minute and they somehow got us an adjacent room to our suite which was greatly appreciated - they went to a lot of trouble to make this happen.   Breakfast is very good and the roof top bar and swimming pool is a welcome relief on those hot summer days.   My only gripe is the poor state of the area that the hotel is situated in - Omonoia -which was once the main centre of Athens and is now almost derelict. Although we never felt in fear, it's just an awful backdrop to stay in.   The hotel itself is very good.\n",

The best thing about the hotel is the roof top pool and view of the acropolis.  The roof top restaurant was disappointing with the meal being luke warm. Ordering a drink behind the bar was difficult due to the limited English spoke by the barman and I don't speak Greek! The hotel pool had limited hours not opening until 10.30am and closing at 6.30 which seemed early as a lot of people wanted a dip after sight seeing. The hotel reception staff were friendly.\n",

The Reception directed us to a local bakery, there are many just a short distance from the hotel, so we could grab some breakfast. Returning at 11.30 the rooms were still not ready (but they were cleaning them now), so reception suggested we sit up at the rooftop pool. It was extremely hot so we did not last very long there. Eventually we were checked in at 14.10, with our 2nd room available at nearly 3pm. We were compensated with a free drink at the pool.  The rooms themselves were great, quality beds, bedding and furniture, no outlook from them but more than comfortable for a city break.

Staff in general our good and helpful. Specially the reception manager Julie. They gave us a late check out free of charge which was very nice and helped us with our money exchange issues. Staff need to have more training regarding respect towards guest like saying hello and goodbye in the reception. And when they enter the life with a guest they need to ask the guest which floor before pressing theirs.  Was fairly close to all interesting attractions but anyways taxis in Athen are the cheapest I have seen in Europe.\n",

It's about a 20 minute walk to monastraki square for Acropolis etc. Omonia station is less than 5 minutes away and really easy to navigate. The hotels pool on the roof is small but lovely with amazing views of the Acropolis at night. It's a shame that the pool closes at 6.30 as they turn the area into a restaurant.

There is also a nice gym on the roof and the rooftop pool and bar is lovely during the day. However, I have decided not to stay at the Melia again for 2 reasons. Firstly the internet access is very poor. There is supposed to be internet access in the rooms, but it is intermittent, so I could only receive e-mails on mass every time the internet kicked in, and then write e-mails and wait for them to send, sometimes hours later when there was internet. This made working very difficult (the main purpose of the visit) and also cost me a lot in phone calls as I couldn't use internet based forms of communication such as Skype or Whatsapp. The second major frustration is the way…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed our last night in Greece in this hotel before heading to an early flight at the airport.  The hotel is a short walking distance (15-20 minutes) from the Monastiraki and Plaka tourist areas, in a district that looks a little bit dodgy to the typical American or European.  But so looks seem to be the rest of Athens outside of the tourist centre: lots of graffiti, occasional abandoned houses. At least for our price the quality was good, more or less what you expect for a four star hotel, but I presume the prices may vary a lot.  However, at the time of our visit the Internet connection suffered from severe congestion.  The WiFi wireless signal itself was ok in our room, but we couldn't get the IP addresses for some of our devices and when we got an IP address, the packet…\n",

But it was relatively comfortable, I used the extra blankets in the wardrobe to put this in. The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels provided.   POOL:The rooftop pool was good, clean and you get a great view. There were usually enough sunbeds/chairs for us when we arrived. The staff at the rooftop bar were good, very friendly and efficient.   SURROUNDINGS:The area around the hotel is run down, but it didn't bother me and I felt safe in the area. There were good transport links to other places in Athens, with the metro only a 5 min walk away. There were also lots of places to eat nearby for dinner.  …\n",

However, the hotel is located on a residential, business district that is a bit far from the main attractions and far from the Plaka district where small shops and the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum are located.  If on a family or group vacation I highly recomend staying in the Plaka area.  The Melia has a great Sky lounge with great views of the Acropolis and good drinks and food.\n",

The staff was very warm and welcoming. My only two gripes that prevent me from making it a 5 stars is that as a general, in Europe, I haven't found a single hotel with a decent/strong air conditioner.

The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful - we asked for an early check but hotel was busy and not available.  However, many guests arriving early don't seem to realise the check in time in 2.00 pm.  Yes, we would all like an early check after an early arrving flight, but it is not always possible.  The reception staff have their work cut out explaining this to grumpy guests who seem to think they are entitled to a room at 8.30 am on the day their check in is 2.00 pm.  …\n",

The hotel \"sells\" mostly the 9th view of the Acropolis, which is indeed very nice, but that floor closes at 6:30 pm (as a bar and pool) and only reopens at 8:00, as a restaurant = most probably, you will miss the sun set. The area of the city where the hotel is located is also not nice at all. In general, not worth the price.\n",

The restaurant upstairs unfortunately let us down, the food wasn't great and the service was very slow. But everything else was great.

It's a few minutes walk to Omonia tube station which connects to 2 (our is it 3??) metro lines; anyway, it's easy to get anywhere in town from there.  The hotel is modern, the roof top pool is nice although not very spacious, but it's great to go there after a day sightseeing. Drinks / food at the roof garden are overpriced though.  There is a little gym at the roof top which is descent, although nothing out of this world. There's a sauna and steam room near the gym but did not try them.  Rooms are nice, air conditioned, bathroom was nice too (all marble). There's a well stocked minibar. There's a safe in the room.  Breakfast is ok.

On our way back, we did receive an upgrade in our rooms and it did have a jacuzzi, which was indeed cool. Also, another great thing about this hotel was the TV Radio which had speakers in the bathroom as well. So you can hear and dance on to your favourite song while taking a bath.

Let's start with the location- we should have researched this in advance as it turns out that Omonia and surrounding streets are pretty grotty- bordering on feral. On the first day there was a tramp passed out just beyond the revolving door which apparently no one really cared about. Walking home at night we didn't feel particularly safe as there are a lot of dodgy people/wild dogs wandering around. We had a room on the 1st floor and it was old fashioned, a little grubby, and noisy throughout the stay. As the hotel is on a busy street it was unsurprising to hear pretty loud…\n",

The hotel is in the omonia district of Athens, which is about a a mile from the main syntagma square area.  Hotel appearance from outside leaves a little to be desired, mainly due to the amount of graffiti on surrounding buildings, but then again virtually the whole of Athens is graffiti covered. Hotel interior is a different story, very tastefully decorated with lots of light coloured wood and contrasting paint schemes. The corridors were a little dark though. Hotel room was lovely, again light timber and contrasting coloured walls, with lots of full height mirrors and full height Windows.

There's a few good eateries nearby (which the concierge recommended). We walked around most of the time (about 2km to Acropolis).  Our check-in experience was somewhat different the 1st and the 2nd time. The lady that check us in the first time was much nicer than the man that checked us in the 2nd time.

It had a nice bar and coffee/snack area  and restaurant facilities.  The breakfast was not the best but still pretty.  The staff were extraordinarily helpful.

It is a business hotel, to Meliá’s standards. We knew it was not right in Plaka and were prepared to take taxis and/or the subway to move around, but it was not necessary as all main sights are within walking distance (30 to 45 minutes away – but then, of course, we are big on walking, and it was *not* sizzling hot). Staff were friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out somewhat slow, not excessively. Also, as our outbound flight did not leave until mid-afternoon and they let us enjoy a complimentary late check-out, I will not complain.

However, on our first night we just went for a walk, and trusted our sense of direction to find somewhere to eat.... we did eventually, but found the city a little un-nerving at night. Athens is struggling with Greece's financial situation and the number of trapped immigrants. No actual crime scene, but grafitti everywhere, and many places go earily quiet at night.. we were a little worried, especially when we stumbled on a camp in a park. The next day we took a city site seeing bus, we used the red ones.. Brilliant, and frequent service. This helped us to get our bearings and Athens came alive for us, and we had a great time.

Keep that in mind. We had to upgrade and pay to be on the level floor which included coupons and free breakfast but there was I believe 35 dollar per night charge for this!! Keep that in mind!  Traveling from Canada we were looking forward to the roof top patio which was closed! Gym was great and so was sauna and steam shower!   Lobby bar was great although we just had wine and beer there!  We tried the room service which was good! Solid serving sizes!  We also tried the restaurant no issues there!  Hotel is in walking distance of majority of sights we put in about 20,000-30,000 steps a day here! And…\n",

      "Review is :We spent five days in Melia Athens recently and found the hotel ok. But a few matters resulted in a lower rating than otherwise would have been the case. First, the top floor bar was closed for the winter, even if this was one of the advertised features, with views to the Acropolis. Then we got a message in the room one day which asked us to contact the reception immediately. But when checking with reception, we were told there was a mistake and there was nothing. And the wireless in the part of the hotel where we stayed was so weak it was practically useless. Small things, in an otherwise fine stay in Athens, but sometimes the small things is was makes a great stay.\n",

The rooms were clean, tidy and well kept. The rooftop bar has a good view of the Acropolis with a lively vibe for an evening drink or meal. The breakfast buffet had little variety and was the same each day, but was tasty (go early to get a table, as the dining area is small and quickly fills). Important to note that the location is on the edge of Omonia which has a bad reputation of being the 'dangerous area' of Athens.

Additionally, the water pressure was so low in the sink that we had to resort to using the bathtub to wash our hands and brush our teeth.

The Front Desk Agent told us that breakfast didn't begin until 6:30am so there was no coffee, we'd have to go out and buy some. It was 6:23am. Thanks bro, I can see how those 7mins would really put you out. WiFi in the lobby is free, in room it's paid.\n",

As with most hotels, expect the drinks to be relatively more expensive.   On the same floor, there is spa area and gym which is well maintained.   Location wise, it's about 15 minutes walk to the main areas of Athens. The immediate neighbourhood looks a bit run down but overall, a great hotel!\n",

It is an easy 12 minute stroll to the Acropolis. If you want a great book to read before you come to Greece read - The Bull of Minos by P Cottrell. Fascinating history of the excavation of Mycenae and Knossis. I can honestly say it brought the history alive.   As far as the hotel - the room had a very comfy bed. Yes, I accept the carpet is a bit worn and perhaps the curtains are a bit dated however it was very clean. we had a room at the back of the hotel so it was absolutely quiet.

We didn't have any trouble during our stay here, even when at night but we were told by numerous people not to go further into Omonia.

We were upgraded to a room with jacuzzi, really comfy bed and soundproof sleep. We spent all our spare time on the top floor by the pool, taking in the views and planning our trips.  Great place to chill, swim and order snacks.  Love the Greek Mohito :-) The gym and Hamman/sauna is on the top floor too, looks good but didn't try it.

Omonia square didn't look inviting at 11pm and honestly a bit scary for the tourists. On the other hand, the hotel itself was very nice and clean.  The room was pretty spacious with separate hall and bathroom (which had a TV speaker built in). The bed was a little too soft for our standard. Plenty of toiletries in the bathroom were replaced daily, there were also bath robes and slippers. The towels looked worn out and would need a replacement. The room didn't have a balcony but there was a nice roof terrace to enjoy the view.   Wifi connection was good only in the lobby. The pool on the roof was great, especially…\n",

Rooftop bar and (smallish) swimming pool are excellent (great Acropolis view at night). Beers expensive - but that's the trade off for the location.  Breakfast, if not included in your price, is €18/head (€9 for a child) - I'd skip that, as there are numerous alternatives (much cheaper) close by.  Just be aware that Athens seems to be covered in graffiti at the moment (post-protest residue), making it seem far less welcoming than it really is.\n",

We have stayed in many Melia hotels in Spain, Italy and the standard was always generally high and satisfying. For this reason we picked the Melia in Athens. Well, the hotel is NOT in line with Melia standard and I am surprised the Melia management is not doing anything about this. Just to mention one thing: we had to wait 15 mins to get in the small breakfast room because it was full. There were like 20 people waiting to have breakfast. I travel a lot for both work and pleasure and it is the first time something like this occurs to me. The room was also decadent and would need a lot of renovation and better cleaning. There was only one window on the internal small patio - it was extremely dark even…\n",

The rooftop pool and Sky Lounge was brilliant and had a great view of the Acropolis. It was amazing to sit and have an evening meal seeing everything lit up, really breathtaking. The breakfast was also really nice with lots of choice; perfect to fill up on before a day of sightseeing.

You get fired from the swimming pool area (really too early in summer it's still sunny at that hour... and when you get back from a day of visit at 5 o'clock it is very frustrating). Even worse as the bar is located at the pool, you have nothing to do if you want to have a drink (the lobby bar  not being used...).

Bath looked a little grubby, and instead of a double room had a twin with the beds pushed together. Room has no kettle and you need to pay €2 to borrow one. Interesting pricing scheme for drinks, mini bar is the cheapest option, followed by room service and then the priciest option of the roof bar. Pool is small but not too overcrowded, nice for an afternoon cool down. Restaurant was nice and food was good, if a little pricey after a week on Hydra. Staff are friendly and helpful.

The original ad said they had free wi-fi if you joined their frequent stayer club but it turns out you have to stay at least once.  However they had wi-fi in the lobby and in the breakfast room and around the pool and that was more than enough.

The walk to the metro was quick and actually, it was walking distance to the Plaka area. My friend and I were just walking around Plaka and out of no where ended back at our hotel... haha. There were a few little shops around that we ate dinner in.. nothing fancy but we felt it was pretty authentic.   The only reason I would give it 4 stars and not 5 is because wifi was not free inside the hotel rooms. It was only free in the lobby and the pool area.

It is a short walk to Omonia Metro Station and about 1.5km from Syntagma Square. Happy with the location but if too hot or you do not like walking or catching the Metro best to consider more central hotels. The sky lounge/pool area has a great view of the Acropolis and was impressed when a staff member removed towels from lounge chairs that where being held for over an hour by people that had obviously gone off for a day trip.

Great rooms, quiet and great wifi, satellite tv, superior bathrooms.  The staff is always pleasant, which is not always the case in Athens.  The only negative is the location, Omonia Square.

It was our first time overseas.  Every detail of the rooms, from the soft beds to the no-fog bathroom mirrors to the cleanliness and housekeeping and mini-bar, was awesome. It definitely made the start of our honeymoon wonderful. The front desk was so helpful with whatever we needed and the location is within easy walking distance of ALL the sites of Athens, or a very quick cab ride if you don't want to walk.  The Sky Lounge, which is the rooftop bar, is BEAUTIFUL with a view of the city and The Parthenon, and a pool and great ambiance!  The spread for breakfast was huge with lots of yummy food.

It totally delivered! The staff were polite, knowledgeable and efficient. The bedroom and bathroom was spotless and the entire building was attractive and inviting. The breakfast was marvellous, having a huge choice of both cold and hot food. It also catered for early and late birds (open 6.30-10.30am). By far the best feature was the roof top pool. It isn't huge but it was perfect for my needs. I wanted to relax and enjoy the sunshine and I did here because there was also a fully-stocked bar and attentive staff supplying me with Prosecco at 7 euros a glass.

The hotel staff made all the telephone calls to the Operator to solve the situation. Finally we went to the City Tour.  Fifteen minutes walk to Plaka and Sygtama. Very quiet. Nice breakfast.

The room itself was clean and spacious and the hotels facilities are lovely too. They have a pool and jacuzzi on the roof terrace where you can see the Acropolis in the distance. The jacuzzi was freezing cold as the temperature could not be adjusted so we just used the pool. We also enjoyed dinner on the roof terrace once and it was very food too. The drink prices are a bit on the higher side during the day and evening so we did not have that many.

A great roof top pool with bar and views onto the Acropolis is also a nice feature.  It turns into a restaurant in the evening, which we didn't try.  Our room was well thought through and comfortable, though pretty stereotypical of this kind of large, anonymous hotel which could be anywhere in the world.  The bathroom included jacuzzi and jet shower.  The staff weren't in the least impersonal though  - particularly the lady at reception and the life guard.  Really helpful and welcoming.  The receptionist recommended a wonderful little restaurant round the corner where we ate almost every day; i Kriti.  Great local food,…\n",

Price-performance ratio was good. They have a bar, which is ok for a couple of drinks and a club sandwish if you don't want to go out.

Good selection of both hot and cold food and drinks at breakfast. The rooftop area with the pool and jacuzzi is the star attraction of the Melia with a distant view of the Acropolis.

The hotel gave us free wi-fi which was very helpful as when we reached Athens we did not have a local Sim card. The rooms were spacious and the staff was very courteous.   However, since I am a Vegetarian (Indian), we found very few options at the breakfast table. Also, since we had not booked our tours from the hotel we were not informed by the front desk when they had come to pick us up. All in all a nice place to stay in Athens.\n",

We had a whale of a time in Athens and Meliá played a really key part of it. I was a little worried at our arrival becouse I didn't know if I could find a parking place nearby but the management gave me a really good advice where to find it so I coud park the car next to the hotel and without any extra cost.

If you are staying in Athens as a tourist, you will find yourself 45 mins walk away from all of the sights, which are very centralized in Athens. Cabs are cheap but one thing that a tour guide said to us that made me do a double take was to \"never walk at night in that area near your hotel\". You can tell you shouldn't as it looks very run down to the naked eye with graffiti everywhere. Inside the hotel is very nice, but one pet peeve of mine is that you have to pay for internet BUT if you sign up to be a Melia Rewards member (for free) you get free internet during your stay. If you don't, they charge you by the hour unless you go down and use the free wifi in the lobby\n",

Unfortunately the rooftop was under construction, so we didn't had the chance to take a look. Additionally there was plenty of noise early in the morning during the weekend due to the construction. We also found out that the Hotel wasn't so central, it's a long walk to the Acropolis and other sights... Therefore I would recommend to try another hotel until the rooftop is done and then be aware that you won't be directly in the middle of the sights. Apart from that the hotel has a good standard and is quite comfortable. A bakery and a bank are just are around the corner.\n",

The room was a good size for the two of us, and most importantly clean!

Super clean , new and nicely decorated rooms!!!! saw several rooms , as the room they initially checked us in has an issue with the heating and we had to change room. Because this problem occured at 02:00am , the night shift hadnled the situation, and they upgraded us room. Very nice bed, pillows, freebies, slippers, room. Everyhting perfect. The only minus is that the area is not that safe and at night might be doggy.  Service was very good (reception , room servise, housekeeping). Totally suggesting it!\n",

We enjoyed a lovely meal in the restaurant one night - the menu was limited but the food was good. Prices what you would expect in a city based hotel. Not too far to walk to the city centre and enough bars/restaurants in easy distance for the evening. Would recommend this hotel. One criticism - I chose this hotel for its roof terrace and views of the acropolis but the terrace was closed and couldn't even be opened for me to go and take photos. Despite it being \" winter\" to the Greeks, it was t-shirt warm for us so we would have liked to sit out there in the evening.\n",

We had a suite which was very nice but not large for a suite, the city views are just buildings across the road (Room 807) so not magnificent but it was comfortable and well decorated.  A couple of slight improvement opportunities, an Iron would be nice, they will supply one but take it away daily, I asked for it to be left in the room but this wasn't possible. I would expect an iron in a suite, and have not stayed in a suite elsewhere where I had to ask daily.  We were also woken every morning at 0815 by builders banging on the roof but obviously this isn't going to be the case for everyone.

We chose the Melia hotel because it  appeared to be quite central and looked good value for money, it was also the first hotel suggested by the travel company.   On reading the reviews before we left I was concerned about the location, with a few people commenting on the neighbourhood being quite 'rough'. We didn't experience this during our stay. We always felt completely safe walking back to the hotel very late.

Another room was allocated but to prevent heat exhaustion the window had to be left open (with traffic noise). Apart from that the room was clean well appointed but no tea/coffee facilities. Bathroom very good. Main issue though was the lack of anything else in the building. Cafe shut by 1900 , roof top closed completely and bar unattended.

The receptionist almost look smug while informing us of our dilemma. They then transferred us to a large \"holiday inn\" style hotel out of town. Which we felt was a down grade from the Melia.  To top it off it then turn out that lady gaga was playing in Athens during our stay. So we probably lost our room as they could charge higher rates for the concert.

Although the surrounding Omonia Square area was a little unsavoury, we found the hotel itself to be very pleasant and well located for easy access to the sites.  Our room was quite, clean and well facilitated - the Jacuzzi bath was a god send after a day of hoofing around the city!  We didn't opt for breakfast and didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment, but the rooftop bar and pool were an added bonus for the days when we were feeling less energetic.  Having visited some of the other hotels in Athens, I'd definitely recommend the Melia for its value, central location and overall quality.\n",

Either in the ground floor coffee bar or on the roof terrace. The terrace is the biggest asset of the hotel. It has a small swimming pool, jacuzzi, lounge chairs, bar and of course beautifil view of the Acropolis. The hotel serves a good breakfast so it is worth while paying the extra fee.\n",

Not the nicest area of the city, but hard to distinguish that because of the ubiquitous graffiti which seems to have reached epidemic proportions across the whole of Athens and Piraeus!

They explained everything about the hotel to us very clearly and well. When we entered the room, we found it a bit small. And there was not much of a view. However, our bathroom was nice and spacious with a bath tub and a shower. The coolest thing about the room was the fact that the Radio through the TV played even on the speakers inside the bathroom :)  Our friends who were staying at a hotel next door found our room very big because theirs was apparently half the size. So I am guessing…\n",

It is about a 30 min walk to the Acropolis. Lots of shops and restaurants along the way. Not right in the heart of Athens but its not too far away from anything. Staff are helpful. Breakfast was nice too but very expensive.\n",

The hotel is extremely clean and modern and the staff were all very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. We had 2 'Supreme' rooms on the 5th floor which differed quite a lot to be honest. Our room had a different layout to our daughter's and had a much larger bathroom, while hers seemed to have a bit more furniture and a lot more mirrors... Regardless of that, both rooms were very clean, had good air conditioning, decent TV, a free safe, and you could get Wi-Fi by signing up to the Melia group (for free). All the public areas have free Wi-Fi anyway, but you need to sign up to get it in your room for some reason. Beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well supplied with everything we…\n",

Its quite dirty, graffiti absolutely everywhere. Generally quite rundown. I was told by several people who lived locally, not to walk around after 7pm as it wasn't safe.

Breakfast wasn't the most appetising so I would've rather spent my €9 at the many bakeries surrounding the hotel instead in retrospect. Service at the hotel was generally good. Maria at the front desk was particularly helpful. The night staff at reception were frosty on occasion. Views from the rooftop outstanding.

I don't need a mini bar stocked or nibbles / chocolates - may I suggest that in future you don't stock rooms with beverages and nibbles!  It's a great location, possibly on the edge of a tacky area but I never felt threatened walking day or night on my own. The Melia staff are very friendly and helpful, great breakfast which was included with my accommodation.  It was very hot and I used the roof top pool bar each afternoon but an issue for me was the pool was only opened from 10.30am to 6.30pm. Then 8pm to 1am for dinner / drinks but no swimming.

We really wanted a hotel with a rooftop pool and close enough to a metro, so on these items the hotel met our requirements, but unfortunately it fell down on everything else, particularly the staff. The hotel is a 5 min walk (10 mins with luggage) to the Omonia metro station. Whatever other reviewers say about the location being dodgy, I would ignore them. This is central Athens, yes there’s graffiti and people begging, but that’s the norm for many cities! At no point did we feel unsafe, even walking home late at night. Our check in was pretty unfriendly, no “welcome to Melia” or “how was your journey”. We had paid in advance and were told that it included breakfast at check-in, but when we went for breakfast…\n",

Our room was very spacious and bathroom included a spa bath.  Our towels were checked twice daily and replaced if required.  We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there are plenty of places to eat nearby.

The rooms are about 144square feet not including the bathroom. The carpet that started out as a golden yellow is now a light shade brown- a simple course of rug shampoo can fix this.

We especially loved the spacious beds and the marble bathroom with wonderful shower and bathing facilities. The rooftop pool is really nice and the views are good. The drink menu at the rooftop bar is a little bit overpriced, but that's nothing you should turn down this hotel for. The location is good, close to Omonia square (metro) and a straight walk into Monastiraki and Plaka. Even if the reputation of the area isn't too good, I didn't experience or notice anything unpleasant while there. The hotel is located close to wonderful cafés and bakeries, where you can have breakfast, lunch or snacks for a low price.\n",

The location, although very central and good walking distance from Monastiraki, was not particularly nice. It did not feel safe, especially at night.

      "Review is :Me and my Partner stayed here for 10 days, seeing sights, having some good food and visiting Islands.  After a few issues with a member of the Melia Reservations Team not booking a taxi, and denying all knowledge of receiving my email with my mobile number to confirm the transfer to the hotel, everything was in place for our stay.   The Taxis charge a fixed price of €45 when booked through the hotel from the Airport to the Hotel (we booked our own coming back and it was €35), the Taxi Driver informed us to not travel out of the hotel by foot after 8PM at night as the local area was a bit dodgy.  He was right - upon entering the room, we realised our room was on the front of the building, looking directly into offices/night classes, because the buildings were quite close together…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the Melia Athens twice in June in between island travels and it was an okay place.  Our rooms were upgraded but they were still nothing special.  Most importantly, the customer service was very average.  They were not rude or anything but we didn't feel like they really cared about their customers.    It was a good value for the location though.  It is very close to the metro and there plenty of places close by to eat.  It looks kind of ghetto because there is graffiti all around but I think it's like that everywhere in Athens for the most part.    The view of the Acropolis from the restaurant on top was nice but there was a lot of ugly buildings in front of it so it's not as good as you think from their website.  We never used the pool because it closes fairly…\n",

The first time the hotel lost our booking and it took 1.5 hours to sort out with the 'guy behind the scenes'. Both the agency that we booked through and the lady at the front counter had troubles with this person. He told the agency initially that he had our faxed reservation and then he didn't and they'd need to fax it again. They had to fax it twice. The lady at the Melia desk couldn't understand him, apparently he sounded sick. It was frustratingly draining. At 10:30pm we were finally checked into our room. She was nice enough to upgrade us.  The second time we couldn't get coffee from the restaurant for our room. We had breakfast with our accomms and usually love to sit in bed…\n",

The best feature of the hotel is the roof top Sky Lounge. By day there are sun loungers round the lovely pool and at night you can eat with a great view of the city, Parthenon and sunset. The menu is reasonably priced and portions are large, food nicely presented. Best to book a table. It is a nuisance that it closes 6.30 to 8pm if you want a drink. The wine is reasonable but the cocktails are over priced. There is a decent gym with modern equipment and a great view. It is a short walk to the nearest metro station Omonia, and you can reach the Acropolis is under 15 minutes from the hotel. I would certainly stay here…\n",

A lot of effort was given to make sure the three rooms were interconnected. Wifi works fine and is for free in the public areas.   Last but not least: try the Sky lounge with var and swimming pool!

The hotel is very close (5 mins walk) to the metro station (OMONIA). This was very useful for people who don't want to hire taxi for commuting. The rooftop poolside restaurant and bar (sky lounge) was really good with a pretty view of the lit-up Acropolis at night. Food menu was limited and food was okay-ish.

      "Review is :We recently stayed in the Melia Hotel in Athens. Their website shows views of the Acropolis from the rooftop bar. It also shows a rooftop swimming pool and it also shows a lovely looking bar downstairs. If you are planning to go to this hotel, you may wish to note that none of these facilities are open until May; some of this information is hidden in one of the pages but of course not on the front page! We found it very unusual to pay for a 4 Star hotel without an operating bar although we were informed that we could have asked for drinks from the cafe and taken it into the bar area which during our stay was in darkness! All in all, not an experience that I would have expected from a reputable hotel chain such as the Melia. In case the Customer Experience Manager chooses not to…\n",

During our stay, not all the facilities were open - probably because of it being out of season and so few guests in the hotel. It would have been too chilly to be on the rooftop terrace! I can imagine that in the summer though, it's fantastic up there.   The only restaurant open in the hotel was the Cafe - not great and I would strongly suggest jumping in taxi (already waiting right outside the hotel doors) and heading off to the Plaka area, where there are some wonderful eating places.

As a Platinum Melia member, I chose this hotel, due to interesting reviews on this site, and because to its central location. And must say I was disappointed. Nothing looked like on the photos submitted by the management to Tripadvisor. Moreover, some of the sites were closed down or not really up to Melia standards.  I was upgraded to Supreme room, but once I saw the room, I asked myself how the standard rooms looked like.  The room itself was just OK. Nothing special. Comfy bed and this was it.

      "Review is :I have read al the reviews and I can certainly agree with some negative comments regarding cost of breakfast and drinks on the rooftop terrace but the one I am scratching my head at is the comments about the location? It takes around 5 mins to walk to the pedestrian area if you follow Oktober street (that's our nickname for it), this is where the shopping and bars are that lead you to Plaka.  I am a conservative woman in my 40s and its fair to say possibly over cautious at times and I wandered from the hotel by myself on several occasions. Sure, there are a few beggars and maybe the odd drunk but come on, you can see this in any city in the world. This hotel is very nice. Our room was a superior admittedly but one of the largest I've ever stayed in with all mod cons and the…\n",

The rooms were comfortable nicely decorated. Tight in space but enough room for two people. I would skip the continental breakfast there are eateries and bakeries in walking distance that give a better value. The people at the front desk are very helpful with tips and suggestions for things to do outside the normal tourist activities. Unfortunately the upstairs roof bar is closed the same months as the pool which was disappointing not getting to see that view. Altogether though a good place to stay.\n",

However, I must say that I was thoroughly disgusted with the accommodations and service received---and quite surprised. First of all, I booked and paid for a room with two separate beds.  I was told that there weren't any.  If I had known that I wouldn't have booked.  I brought my 70-year-old neighbor with me and this was her first trip abroad so I wanted it to be special.

The walls are scuffed and dirty as are the carpets. these need to be regularly shampooed or replaced .The beds are comfortable but my over riding impression came from street noise.

The main areas of tourist interest like Syntagma square and Monastiraki are nearby and take few minutes by metro. The hotel staff were friendly and professional.

We dropped off our luggage and went to chill at the rooftop pool bar to relax off the jet lag which was great for that. We then walked to the acroplois which was around half an hour away - not bad. Location of the hotel isn't the best but most of athens looks this way so I didnt expect any less. Perfect for one night just to see acropolis and hang around the city. We left the next day to the islands but wanted to see athens for the night. Good view of the acropolis at night. Good but overpriced drinks at the bar. Overall - good experience.\n",

Rooms are a little tired and the lay-out of the bathrooms is interesting to say the least (esp room 106). But for the price couldn't really fault it. Will certainly be going back as I visit Athens often and it's fairly central (do turn right out of the hotel, turning left can take you to some rather dodgy areas).\n",

There are plenty of tables to sit and eat and enjoy the view of the acropolis and likavitos.  The rooms are very very nice too!  The bathroom had a shower that sprayed your entire body, which was a nice touch.  The location is nice insofar as it is a skip away from the metro, otherwise, I would not want to stay here if you are looking to walk around at night.  If you are just touring the city during daytime hours and want a nice place to kick back after a long summer day, stay here.  The pool closes at 6pm for swimming, but reopens at 8pm for lounging.\n",

We stayed in an executive room, which was larger and provided our daughter a sofa bed to sleep in while my husband and I slept in a separate room.  The room was very large by European standards, very clean, and modern.  The roof top pool was wonderful and we liked the view of the Acropolis.  We also enjoyed the saunas.  The location was perfect for us, with a short walk to Omonia station of the metro.  Everyone working at the front desk was friendly and helpful and seemed to speak many different languages fluently.

The room was lovely and some of the staff were extremely helpful, thank you to Efi andThanasis on reception and  to Demetrius the lifeguard at the pool. The pool, sauna, steam room and gym are excellent. The breakfast was ok, it would have been nice to have had some English breakfast teabags though, and some mornings the scrambled egg was extremely runny. Overall this hotel was acceptable, I do think it would be helpful if the staff warned the guests of the pickpockets operating on the underground, we had a wallet taken and we know of at least one other guest who had her purse taken at the same station (Monastiraki).\n",

There is a roof-top swimming pool and a massage centre for which you need to book in advance. Break-fast buffet is adorable though not outstanding in choices. If you are used to light Lunches, many Coffee shops around the Hotel serve aromatic Coffee and Cakes.

That said, we were always back at the hotel by midnight and agreed we would not want to walk around the hotel after then unless necessary, only taxi to the front door.

      "Review is :I stayed on 15th May for 3 nights and its a nice hotel and in general good clean and very good value for money for the center of Athens. I would say breakfast is not cheap at 18 Euro, we decided to eat out, plenty of places close by. Yes the hotel is not in the best of locations, but in walking around I thought it was safe.  The rooms were of a good size and the bed was very comfortable,the hotel was also quiet will allowed for a good night sleep. The only thing I would say is that for a 5 star hotel ( i belive more like a 4 star)  there should be an iron in the room, I also found the towles were very hard, they looked and felt like they should be replaced with new ones.  Overal for the price I think its a good hotel to stay in.\n",

All bar staff were good, however our visit was ruined by the surly, unwelcoming male member of staff on reception. I arrived in late from my flight and he made me feel so unwelcome he had a very bad attitude and was like a school teacher in his demeanour. On the second day the wi-if was not working and we needed to find out information on ferries to the islands we enquiried from him and he barely acknowledged us - such a rude manner I would never stay here again based solely on his attitude.\n",

It was much better than we had expected and was incredible value for money. The room was a good size with a very large comfortable bed and marble shower and toilet. The staff at reception were extremely helpful with any directions and arranged for the steam room and sauna to be prepared on request. The wi-fi only works in the lobby and the roof top bar, not in the bedrooms. It was lovely sitting by the swimming pool on the roof top looking at the view of the Acropolis. We did not book breakfast, but found a very nice bakery with restaurant a short walk away. It was not far to the nearest metro and we bought the 24 hour transport tickets to get around.\n",

Perfect for coming and going to the airport by train which is a third cheaper than a cab. Room: a big room with a nice bed and spacious bathroom. The tv was null but we didn't care but the wifi was terrible and almost non existing inside the room. We had to go to the elevator room or the lobby to get some wifi, a major issue for us.

It was half the price of the other hotels I mentioned. But I don't feel at all like I am staying somewhere just because it is cheap. In fact, the room is nicer than the intercontinental - ever the recently rennovated ones. The rooms at the Melia are smaller, but they are normal hotel room size, which is fine. Stylishly decorated and modern, which you can say about the decor throughout the hotel. The hotel is generally a bit small - no huge lobby, etc. but how much does that really matter?

Secondly, the carpet in our room, which was No. 416, had a filthy looking carpet.   I complained to Reception who made a note of my comment.   Unfortunately, when returning to the room, someone had tried to get the stains out of the carpet, unsuccessfully, leaving lighter shades around the stains.   Not a good look.   However, the staff were very courteous and helpful and the view from the pool area was magnificent, especially at night.\n",

Unfortunately the area very down town,post riot damaged buildings boarded up, graffiti and litter everywhere.Athens was once a beautiful city,with its people proud and courteous. On many occasions elderly people stood on public transport,whilst children sat. The hotel was clean,with a lovely roof top pool/view,food ok. One night it  rained,so we attempted to bring our drinks into the inside bar,only to be told we are not ALLOWED?? Lots of places nearby to have breakfast,the hotel try to get you to join some scheme to enable breakfast?? I got towels in the up stairs Spa,when our room ones were taken and not replaced. There are many lovely hotels in Athens (Plaka area looks good). Melia was just OK,nothing special.\n",

We walked the streets and saw less crime and begging than I saw in other cities like Rome or New York.    The Melia is the old Recience Georgio and it is a beautiful property at a great price. The front desk staff is pretty to look at but not overly friendly and I was surprised the hotel does not have a porter so we had to drag our bags up ourselves (no big deal we had been back packing for 3 weeks).

The building itself is stunning.    You do pay a bit more for this hotel, but what you receive in return is certainly worth the investment.  Their café is great, as well as their restaurant.  However, where you get your money’s worth is at their rooftop lounge.  The view is spectacular and the service we had was perfect.  The hotel is conveniently located to several attractions and the metro.  If you chose to stay at this hotel (which I recommend) the metro goes directly from the airport just half a block outside the hotel, so I suggest you take the metro and save yourself a lot of time and money.\n",

The general facilities is not bad... except the hotel corridor can be quite claustrophobic. Worst is when some one is smoking.The room and shower facility is decent and above average... There was no kettle but there was nespresso machine without the pods or even tea bags.  Even a service station hotel provide that.

But you cannot compare this to other similar hotels because it has one extraordinary feature: the most amazing rooftop bar with views of the whole city and of the Acropolis.  The cocktails are quite pricey at 12EUR but it's worth it for the amazing view.  There's also an infinity pool on the roof for the daytime, although it isn't deep.  I would recommend you book this compared to any other chain hotel in the city.  It's not every day you can drink a Long Island Iced Tea in the evening with a view of the Acropolis!\n",

Admittedly the neighborhood of Omonia Square isn't the best (putting it lightly) but you're just a block away from Akademias street which is a safe path to some nicer neighborhoods and eventually the Byzantine and War Museums (head East on Vasilissis Sofias).  The rooftop bar was very nice, relaxing and played some low-key lounge-style music.  It definitely was an oasis in the center of Athens and the view of the Acropolis continued to draw our eyes throughout the night.  There's also a set of binoculars on a tripod pointed towards Lycabettus so you can also see the church lit up at night.  +1 for not minding me setting up a tripod and taking some pics of the Acropolis.

The rooftop bar with swimming pool is an absolute plus, with a charming view on the Acropolis. The only negative sides, if there are some, is that the neighbouring Omonia square area can look a bit rough or scary to tourists, as it looks bombed out and populated with a lively fauna of unfortunate people. Also, do not expect too much from the restaurant menu, it's quite basic and has a wide margin for improvement (do you hear me, Melia management ?)\n",

We enjoyed the restaurant food and bar cocktails were also good. Free wi-fi at the pool area and hotel lobby. You have to pay for wi-fi if accessed from the room - 5 euro for 1 hour and about 15 euro for 24 hours. Overall good value for money and centrally located 4 star hotel. Bravo!\n",

Both rooms we had were well-furnished and very clean.  All staff were very helpful.  The rooftop pool is great for cooling down after a day's sightseeing.  Good view of Acropolis.  The hotel is 5 minutes from the Archeological Museum (both open-top bus tours stop there), 5 minutes from Omonia Square with a metro stop and a fifteen minute walk to Syntagma Square, so in a convenient spot.  The immediate area around the hotel is a bit run-down.  There are beggars on the street and a few junkies too but I never came across any trouble or felt concerned for our safety.   A walk via Akedemia was spectacular for the buildings there.  A 12 euro ticket gets…\n",

A taxi was provided and it was not very far away.  Reception staff were very nice and upgaded us to a superior room with Spa bath.  The hotel was very clean and elegantly furnished.  The rooftop bar and pool looked very nice, but the pool is closed from 6pm, so we didn;'t get to use it.  Breakfast was included and there was a very good good selection from the buffet.  After breakfast, reception organised us a taxi back to Hotel Novus City (which Novus City paid for).

They were all happy to help you make the most of your visit. For me, that was very important because they put their guests first consistently. And the best experience came when I actually got there, to find the rooms very clean and spacious, with spa & jacuzzi facilities included. I agree that wifi would of been nice to be available in the room, but the hotel lobby was so cozy that I actually had no problems spending my time there for internet connection.

It's about a 5 minute walk to Omonia Square, and only about a 20 minute walk to Plaka, Monasteraki and the other central tourist areas. The Roof Garden is a delight - a great place to hang out after a long hot day sight-seeing, with a simply stunning view of the Acropolis at night-time. The rooms are well appointed, with the quietest air conditioning system I've ever experienced, and friendly helpful staff. I'd definitely stay there again on my next visit to Athens. I thought the breakfast a little pricey at €18, and the bar prices perhaps a little high (€8 for a half litre beer) - but then this is a 4-star hotel, so I guess that's to be expected.\n",

Room, pool, rooftop bar, restaurants, etc. For those concerned, the neighborhood is fine. Really. It may look a little down and out on first glance, but it really is fine and comes alive during the day. The hotel is a few short metro stops from the tourist attractions and night spots. For those unfamiliar with Athens who are coming from the Airport, my recommendation is to take a taxi to the hotel upon your arrival. Some will disagree because of the cost (fixed rate is 35 euro including tolls and luggage), but finding the hotel in an unfamiliar area is one less thing to worry about after a long flight.

      "Review is :After reading the reviews from some of the people that have previously booked the Melia Athens, I assumed the area would be like downtown Beirut or maybe the Bronx. Nothing could be further than the truth. Trust me; if this area worries you,  you shouldn’t ever walk out of your front door. I walked to the Hotel from the Metro at 11.30 pm and the walk took me five minutes through very busy, very well lit streets.  Yes, sure, the area is a bit down at heel but so is the rest of Athens.  The city centre is lovely but as you radiate away, there is evidence of closed shops and graffiti. The city is a pretty picture in a dirty frame.  However, there is absolutely no sense of threat and I’d be much more worried walking through central London at night. As for the hotel, what at amazing…\n",

There are lots of cafes, stores, restaurants in the area during the day. 15-20 minute walk to decent tourist areas. Staff was helpful but I wouldn't say they went above and beyond my expectations. Roof top bar was closed late April, so I cannot comment on it. Great breakfest with the best fruit I have ever had.  I read reviews on the area so I knew it wasn't the greatest. As a young adult, I look for nightlife and it didn't exist in the area. During the day, the area is fine, a little sketchy but not concerning. At night shady characters can be seen walking about like drug induced zombies but they are not threating just smelly,…\n",

Perhaps the really exciting part of it the roof top terrace and pool was closed for maintenance - which is a good thing, that it is well maintained, I was just too unfortunate to stay right then. The location is good, within walking distance to the metro. The Level room showed a bit of wear and tear, but was still o.k. The only downside was breakfast: Although the hotel wasn't sold out, they struggled to accomodate all the guest and to refill the buffet.\n",

We arrived at the hotel around 9:45pm and as we were bringing our luggage into the hotel, one of our suitcases got trapped in the revolving doors and we struggled to get it. I gestured helplessly to the reception and caught the lady's eye, but she just looked down at the computer screen and pretended she didn't see anything. In the end, our taxi driver, who was about to drive away, got out of his car to help us push the heavy revolving doors so we could get our luggage out and helped us move the remaining suitcases into the hotel lobby.

The Melia Athens is a very nice 4star hotel at a low rate.  Positive: The Melia is located very central at Omonia. Omonia is not the nicest neighbourhood, but i never felt unsafe. You can easliy walk to Kolonaki, Plaka, Monastraki and Gazi. Concerning the service, our check-in at 2am was superfast and friendly. Rooms are nice with good beds and clean bathrooms.  Negative:  My room (702) was facing a light shaft with a ventilation. I had to keep the window closed because the ventilation was too loud.

There is some shadiness, but it's a trade off for how close it is to everything. It's within walking distance of all major sites. This is important as many times the bus and metro are shut down from strikes. You just have to make sure you are smart about where you walk.\n",

I’m sure that some people, especially those more used to the five star treatment, might be put off by the locale, but to be honest, the location is ok . . . . sure it certainly has a bit of an edge to it, and yes you will see down and outs and druggies, but generally nothing you wouldn’t find in many capital cities across the globe.

The shower was a bit of a novelty and took a few minutes to figure out - was one if those spa ones! There was even a phone in the bathroom!!!  The staff were excellent - really friendly & helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is not far from the underground train system and also within walking distance, well for me, of a lot of major attractions. Rooftop pool and views a bonus! Highly recommended.\n",

The large lounge area next to reception is often occupied by people on laptops researching this and that (us inlcuded) so it would be much nicer if the bar/coffee shop was open for refreshments.

Unfortunately the pool was closed, but this was notified beforehand (and only because we went out of season).   My one and only criticism would be the location.

The hotel cafe, Cafe Mondo serves- in my opinion- the best Greek coffee in Athens. Ommonia is heavily patrolled by the police so I actually felt pretty safe in this area. Wifi in the rooms is 8 euros an hour but they have free wi-fi in the lobby. Their gym is quite small but their sauna and steam room is really nice. The rooftop pool and bar is wonderful.

The rooftop pool is inviting, as is the health spa/sauna/gym on the roof. The view of the Acropolis lit up at night while you eat inviting meals capped of a great place to stay.\n",

The location of this hotel would be excellent for the majority of the tourist sights in Athens if it were not for the large number of homeless persons and drug addicts that litter the route. Despite growing up and working in London I have never seen anything like it.  We are well travelled and I must say it is not somewhere that I would venture out alone at night. With that out of the way I have got to say that the hotel itself was excellant.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.

There was free wifi in the lobby and the rooftop bar, it would have been nice if this also extended out to the rooms. The best feature of this hotel is the rooftop pool, which offers a great respite and chance to cool down after a long day of sightseeing in Athens, with a view of the Acropolis as you sip your cocktail.

The poolside terrace on the roof top provides you with some of the best views of the Acropolis, Lycabettus Hill and the rest of the city with no obstructions in the way.   The room was quite luxurious with a much superior quality to most other places within the same price range. The bed was extremely comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was also very clean and impressive.   One major downside was the substandard quality of food being served.

Some of the complaints I read about, like high internet prices in the room, or high restaurant prices can be dealt with by connecting from the lobby, and eating out, respectively. In my opinion, of six hotels visited in June in Greece, this one was the best value. Unfortunately, the Omonia neighborhood where the hotel is located is pretty bad. After dark, it becomes a desert but even at day time walking around it is nerve-wrecking. You basically need to use the taxi on the way out, and in, particularly when with luggage. I tried the metro, and had my wallet stolen (this happened not in the hotel's immediate neighborhood, but on the no. 1 metro line going to Omonia).\n",

For the price I actually paid for my room and given the perfect location of the Hotel within easy walking distance of the Greek Parliament in the main square as well as being 5 mins walk away from the Archeological Museum and 3 mins walk away from a Metro station providing easy access to all major hot spots in Athens you really cannot do much better than the Melia Athens Hotel.

The pillows weren't so comfortable but all the rest was great. The highlights are: modern, clean, very central location (about 15mins by foot to Acropole area and 5mins to parliament) and roof terrace is an amazing surprise: with a long and narrow pool, bar and affordable restaurant. We'll definitively go back if we're in Athens.\n",

We arrived at 1000 in the morning not really expecting to be checked in at that hour but a room was available and we were checked in straight away. I realise that they could not normally do this but most hotels would just send you away until the afternoon. Altogether a good stay only negative was that a taxi driver could not find it as the spelling translation of the street name from Greek alphabet seems to vary.\n",

The rooftop restaurant was still open and it offers beautiful views of the Acropolis and the food is also quite good as well.

This is an excellent feature of the hotel but at 6.30 they get everyone out of pool and close the pool area while they \"get it ready for the evening\". You then cannot get up there until 8.00pm.

      "Review is :Athens in July is an abandoned city which made staying at the Melia make even more sense. The hotel is very close to Omonia square and only a 10 minute walk from Syntagma square. Despite the former squares' crime ridden reputation and the latter squares' reputation for uninspiring tourist shops and restaurants, both squares are the only vibrant zones during the July-August heat.  The room was small yet tastefully designed with large mirrors that gave it a spacious feel. The Bathroom was small but very appealing to the eye and the airconditioner was effective and quiet. The roof top pool treats you to wonderful views of the Acropolis. The small gym was the only main concern - it was impossible to cool because its made of sun attracting glass. I complained of the boiling (right…\n",

We then had to wait around for about 1/2 an hour - during which time we met another couple who had been told exactly the same story.

Okay, you may not break your next, but you will fall into the pool with your clothes on. - The breakfast is expensive, but good choice of food.

When you book ask for a room with an outside view though, as on our first stay here our room only had an 'indoor' window and so we had to have the light on all the time to be able to see which was a bit of a shame in the middle of summer! The roof top pool is fantsatic, with views over the Acropolis, as well as a jacuzzi.  The hotel is located in a bit of a seedy area-we passed prostitutes and people taking drugs on our way to the metro station. However it is very conveniently located to see the sights. Plaka and the Acropolis can be reached in a few minutes on the metro and tickets only cost one Euro.  Overall a very nice hotel.\n",

However the minute we arrived there we realised why it was so reasonable. it was in the middle of an area called omonia which locals refer to as junkie palace and local greek people not only in athens but around greece know not to go there. it was descibed to be worse then camden by a young athenian boy studying in london and in his words more in the scale of whitechapel in east london.  Being two girls there we felt very unsafe and the hotel staff themselves said not to go out after 9pm and even then to stick to main roads.  The hotel was lovely but as it changed its name recently many…\n",

      "Review is :checked in with my wife and 16 yr old son for 3 nights through website \"booking.com\". The triple room was a double room with a rollaway bed; knew this before hand so no snags. However, the extra bed was not suitable for anyone older than about 8 yrs old and should certainly not be classed as a triple room. After 1 night duly complained and discovered they did not have anything to offer us in the way of a suitable single bed. Negotiated an upgrade at half-price for the executive suite which featured a sofa-bed that did pull down into a suitable bed. Once i had complained everything sorted brilliantly by the reception staff and the house keeping manager who were all extremely sympathetic. Well done.\n",

Although it is located in the city centre, we found the hotel's location a bit too far from \"where it happens\". Indeed, it is located on a big avenue and not far from Omonia's metro station, but there is nothing going in the area in the evening (except a Starbucks Coffe and an  interesting vegetarian store/cafeteria open till 8 pm). The room was small to my taste, although we booked a Deluxe Double Room (and I precise that we paid its full price).

The hardwood floor in our room was cracked and we would trip over it often when walking, and the carpet and curtains had some stains on it that hadn't been cleaned.

The one night stay prior to the islands was using the special Holiday package that included breakfast, dinner and a welcome cake.  We also received an unexpected fruit basket!  And the jacuzzi could not be beat!!  I never saw a shower like this one.  Our three nights at the end of our island trip were also great, albeit without the included breakfast and dinner.  But the early booking rate was less than half the package rate.  For us, the place and staff were very accomodating.  Some of the recent reviews put a scare into us before checking in.\n",

      "Review is :I booked the Residence Georgio directly through the hotel at their 99 Euro a night advance purchase rate for three nights.  For this rate, we had to pay in advance, with the payment being non-refundable.  I confirmed the reservation twice after making it, including the night before we left for our trip.  When we arrived at the Residence Georgio after a 26 hour trip, we were told there were \"water problems\" that had made a whole floor of rooms unusable, so they needed to move us to another hotel nearby for the first night.  We argued and showed them the repeated confirmation of our reservation, but to no avail.  Even though it was clear the hotel staff was lying to us, and that overbooking was the real problem, we had no recourse having prepaid our rooms, so went to the other…\n",

      "Review is :I stayed one night at the Residence Georgio Hotel after returning to Athens from a 4 night cruise of the Greek Isles. The bed was extremely comfortable. It was a king bed, not the little skinny twin beds you usually get in Europe. The bath was a jacuzzi tub with a shower that had jets. I used the tub and shower to full advantage and after climbing all the hills to see the sights, it was VERY relaxing. I had booked a special rate of 99 Euro by booking 21 days in advance. The location is OK, not the greatest, but you are pretty close to a metro stop, about 4 blocks away. I would stay there again because of the rooms and bath. It was fantastic. Prior to my cruise, I had stayed 6 nights at the Grande Bretagne Hotel in Athens. It was nice and the location was great, but I really…\n",

Barthroom comes with a jaccuzi tub. For the 90 euro we paid it was a great value for money. It is 2 mins walk to the metro station Sonomia , 5 mins walk to the National museum and a 15 mins walk to Plaka via Sygtama square which is good to see.

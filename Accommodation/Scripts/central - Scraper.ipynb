They even provided complimentary Greek snack & Greek liquor in the room which I thought was a nice touch.  Breakfast was standard but the rooftop bar restaurant was over the top.  Nice place to unwind after walking up to the Acropolis/Museum which is only about a 10mn walk and the bar closes late.  Great location with the Plaka District just down the block.  There is a school next door, so at times the school bell rings but I kinda did not mind it.\n",

A very warm welcome despite the time, efficient check in and straight to our room. Hadn’t expected an Acropolis view but got one which was a nice touch for my partner as it was his first trip to Greece.  Nice clean room and decent bathroom (something which can be challenging in Athens). We only booked for that one night, but check out was efficient and polite and they stored our bags for us so we had time to look around before moving on to our final destination.\n",

I even called the hotel but they didn’t have my booking because it was done through a third-party. I booked it through a third-party because there were no rooms available through the hotel. When I eventually arrived at the hotel for five nights that I had already paid for,  I was sent to my standard room which was an interior room which I did not know and it looked onto an ugly wall 2 feet away from the window. It was so small and so depressing. Zero art on the wall, no tissues, no hairdryer and a tiny box that you couldn’t even open a suitcase in. I stayed one night out of the five nights but had to pay for all five nights. I couldn’t wait to get out of there and of course no refund was given. I did ask to change rooms but they were full and told me I had to wait two days until reservations was opened again to see if there was any possibility of changing rooms. Needless to say there were no pictures on their website of what my standard room looked like or  what the outlook looked like. Absolutely horrible. I have provided a picture of the room.,…\n",

Afternoon checkin staff are lovely. The morning team are more functional.  Breakfast is a good selection.  The room was a good size but the bathroom a little compact.  Bedding comfortable and air con worked well.  Our acropolis view room did provide a view but you have to open the window and lean out to see it.  Wifi signal was weak and dropped out several times.  We were on level 6 which is immediately below the rooftop restaurant. You can hear sliding of tables and chairs through dinner service until the small hours then about dawn I presume the cleaning crew take over to do their jobs.  I suspect I’d be much happier on any floor apart from level 6.…\n",

Drinks were good and my chicken/pasta dish was excellent! Did I mention the view? The breakfasts had several options-fill up here and head out into the city for the day!

The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is good. We choose this hotel due to the position near to all the great places Athens has to offer.

Definitely worth it to have a drink there at night!  Besides the rooftop bar, also the location is great. It’s surrounded with good restaurants (Noodlebar and Sushimou I can recommend) and all the famous historical sites can be reached by foot within 15 minutes of the hotel.

The room was dirty too, old curtains and linen. Bed mattress is hard, unable to get a good nights sleep. Hotel service is poor, they do the bare minimum but not much more to assist.The staff seem dis-interested. Breakfast is poor quality buffet, food all seems cheap and processed.  Would definately not stay again, tried to leave after 1 night but as we had pre-paid they refused to refund other nights accomodation.\n",

The hotel itself is very neat and professionally managed. The staff are courteous. The rooms are spacious, well designed and clean. The one we were in had a small balcony good enough to get a sunset view and a view of the acropolis top.  The roof top bar and restaurant is a great place to spend the evening during sunset. Get some good food, drinks and sunset photographs.  The wifi is excellent.\n",

The staff is really helpful with a special remind of Nikos who knowing that we'd leave the hotel before the breakfast time prepared a special treat, a bag with apples, yogurt, orange juice and a a couple of sandwiches. Very thoughtful. I highly recommend the place if you're looking for a good hotel at a fair price.\n",

As we were in need of a room in Athens for 1 night, we followed her recommendation and booked a room. The roof terrace and the view is undoubtedly stunning. The location is great; just a minutes walk from Plaka. Not so good for parking, though. We could not even find space to unload our luggage. Had to just stop the traffic. We left our car at a paying parking on the side street. The hotel itself is modern and clean. We were upgraded to a room on the 6th floor and I strongly recommend that you choose…\n",

The AC barely worked, considering the high summer temperatures in Athens, it was very difficult to sleep, on top of this the bed was uncomfortable. In fact, we booked a room with a queen bed, and found out that they had joined two twin beds and made them into one. We actually contacted the hotel in advance regarding an early check in because we were taking a red eye fight, but they didn't bother to accommodate us, so we had to wait hours for our room to be ready until regular check in times. Basically, if you decide to stay here, you will be paying for the location, and the views from their restaurant terrace. Ah the breakfast was actually pretty good.\n",

We stayed in a standard double room, double bed, bathroom with shower and toilet, wardrobe with safe, tv, telephone, tea, coffee and kettle also a small bar fridge. We stayed here on our arrival in Greece, then the day before we left for home. Breakfast was very good, cold meats and cheese, cereals, sweet cakes, bacon, eggs etc, tea coffee, juices. Very friendly service by all the staff. The hotel was not far from Parliament, Apollo and the Acropolis, short walk to each of these.\n",

The air conditioning sucked so much! I would turn it up all the way and after hours of the A/C on the room was still hot and muggy and it seems I’m not the only guest that had this problem. The next thing I would let future guest know is that the “complimentary breakfast” wasn’t so good, the sausage was nasty, bacon was nearly raw (not crispy at all) and the eggs were so soft and mushy it was gross. Basically anything that was not a croissant was pretty disappointing. There was no pool nor hot tub instead they have a lounge on the roof which is very nice, although I would rather have a small pool on…\n",

We were too tired to change rooms. Opening the window was not an option as we were above some exhaust from a kitchen and the room would stink.

We turned up to the hotel and the outside it’s opposite a busy food market which is lovely, a nicer sight to see every morning.  But the location of the hotel is excellent, a 15-20 minute walk from the acropolis and Plaka and a 5 minute walk from Monastiraki. But the area where it’s located is where all the immigrants live.  I’m far from a snob but it’s dirty, dark and full of men leering around, it made me and my family very uneasy walking back here at night, so keep an eye on your pockets. The lobby is nothing spectacular but sometimes simple is better, we went to check in and the man was rather rude behind reception as he didn’t understand much…\n",

We had a view of the Acropolis from our window on the fifth floor and the terrace bar upstairs has a great view as well, although they weren’t particularly welcoming when we went to look when we first arrived.  It’s a shame they don’t offer guests a complimentary glass of wine up there to encourage patronage.  Instead there is complimentary liqueur in the small clean rooms with good mattresses and hot shower.  Reception staff were efficient but not overly friendly.   Breakfast was on the lower floor in a big well decorated modern restaurant area, however the food was average.  If I could have given 3 1/2 I would have but it’s definitely not s 4 in my opinion.\n",

If you had breakfast, you wouldn't have to eat until dinner.  The attractions of the Plaka district are a short walk away, namely restaurants and the touristy shops as well as the Flea markets. Syntagma square was also a short walk away, with many buses having a stop there, including the X96 to the airport, which was 6 euros, whereas the Subway to the airport was 10 Euros.\n",

      "Review is :Stayed at this hotel in Athens for 4 days in the middle of February.  The neighborhood is quaint and offers views of the Acropolis from the rear of the hotel.  Unfortunately the roof bar/restaurant was under construction during our visit - scheduled to be finished in mid March so upcoming visitors will be the first to enjoy the renovations.  The hotel is truly centrally located - we were able to walk to all subway lines within 10 minutes.  There are multiple restaurants in the local neighborhood and the Plaka/Flea Market area are within a 10 minute walk as well.  An additional 20 eateries lie within and/or near the Flea Market.  Regarding the hotel, we stayed in a Superior Double Room on the 4th floor.  The room checked off all the boxes - clean, comfy bed, and relatively quiet…\n",

It is an excellent location- in walking distance to the Acropolis, main shoping and tourist area an the the main square of the city and metro station . We have a fantastic night view of the Acropolis from the rooftop bar open I think until 11pm.  One can take a taxi from the airport at Euro 55 but it is easier to take the very efficient and new metro (euro 10) and a short 7 min walk.  from Syntagma Square. There are also buses but it also depends on time of travel . The hotel rooms are very spacious but my room faced inside and saw only some pipes . The room has a good bath , internet and a comfortable bed. The sofa was a bit sunk in possibly by overuse but ok. A nice work…\n",

It was cold and rainy during our stay, so we did not visit the rooftop, unfortunately. This is a pretty big hotel, and the elevator is woefully inadequate (holds two small people, without luggage, at a time). It is clear that guests were smoking in their rooms (despite \"no smoking\" signs) without consequence. But here's the biggie: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PUT A REAL DOOR ON THE BATHROOM.

Our room had a wonderful view of the Acropolis and was very comfortable, with plenty of storage. It was great to have tea making facilities and a fridge as it meant we could nip back during the afternoon for a rest and a 'cuppa'.

      "Review is :My sister, daughter and I stayed here one night while in Athens to see the Acropolis. The positive points are the rooftop bar with a lovely view of the Acropolis, clean room, the nice breakfast & most of the staff. The negatives were the gentleman behind the front desk when we checked in. I don’t know his name but he was very unfriendly and when we asked questions, he gave the impression we were bothering him. We checked in around lunchtime on a Tuesday.  Also, the elevator is, well, ridiculously small. Hopefully no one ever gets stuck in that elevator! The room was quite small and the beds were very hard. Glad we were only there for one night. The location is good but didn’t feel like we were in a very nice area of Athens.\n",

The rooms were enough for us space wise and had a side view to the Acropolis.    We had a little issue with our room the first night where the air did not work.  We were given two fans to get us through the night and were told they would have a technician come out in the morning.  If that didn't fix it they would move us to another room.  We survived the first night once we got fans!  The next morning we were moved to another room right next to the first one.  The air was much better!  I find it interesting that the next night someone else was in our \"broken\" room.  Maybe they got it fixed.  I hope!

Would be better if it had baked beans for the cooked breakfast but they rarely do in Europe.  P.s. Would recommend a day/half day trip to Sounion. Public bus is 12.50 EUR return (pay on board). Go to the nearest corner of Syntagma square and turn right a little, bus stop and kiosk with the bus times just there.\n",

The good points:   great location, friendly staff, good price compared to other hotels in the area, breakfast included, nice balcony, free wifi.   The bad points:   the lobby smelled badly of smoke, uncomfortable bed.     Fortunately our room and the breakfast area did not smell like smoke.

And the absolute best feature are the extraordnary, breathtaking views of the Acropolis from the roof terrace.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because there is just one ridiculously small lift (3 'normal size' people just about fit) to serve 7 floors.

      "Review is :We stayed here for a couple of nights to do some sightseeing in Athens before setting off for the islands.  The location is perfect with just about everything being reachable on foot if you choose (it was hot in June though). The hotel entrance is in a side street amongst an outdoor market (fruit, veg and \"antiquities\". This gave it a bit of an unusual ambiance on arrival, but also added character and you felt you were in \"real Greece\". There was no noise from the market which closes early evening.  The hotel generally was quiet and the rooms and bathrooms clean. The desk staff are very helpful and the hotel breakfast buffet more than adequate (and also available very early if you need it). Complimentary tea and coffee is available in reception.  The roof top bar is well worth a…\n",

My advice: is you spending only one night in Athens like we did and don’t mind the super small room then is ok. Rooms are clean, staff super attentive but the real reason to book this hotel besides it’s location is the superb views you’ll have from the rooftop bar especially at night when the Parthenon is illuminated as this hotel has direct views of the Acropolis, that was the best part o& this hotel!  Take a taxi to get to the property as it can be very confusing is you are a first timer there. The hotel is sort of hidden took us a while to find it, other than that…\n",

However the rooftop bar/restaurant has an exceptional view of the acropolis especially at dusk and early night. Great location, 500m easy walk from the Syntagma metro station (for the airport) and 600m easy walk from Monastiriki metro (for Piraeus ferries) but is off from the main tourist shopping streets in Plaka and therefore doesn't get late night noise while still being a short stroll to good restaurants. Good selection at the included continental buffet breakfast. Decent price given the central tourist location of the hotel.\n",

The breakfast buffet provides an ideal start to the day regardless if you are a business traveller or a leisure traveller. And in the evening, one can unwind at the roof top bar over few cocktails, a meal and lover looking at the amazing view of the Acropolis. Staff were friendly and willing to help out. One hotel we will definitely stay again in on our next journey to Athens.\n",

When the lift arrived, I realised they were not kidding. The lift only had sufficient space for 2 adults standing side by side. My fiance and I were thin so we fitted in ok with our luggage. It was a nightmare waiting for the lift each time so we climbed the stairs dutifully each day. Room was clean and comfortable, and location of the hotel was good. We could walk to Syntagma and Monastiraki easily. Area seemed safe at night, even though we met some drunks one night who were disturbing a group of tourists.\n",

The hotel is conveniently situated near Syntagma Square, about 10 minutes walk in the direction of the Plaka area. However, the street in the vicinity of the hotel was decidedly dingy, not at all salubrious. The entrance to the hotel is cold and clinical.  The lift to the rooms is so small that it cannot cope with more than one person and his luggage. Our room was small and faded and the bathroom was likewise small and cramped. We did, however, have glimpses of the Acropolis from our window.   That night was stifling. Our air conditioner did not work.  It was slightly cooler outside but it was too noisy to leave the window open.  The mini refrigerator also did not work.   When we complained at…\n",

We stayed at the Central Hotel for 2 nights (one night (from Ottawa to Greece) and then on our way back home (from Rhodes to Ottawa). Our main concern was the smell of smoke as you entered the lobby (although our room did not smell of smoke). We visited the roof top bar. The views are lovely but don't be caught with your foot on another chair. After a 10 hour flight we headed up to the roof top bar. My friend was tired and put her foot on one of the empty chair rungs. The bartender was quick to point out not to do that. I could see if she put both of her feet up to kick back but it wasn't like that at all...  The last night we stayed, we arrived at 9:00pm and still hadn't eaten so we went out for a bite to…\n",

Breakfast is included which is another bonus and the breakfast had a little bit of everything to keep everyone happy (i.e., fruit, yogurts, eggs, cheese/meats, pastry, etc). For the amount of time I spent in my room, it was more than adequate.  There is a roof top restaurant with an awesome view of the acropolis - great for night photography!

Being close to things in all directions was so convenient.  Yet the location was on a quiet street.  We had a deluxe room on the 5th floor with a view of the Parthenon on the Acropolis.  Granted you had to put your chair next to the window in order to spend time looking, but that was easy enough.  If the price is acceptable, I would definitely get the view room.

The a/c unit was super loud, we had to turn it on and off to be able to sleep! The worst part, the staff didn’t care!! I told them of the problems, and I basically got a shoulder shrug, not even an attempt at a fake apology! The hotel was in a centralized location, so it was easy to get to the Acropolis and the city center!  It was clean, and parts of the hotel were very modern and interesting!  I wouldn’t return to this hotel, but it was better than sleeping in the airport!\n",

Close to a laundry (pay by the kilo for wash and dry). Small elevator (3 person max). Breakfast has a good selection.  Acropolis view rooms are great. The rooftop bar is really good. My only problem is that the front desk staff can be snobbish.  Example: asked about room availability for the following week. The young front desk staff jumped right on it, banging away at their terminal. Then an older person at the front desk said something in Greek and they immediately stopped. Then the older person told me that I needed to contact the reservations dept and gave me the email to send my inquiry to. Later on that…\n",

Clean rooms and great breakfast to fuel you for the day of walking about.  Can’t ignore how great the view of the Acropolis was at sundown from the rooftop bar.  One last thing, the jacuzzi available on the rooftop isn’t hot, but ice cold. One hell of a surprise in the cool evening (good thing the Mrs and I didn’t just jump right in!)\n",

Breakfast was included in the rate and was a good selection of cereals and hot food.  The best thing about this hotel though has to be the rooftop terrace. We where pretty gutted the jacuzzi was closed for the season however it was nice to sit in the sun and just take in the beautiful views of Athens below us.  Central hotel .... we will be back 😀\n",

The location is great, very close to the center of Plaka and many bars and restaurants are located around.

It took forever to back up the photos  we took during the trip and we couldn’t even watch YouTube decently due to the slowness of their WiFi.  Besides from that, we were very pleased with the location, service, price and cleanliness of this hotel.  I also wanted to note that the breakfast had a good…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed four nights at this hotel which is a short walk from Syntagma Square.  Our room was small but had all the amenities you would need.   Who spends time in their hotel room anyway??  The bed was comfortable and the shower easy to use.    Hair dryer was a bonus for me!!!!  Only downer were the towels - not fluffy!!!!    The best bit is the roof terrace which overlooks the Acropolis - lit up at night.    I couldn't get enough of the view.   Lovely bar staff as well.  Front of house staff were always ready to help with all the questions we kept asking them.    Internet is very flaky in the rooms but they do have two computers downstairs, one hooked up to a printer, which have better signal.\n",

Reception staff helpful and accommodating  I read some complaints of a 'hard bed'. I like a firm and supportive mattress so that was a plus from my point of view. The only moan was that the wifi was a little slow but that may have been due to room location and didn't cause me any great problems - I wasn't there to spend all day on computer/phone !! I would have no hesitation in returning to this well run establishment.\n",

The location of the hotel is excellent, just a few minutes from Syntagma Square, the Plaka and Mitropoleos. Basically, you can walk to all the essential sites in central Athens from here. The rooms and breakfast are fairly standard for this kind of hotel, but do ask for an Acropolis view when you book. Even if you don’t have one from your room the views from the rooftop bar over the city and across to the Acropolis are wonderful. The bar staff are friendly and helpful, but we found the reception staff to be a little offhand.\n",

Bath Towels really  need replacing, for the price I paid I expect something I can dry myself with, not an expensive item to provide just a basic towel will do, but I could see through these tatty rags, so Hotel urgently needs to improve on this point.

Cold hard fries which had obviously been re heated. Fatty chicken in fact I'm not sure it actually was chicken. We left our meals but waiter didn't seem bothered.

The room iis a shoebox--after we set up my daughter's portable crib (which had to be socked up next to our bed), there was almost nowhere to walk. The mattress was VERY hard--it was like sleeping on barn siding. I was tossing and turning all three nights there.

The elevator was not large enough for the 2 of us and our luggage (1 suitcase each) so one of us had to wait for the elevator to travel all the way up and down or take the stairs, and we were on the 6th floor! I took the stairs always that evening and next morning as I am slightly claustrophobic. The room was nicely designed, but again cramped with not enough room for my…\n",

AMAZING view from the rooftop terrace and great food. Room was a bit small and bed wasn't that comfortable but overall a great stay. Wifi didn't really work the majority of the time though which was big issue when also needing to work while traveling. That was the main issue. Breakfast was AMAZING!!\n",

I and my partner used the hotel as our base in Athens, staying 2 nights initially, and then another 2 nights on different days. The hotel was kind enough to keep items of luggage for us as we travelled about on the mainland and then to a couple of islands. As a result, I was able to experience 3 different rooms: one on the 2nd floor which had no view, and another two on the 6th floor that both had spectacular views of the Acropolis. Although the wifi was not always reliable, I found that this was the case in every hotel I stayed at in Greece. In all other respects this hotel was comfortable and a pleasure to return to each time. The buffet breakfast starting at 7am was certainly plentiful and delicious, while evening drinks…\n",

We requested for a little bit of early check in as the check in was only at 2 PM but three men at the reception had nothing to do with it. We were tired and jet lagged. We waited for 2 hours at the reception, saw many people check in in front of us but may be we are brown skinned and they didnt care for us. The room was only given to us at 2 PM, the room was small like any other hotel in Athens, the bed was so uncomfortable and cheap.

We had very minimal room once we opened our 2 suitcases, and the elevator is tiny as well.

Very comfortable, in spite of rooms being on the typical small side, and the single elevator struggles to accommodate 2 adults and 3 suitcases. Part of the local charm I reckon, and certainly not unusual in central Athens.  Friendly efficient service, good breakfast, and a view to die for from the rooftop bar/restaurant.  Only disappointing thing was the condition of the furniture in that iconic roof bar. Such a shame to let chairs get worn and unkempt.

      "Review is :We stayed here on our last night before we flew back home from vacation and honestly weren't expecting much. This is a very average hotel - nothing special. It's located between Monistiraki Square and Syntagma Square.  The room is average but it's important to note that the bed is absolutely horrendous..probably the most uncomfortable bed we've been in throughout greece. It was two twin beds put together. The wifi at the hotel is pitiful. Shows full strength but will take forever, if at all, to bring up a single webpage or anything else.  The breakfast is ok but shouldn't really expect much wherever you are in Greece unless you go out.  The rooftop terrace is amazing. Perfect view of the Acropolis and has a very nice feel up there.  If you're looking for a hotel with this type…\n",

      "Review is :I think Americans need to temper their expectations when they travel to Europe. Was the room small? Absolutely. Athens is a city that is literally thousands of years old and this hotel is in the heart of it. We walked through the Plaka and had a fabulous dinner. There's a rooftop hot tub and restaurant at the hotel too. The breakfast was amazing. It had anything you could think of. The staff spoke English.  Pros: You can basically walk anywhere from here. We took the subway from the airport and walked from Sygmata square here. Maybe 10 minutes? We had giant luggage and managed just fine. The hotel is air and that worked really well.  Cons: Yes. It is a small room.\n",

The room was not overly spacious and the mattresses were firm to hard.The cleanliness of the room was excellent. The staff at the front desk were very professional and helpful, the cafeteria staff was also top notch as was the staff at the roof terrace bar. The view from the roof terrace bar was spectacular and I would definitely book this hotel again in the future.\n",

Cool view, cool cocktails, cool service. You can also sit inside the bar with aC and still get the great view. The elevator ....oh the elevator.

The view of the Acropolis from the top floor is great, and there's a deck and jacuzzi for relaxing. The Plaka is hectic and noisy but probably the best area to stay in Athens. Internet was slow and they do have a small business center where you can do some internet searches if necessary. Front desk was helpful and always staffed.

I stayed there twice on one vacation--before and after trips to the islands. The first room was a bit snug, but it had a killer view of the Acropolis! The furnishings are new, and the bathrooms are modern and well-supplied with toiletries. Good quality linens, good lighting, and an in-room refrigerator added to our comfort.

Went to rooftop bar during the day. Bartender was consistently sitting in a chair in the back rather than helping patrons. Had to go find him for service.   Came back from a full day of touring. Room was not cleaned. Really?   Elevator is a joke. It is so small and slow. We were coming down for breakfast one morning (5 stories) and got out and walked the last 3 stories because a couple with their luggage was waiting.  Buyer be ware.

The location is close to everything. When we arrived late, staff was only too glad to call upstairs and ask that they help us with a late dinner at the gorgeous rooftop bar, welcoming us not only with food (good) but with THAT VIEW! Yes, the block looks rather seedy, and there is a regular asleep in a storefront on the block most of the time. However, I never felt unsafe, even at night.

We stopped over in Athens for 3 days to see the great ancient sites and just needed a place to sleep. But the paper thin walls won’t let you do that if you have chatty neighbors. We heard every word they said….until 3am. Exhausting! An issue that will keep us from coming back to this hotel. Thankfully there are plenty of others.\n",

The Hop on Hop Off Bus stopped near the hotel. The hotel was perfect for our purpose, but the room wasn't much larger than a cell. My husband kept saying from his cart, \"It is clean and safe.\"  I had expect one double bed but we had two small carts instead. But we had a wonderful breakfast which was included daily. I would return.\n",

Mostly friendly staff at front desk Good location Included breakfast is good Reasonably priced Good view from roof Refrigerator The Cons: The wi-fi is worse than terrible.  Operating at dial-up speeds it is often not available and is not acceptable for streaming.  Hence my comment about \"not suitable for business people.\" The room is tiny even by \"European Standards.\"  It is about the size of a large cell.  A mirror has been provided at the end of the bed ( look at your own bum ) to make the room look larger. The \"mattress\" is a six-inch pad on a slab.  You can sleep just as well from the floor. The elevator is designed for three people.  If you are above the first floor you will most likely have to use the stairs.  Every one wants to use…\n",

The staff were all great, very helpful and friendly. Thank you guys!  However, I have to say that I was expecting a larger, smarter room for the 150 euros/night (superior room with terrace, prepaid, non-refundable). Our room on the 5th floor was basic and very reminiscent of what I used to get on a Thomson package holiday to the islands, tiny with a terrace where you could lie on your towel and get a tan. Our guidebook says that the Central is one of the best value hotels in the Plaka so I can only assume that central Athens hotel prices are skyhigh. The bed takes up most of the room. The aircon struggled at full blast even in mid-May but I…\n",

I wasn't sure whether the photos were going to be an actual representation of what we would see, but my expectations were far exceeded! You really do have that terrific of a view. We left quite early on our departure day (6am) and the staff was kind enough to arrange a very punctual taxi for us the night before.

I expect Europeans bathrooms to be small and that's fine, but the bathroom door was just a swinging piece of frosted glass that didn't go all the way to the floor.  There was also a frosted glass window between the bathroom and the room.  It wouldn't be an issue if you were traveling alone, but it could be awkward with friends.  Plus the whole room lights up at night if someone uses the bathroom.\n",

I was on the third floor and the view was the back of a school and other buildings but I wasn't in the room much so it didn't matter to me on this occasion. The bathroom was small but modern and, most importantly, clean. However, I had no idea that toilet paper shouldn't be flushed down the toilet in Greece so be aware.

The accompanying bathroom is not small but has a quite small shower.

Enjoyed the roof terrace for the sunset with a direct view to the acropolis and athens  From this hotel you can walk to acropolis and the shopping streets and fleet market  Good location\n",

Excellent Location:  In the middle of the city and within walking distance to local transportation and the city's delightful sites.  Views of the Acropolis from our room and watching the moon rise over the Acropolis from the rooftop bar are Amazing - this must-do selfie simply begs to be taken!  We had so much fun walking throughout the city because the location of the Central Athens Hotel made it so easy to explore.  Staff:  The hotel staff are very helpful and kind.

We were initially surprised by the small size of the room and bathroom - but we quickly got used to it. Everything was beautifully clean, with great air conditioning so we slept perfectly. The breakfast was great including hot & cold items, ( cakes, breads, cheeses, yogurts, cereal, seeds, nuts, etc ) and the staff were very helpful.  The hotel was surrounded by great restaurants and cafes. It was walking distance to everywhere.... 5 mins to the main street, the flea market, the changing of the guard, the tour buses, etc.\n",

It is perfect for tourists because the centre of Plaka is where the hop-on-hop-off bus tours start (highly recommend for an easy way to get to all the main sites without costing a fortune). The view from our room was of the Parthenon which was incredible. The room itself was small but perfect for just coming home to shower and sleep although the rooms do not have a cooling system, only heating so it got quite warm in the afternoons and at night. The rooftiop car is fantastic and great for a meal and a drink if you don't want to go out but don't want to just order take away and again, the views are superb.\n",

The Hotel staff are nice, the hotel it's very clean, our room have Acropolis view, Amazing ! The breakfast it's really good, good choice of everything hot and cold. The roof bar is a must ! The view is breathtaking. We stay 4 nights and we went to the roof bar every night. the image of the Acropolis at night from the roof bar it's going to be on my memory forever, I love it! If a visit Athens again I choose this hotel. We have a wonderful stay. The only cons is the elevator it's very small, only to people with luggage fit. That's don't bother us, we only used at arrive and leave because the luggage.The other time we take the stairs.\n",

Doesn't feel private at all.  - the beds are really hard. If you get a double bed, they are just two beds pushed together (which is usually fine) - but the join in these is really hard!

Aside from those minor negatives, the beds are comfortable, housekeeping is very good, the breakfast buffet is all anyone could ask for, and the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is about 5 blocks from Syntagma Square (subway and bus stop from airport) and perhaps 10 blocks from Monastariki Square. It's also walking distance to the Acropolis.

We opted to stay in this area to maximize our time seeing the sights and not hassle with going back and forth to and from the port each day, and I'm glad we did. The location of the hotel is perfect for getting to all the major sites and historic and shopping areas, though the street the hotel is on is quite nondescript and not busy. The room was simple, spacious and clean. We enjoyed having a drink at the rooftop bar with a view of the beautiful Parthenon at night. The breakfast was good, with very efficient service. We didn't have any special needs for the staff. As many others have commented, the elevator is comically small, though with just a small overnight bag this wasn't an issue…\n",

The room and en suite were not on the large size but they suited all of our needs and they had all of the essentials that we required. The breakfast was large and was a great addition to our wonderful stay at Central Athens Hotel. Without doubt the jewel in the crown of this hotel is the roof top bar and its view.

Its fun at night and the view of the Acropolis is so nice.  Now the the jacuzzi was fun.  Yes it's NOT hot but I looked at it as a refreshing little pool during the day.

Solid buffet breakfast with lots of choice: no eggs made to order though. Modern and fresh feel. Friendly and effciient welcome at the reception. Nice terrace with view of Parthenon, all that at a quite reasonable price.  So what's wrong? 1. rooms are on the small side, acceptable but barely. 2. Internet: bad, bad, bad. It took anywhere from 1-30 seconds to load a page, except of course at 2 am when no one else is using the web.  Would have had a fourth star, except for Internet.\n",

The hotel is located in the Plaka sector, charming and with many restaurants and places to explore. It is at a walking distance from the main attractions, Acropolis, museums, etc in Athens. The bar/restaurant upstairs was pricey. You will be better off exploring Plaka restaurants and saving the bar for drinks late at night; you will not regret it!

Two people cannot use it at once unless one person stands over the toilet and bends to the side to see in the mirror.

      "Review is :First of all the good: The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly.  The roof top bar and view of the Acropolis is fabulous .  The jacuzzi is set at a low temp and perfect for cooling off after a hot day.  The location is \"central\" although not very picturesque.  The bad:  the rooms are too small.  The bathroom is mini with a sink more like an airplane sink.  The rooms are hot and never really cool off although the lobby is very cool so you know they could do better in the rooms if they wanted to.  The elevator holds 2 people, 3 max and if more squeeze in, it won't move.  With the roof top bar attraction many people are using it at night and a line forms on every floor.  It may take half an hour to finally get a ride up to your room.  I finally walked up 5 flights in disgust. …\n",

The hotel staff very friendly and accommodating to all our needs which I considered very endearing.  The location was more than I could ask for, it was walking distance to anywhere we wanted to go. Plenty of shops and restaurants, the food was excellent. What I enjoyed the most, was the most incredible view from the rooftop lounge, especially at night, you could almost reach out and touch the Acropolis. I would definitely highly recommend this hotel to anyone, I enjoyed my stay there very much.\n",

After a day of business or sight seeing, you must relax at the rooftop garden lounge/restaurant with full service. The view is amazing and the drinks are delicious. Best Greek Mojito ever!

My partner is claustrophobic, so we took the stairs which wasn't so bad as their nice, well lit and are a well used part of the hotel (rather than just a fire escape). Rooftop bar is awesome. Looks straight out the acropolis which is spectacular at night. If I could give a decimal score I would give 4.5/5. I think you would struggle to find a better place to stay in Athens.\n",

The room was very clean, had a spectacular view of the Acropolis, was within walking distance to the Acropolis, to the busy street in Plaka, the central Market (where fish and meat are sold), had a terrific rooftop terrace with very affordable drinks (5 euros for a class of wine) and a fun but not pretentious vibe. It was also within 2 mins of the main shopping street, \"Ermou\" where local and international brands line the cobblestone street.  Nikko (I believe that was his name) working the front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating.   The breakfast spread was incredible - so many options to choose from!  The rooftop hot tub wasn't \"hot\" per North American standards nor was that deck area particularly exciting, but at least…\n",

The rooms are quite small, but very clean - we had a great view of the Acropolis on our second stay . The breakfast was plentiful, one of the best we've had in Greece.  The roof top terrace is absolutely fabulous, during the day or at night, and is exactly like the pictures.  The walk to the entrance to the Acropolis is about 20 minutes. We would recommend this hotel.\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is down a side street about 2 minutes walk from the main square where the Hop-on Hop-off buses go from. You are within walking distance of the markets, the restaurants in the Plaka and Monastiraki and you can walk to many of the main sites. Taxis can get down the street but bigger vehicles can't. The rooms are clean but on the small side and you either get a city view or an Acropolis view. There is a small bar area on the top floor with a fabulous view of the Acropolis but the snack food on offer isn't up to much. The hotel's worst feature is probably it's extremely small (2 people with small suitcases if you're lucky) and extremely slow lift. If you arrive with a group then this means a tortuously slow access to your room. The staff will, however, bring your luggage…\n",

Our room overlooked a small church and we had a partial view of the Acropolis.  There was a chorus and band practicing during the day in the building below us, which was enjoyable to us since we are music lovers, but may have been annoying for people who like peace and quiet.

It was the final night of our 8 nights in Greece so we had stayed at other hotels in Athens, which gave us some comparison perspective. Overall, I would say Central Hotel was the most convenient location at which we stayed as it was a close walk to food and attractions. It was also in what seemed like a safe area, so don't be thrown off by the graffiti all over the nearby buildings. The interior was clean and modern in appearance. The individuals working at the front desk were quick to check us in and out. We stayed in a Superior Room with a view of the Acropolis. Our view was unobstructed which made for a special sight at night. The room was clean, well air-conditioned and quiet. The free breakfast in the morning was filling,…\n",

There is an extensive amount of graffiti throughout the entire city of Athens, sad that the youth of Greece find the need to tag literally everything that does not move.  The view of the Parthenon from the rooftop terrace is amazing once the sun sets and the lights come on.  Service and food were both exceptional.  Only downside was the elevator built for two.

One can enjoy a cup of greek coffee or a cold beer in a relaxed chair in the late afternoon. Far away from traffic, noise and people thet want to sell something. Here you can see a fabulous sunset and lights that are reinforcing the mirage of Parthenon. By night the Acropolis is like a gem shining innthe Athenian night.

      "Review is :I stayed here with a friend in early May for a week - the hotel is superbly located in Plaka but not right in the main tourist hub, easy walk to the restaurants, shops and main sites - we walked everywhere and did not once use the metro. We walked back late at night and felt perfectly safe. We hired a car for 3 days to travel out of Athens and used the hotel car park free of charge. We had a twin room and although a small room had plenty of room for both our suitcases etc, and the room was clean and tidy every day. Good selection of food and juices at breakfast. The major highlight of the hotel is the roof terrace bar. The view of the Acropolis is stunning in the day and at night, make sure you watch the sunset here, it is very magical. They also make the best cocktails in…\n",

      "Review is :We spent 4 nights at the Central Hotel between April 6-10 and had a wonderful experience.  We flew in from Santorini one day earlier due to flight delays and the hotel was able to accommodate us for the extra night.  The hotel was moderately busy and even so they were able to offer us a great room location with a view of the Acropolis.  Given how Euro city rooms are normally, the room was quite spacious, relatively speaking, and were very clean.  The bathroom was slightly on the smaller side but relative to city rooms elsewhere. The staff was pleasant, efficient and approachable.  They always were there to answer my questions on getting around the city and offered suggested paths.

On the positive side I will say that most of the staff is helpful and friendly and the location of the hotel is very good and the rooftop bar/restaurant is a wonderful way to end the night in Athens.   Having said that here are my concerns and issues with the hotel.  1. The bed is hard as a rock! The bed is literally a box spring and a mattress (old) with a thin sheet over it. I woke up every morning with a stiff neck and shoulder pain. Not good. When I did ask for another room I was told that all the beds are the same. This all could be avoided if they simply invested in egg crates at least you would have some give.   2. The Air conditioning is weak at best. My wife and I slept on top of the…\n",

Good breakfast if a bit limited, and the bed was a bit hard, but plenty of toiletries, spacious rooms, and excellent staff. very small lift but the porter does take your bags to the rooms for you.  The staff cannot do enough for you.  If you are looking to stay at a mid price comfortable and cosy hotel close to the centre and bustling shops and tavernas of Plaka.  Athens does not have a lot of money - loads of empty shops, stray cats, graffiti and homeless people - more than in London - but this is not reflected in this hotel.\n",

The staff was friendly and helpful.  The best part of the hotel is the roof-top deck; one side was the bar and the other was a place to relax.  We used it to play games and share a bottle of wine that we brought up.  Warning...the jacuzzi is not heated, so it might be good in the summer, but too cold in the off-season.

There is a local, urban Greek feeling to this neighbourhood with a market right out side the doorstep. Everything is walking distance in central Athens anyhow. The rooftop patio is wonderful, with unobstructed 360 degree views of the entire city. Our room was nice and clean, simple, not luxurious,  but stylish and modern - appropriate for the price range.

You are a 5 minute walk to Syntagma Square, a 10 minute walk to Monastiraki square, and 15 mins to the Acropolis. Come on -- you are in the centre of the action right in the Plaka. If you are not here, -- well you know how the rest of that goes.  The hotel is very well run, modern, with modern everything . The elevator is a hoot. Quite possibly the smallest thing that goes vertically which Shah has been in. Rooms are small enough to fit you horizontally but beyond that is a challenge. Avoid calisthenics. But you are in the premium location of one of the world's great cities, and space is what you must sacrifice.  The second reason that Shah liked this place was the breakfast.…\n",

The room size is very little, but it's understandable having in mind the location. The room was new, modern and very clean.  A down thing is that the bathroom/toilet has no real door - only a half glass, which is a bit confusing - every noise is heard in the room, and sometimes could be not so romantic :)  Also for a seven store hotel they had only one tiny lift and this was really inconvenient.\n",

If you like good service by very professional staff, then stay here. If you like value for money, then please stay here.\n",

      "Review is :Booked this hotel for a 3-night stay...and stayed for 9!! Beautifully-maintained, located in a quiet street but only minutes from Syntagma Square and Monastiraki Metro stations, the key visitor sites are within easy walking distance. Rooms are well-appointed and staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. Due to a medical emergency in my party on our final night we ended up needing to extend our stay. Reception staff responded immediately, called a doctor and helped with getting to hospital. Following surgery in the middle of the night the hotel ensured we could keep our room for as long as necessary and were always bright and cheery and available with information. So nice to feel supported and genuinely sympathetic. Would definitely return to this hotel-and the views of the…\n",

We soon forgot we were cross and tired and went up to the lovely roof terrace bar for pizza and drinks. Again the staff were welcoming and friendly and spoke to us in (perfect) English.   The buffet breakfast is served in a large light bright dining room, and again (yep) the staff were helpful, welcoming and friendly, even though we were there over the Greek Bank Holiday everyone was just super lovely and, if they minded being at work it certainly didn't show.

We enjoyed drinks after sunset on the rooftop bar which has an amazing view. I think the only downfall would be our standup shower in the bathroom seemed dirty and had a bit of mold. The bathroom in our friend's room was very clean though. Overall I think the service and friendliness of the staff overrides the cons. The front desk helped us arrange taxi service to the airport.

Staff is helpful in general. The rooftop bar is absolutely perfect offering stunning views of the Acropolis. Two gripes: The room we stayed in was on the sixth floor with a lateral (very very lateral...) view of the Acropolis. It was a very small room, with hardly any space to comfortably place a suitcase..not to mention two of them. Second is the noise. The hotel is adjacent to a school...the bell was ringing every 45 minutes as from 7:30.\n",

The staff are very accommodating and friendly on the whole, and we had no problems communicating as all the staff speak English at a reasonable level. Breakfast is fairly good, but lacks variety. One morning I saw that there was bacon, and was looking forward to having some the following day, but it wasn't on offer.

The room was comfortable, with en-suite shower room, and while not large was adequate for a couple spending most of the time admiring Athenian sites. The only downside was it was low down with minimal window area looking at surrounding buildings. To be expected with a bargain rate (~£50/night).

      "Review is :We stayed at the Central Hotel for 2 nights in September 2015.  We wanted to be close to the major sights since our time in Athens was limited, and this centrally-located hotel was a super convenient home base within easy walking distance from the Syntagma Square metro station (about 5-10 minutes).  Our double room was a little on the small side, but clean with modern furnishings, and the hotel’s staff were very pleasant.  The complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning offered a nice variety of items including Greek yogurt, fruit, cereal, meats, cheeses, vegetables, baked goods and beverages – perfect for getting up and hitting the ground running.  Plus the Central Hotel also has a rooftop bar and jacuzzi hot tub with a pretty killer view of Acropolis Hill.\n",

Breakfast was included and was satisfying with a decent selection. The highlight of this hotel ( apart from the courteous service and the cleanliness) was the wonderful roof top terrace with breathtaking views of the Acropolis. Just the place to take in the splendor of this ancient city. At night when the Acropolis is lit up the terrace view is magical. The Central Hotel is a beautiful place to stay.

The reason for this is that we had great views of the Acropolis on both our stays here, one night when we arrived and 3 nights when we left. A highlight of the hotel is the rooftop bar where you can take advantage of the wonderful view while music plays softly in the background.

Friendly reception, but very average rooms without darkening curtains and a very small bathroom.  For wifi one has to enter the code each time one logs in, which is annoying.

Great location to walk to food, shopping, the museum, and the train station. Great friendly and helpful staff.  Now the cons: I understand that hotel rooms in Europe are going to be small and the overall room size was ok but the bathroom was tiny. The sink was tiny, so small it is hard to brush your teeth, wash your hands and practically impossible to wash your face.   One of my only pet peeves is having the shower curtain touch you when you are trying to shower and this shower was so thin, maybe 24\" across that the curtain was always touching you as you are trying to shower in addition the drain was barely working so after say 5-7 minutes your standing in 2 inches of…\n",

There were no wash cloths but we brought our own. To get the AC to run your room card has to be inserted in a slot by the door which means that when you are out the AC is off. Room would be warm when we returned but cooled down fairly quickly. We had about 20 TV channels including the BBC so we were occasionally able to get news from the states.…\n",

      "Review is :Location, Location, Location. You will walk outside the hotel and you are in the middle of the action. You'll be a close walk to plenty of good day-time sightseeing. All the good sightseeing--ruins, beautiful architecture, ancient buildings, and museums. Beautiful big balcony. The hotel has a restaurant/bar on the rooftop with a nice view for a romantic dinner/drink. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. If you want Athens amazing night life, you'll need to take a approximately ten minute cab ride (less than 10 euro) to the beach area for the city's best clubs/bars. But there are a few smaller bars that are walking distance from the hotel if you don't want to get too crazy at the clubs by the beach. The only downside is that it's really really small. Good luck trying…\n",

Staff very courteous and helpful.   Missed not having tea and coffee in the room.  Well decorated place and very convenient location for the Plaka and central attractions.  We were in walking distance of the acropolis, other ancient sites, parliament building etc.   the little street the hotel is in is currently very run down but with quite a bit of work going on all around.

Although the rooms are a bit small (as is the 3-person elevator), we spent little time there other than to bathe and sleep.  I echo all the comments regarding the rooftop terrace--AMAZING in both the day and evening.  Being situated just on the edge of the Placa is a perfect spot for roaming the streets and taking in fine Greek cusisine.  As for booking transfers, take a cab.  Much simpler and usually a bit cheaper.  Would definitely stay there again.\n",

Situated on a narrow Plaka street, the Central is extremely convenient to Syntagma Square, the Acropolis and the many historical and archeological sites in the area. As also mentioned many times, the superior rooms on the top floor offer the best Acropolis views. The real star, however, was the rooftop lounge with absolutely amazing views of not only the \"Crown Jewel\" but of the Athens skyline and surroundings. Many sunsets observed during my five nights there and all of them beautiful. The staff, especially on the roof, were very accommodating and friendly, particularly Mary. A few things to be aware of: rooms were rather small…\n",

Pros: Helpful staff, great breakfast, great location  Cons: Hard to book a transfer, noisy in the evening, small room, and horrible air conditioner (the room was terribly hot)  Regarding booking a transfer into the city from the port or airport, they ask you to fill in a form with your credit card and fax or scan it back to send it back to them. Sometimes this is not ideal especially when you're already on the road. Also their transfer fees are slightly higher than just taking a taxi from the airport yourself.  The rooftop offers an amazing view of the acropolis and is worth a visit for drinks. I wish they…\n",

However, one reacted defensively when I asked if they could help us buy ferry tickets to one of the islands. That's not our business, he snapped. The room was admittedly cramped. There wasn't a lot of space for storing clothes. There was a safe for keeping valuables, but it was locked in the open position. A clerk was up within five minutes to set it straight. The bed was too soft for our taste. We're used to super-firm Thai mattresses. The bathroom was good, but I would have preferred a full-size tub.  Breakfast was a pleasant surprise.

I was initially given a room so small and cluttered with furniture (side tables, chairs) that I had to do some furniture moving before I could feel comfortable in the room. My second room was an improvement, but really this is a hotel where you want to go to sleep, and as long as you don't expect to lounge around in luxurious surroundings you'll be fine.

The hotel appears to be equally suitable as a business hotel or for a leisure stay.  The only real negative of the hotel (and luckily It did not at any time cause us a problem) is that the one and only lift is very small and caters for a…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the hotel for 1 night so my experience was limited.  The hotel is very close to major attractions in central Athens.  You are a few minutes (walk) to Syntagma square and the Plaka district.  We walked to all major sights from the hotel.  The hotel was very functional and clean.  The interior was updated and modern.  The rooms were also nice, however nothing special.  The ventilation in the bathroom was poor and the carpet was a bit dirty, otherwise everything else was great.  The breakfast buffet was very nice and for the price the hotel is a great value.\n",

I only used my room to sleep. The bed was comfy and rooms were nice. The rooftop bar was awesome it had a cool view of the Acropolis. The staff at the bar and hotel were very nice and helpful. I would stay here again on my next trip. Also if your in the mood for coffee or hot chocolate and pastries there's a small place called Chokolata which was awesome it's rite next to the dry cleaners on the same street the hotel is on. The lady there was really nice and spoke English.\n",

With a couple of tweaks, it could be even better: they need to invest in better mattresses and their wifi is unforgivably terrible.  However, the location is terrific, and the staff are all very pleasant and helpful.  My room had a beautiful view of the Acropolis, although on the downside it was pretty noisy on the Saturday night.  Great location - very close to shopping and tourist sites.\n",

From the rooms with view (we stayed 2 times in 2 different superior rooms) the view is not so good, but you see partialy the Parthenon and it is wonderful by night.

The room, although a 'superior' one was quite small but spotlessly clean - the room view was not very pleasant as it overlooked some fairly dilapidated buildings in the area and rooms with a view of the Acropolis are more expensive (we paid €600 for four nights). The breakfast buffet was quite good but not particularly varied - the hot food generally looked unappetising but the cold buffet was more than adequate.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooftop terrace was the crowning glory of the hotel with its magnificent view of the Acropolis and prices of drinks and snacks compared favourably with local bars and restaurants.\n",

When we asked at the reception to move us to a better room we inert given a lesson on how to behave. He added if you book on our site you get better room. So no discussion we had to accept that room.  The breakfast was ok. Very small lift made us take the stairs. It was more practical when staying at the second floor.

The staff were helpful as well and willing to answer our questions. There was also a safe in the room. The only thing was the toilet door, even though it was opaque there is a large gap between the bottom of the door and the floor which was a bit disconcerting.

Staff really friendly and helpful with lots of info on sights, directions and restaurants. In the same street as the hotel is a superb Japanese restaurant( do not remember the name but only one) and  Advocado Vegetarian restaurant around the corner served delicious food.

The staff is wonderful-very friendly and attentive.  The rooms are nice and clean, but could use a little TLC.  The beds are not the most comfortable:  the linens are ok, but the mattresses are hard and covered by a plastic protector, which was uncomfortable and hot.  The bathroom was clean, but it had an opaque glass door with no lock.  Not ideal if you are travelling with family.  Breakfast was good.  Not the best we have had in Europe, but adequate.  WiFi was free and signal strength was generally good in room and throughout.\n",

Our only complaint was the rudeness of the reception both at our check-in (when our reservation was cancelled due to an expired credit card, and they didn't call our mobile to try to find us) and at check-out (when I asked to see the detail of my bar bill before I paid for it).

The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom door: it was made of translucid glass (?) and it was short, like in a public bathroom, leaving a gap at the bottom, so you didn't have any privacy in there. There is also a translucid glass (like a window) in the wall between the bathroom and the room. Again, not much privacy inside of the bathroom. But everything was very nice and clean. The breakfast was very good, lots of stuff to choose from. I totally recommend.\n",

What a pleasant gesture and definitely leaves a very good impression for us.  The location is near syntagma square and acropolis. Near to all major attractions. You can also purchase the hop on hop off tour bus from the counter as well as enquire about day tour packages e.g. Cruise from the hotel reception.  Oh, you can also get to syntagma square via an express bus x95 and easily find your way to the hotel, about 5 minutes walk.\n",

The temperature is perfect! The same perfect and delicious is the breakfast! And don' t forgett that it is settled at the center of Athens!\n",

The rooms are clean and nicely equipped. Buffet breakfast with lots of choice. All very freshly cooked and delicious. A big plus for this hotel is the Top floor bar with a nice terrace with view to Acropolis.  Many good restaurants on the door step. Go for those with local food and where the locals go. They serve the best food.\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is in a good location. Just a few blocks off Syntagma square, which is in front of the Parliament. It is in a narrow street so not many cars drive there all the time, which makes it quiet. The rooms aren't particularly fancy and the bathroom definitely needed a bit of silicon stripping. I had an unforeseen event where the moment I checked in, my toilet wouldn't stop after flushing it and it flooded the entire room. Housekeeping decided to throw old sheets on the carpets and front desk wouldn't change me to another room as they were preparing for the marathon. The aircon temperature simply wouldn't change to anything cooler than what felt like 30'C. The next day when I returned after 1pm, my room was still not made. By then it was so stuffy from the wet carpets being…\n",

This was a great start and from start to finish the service in the hotel was great.

They did make some compromises building the hotel - whilst the bedroom is large, the bathroom is smaller than you'd expect, and there is only a small 2 person lift in the hotel - however otherwise I was very impressed by the hotel - it was far better than a 4 star hotel I stayed at in Athens.

We got a room with a view of the Acropolis and it was just amazing. Anytime you wanted, just open your curtains and there it was.

Rooms are small but it is the norm for the city, although the rooms are small they are just right for a couple and are clean, bed is comfortable, and its air-conditioned and we felt safe. Wonderful cafe/bar on the roof with stunning views of the Acropolis at night. I suppose a little pricey but we did not feel cheated at all. Breakfast was very…\n",

      "Review is :Great hotel in the Plaka. Hotel is on a weird street with lots of Orthodox religious supplies, but only a couple blocks away from the busy streets in the Plaka. We walked from here to the Acropolis Mueseum (about 25 minutes one-way). Rooms were small, which is to be expected in Athens, but nice. Wifi was reliable. The breakfast spread was very good. If you are on the back side of the hotel, the rooms face a schoolyard which is loud during the school day. Highly recommended. Booked through Fantasy Travel.\n",

But- 140 Euros is a lot of money for a small room. It was difficult to store our luggage as there is only space in the wardrobe for one smallish case. As mentioned by most reviewers the lift is tiny. One person and luggage and the lifts full. We were looking forward to using the hot tub/jacuzzi on the roof. This is not a hot tub. The temperature is cold. But worse is the disgusting state of the tub. There is green algae on the inside underwater and black mildew around the outside. If this was in the UK the health authorities would probably shut it down. We won't be staying again.\n",

We have always found the rooms to be spotless with great facilities and we have been lucky enough a couple of times to have a view of the Acropolis. That said we were put in room 101 on our last trip which was not to the usual standard of this hotel which was slightly disappointing. The roof terrace bar is out of this world and one of the key reasons we return to this hotel each year. All in all great hotel for short visits to Athens.\n",

Arriving on an early morning flight, trundling luggage for 5 blocks (albeit downhill) is not my idea of a vacation: so that was a huge disappointment--and it just wasn't for us, but for everyone: even the taxi's had to park on the sidewalk to get their clients off-loaded. What is the BIG sell of this hotel is the rooftop garden--which, now that it's OPEN to the public, we can drop in any time. The elevator is ridiculously small--only 2 with luggage at a time and when the rooms are on the 4th, 5th, or 6th floor, it's just not worth it to bring a group of more than 6 in. Breakfast is good, but it hasn't changed in all the years…\n",

Yes the rooms + bathrooms are, shall we say, compact, but this is the price you pay for the convenience of being in Plaka...and for the price. I just wish european hotels would understand the concept of a double bed - that it is NOT 2 singles shoved together with a horrible ridged gap in between.\n",

Its also got the most gorgeous view from the roof of the Acropolis which lights up at night - you can choose whether you have a drink and embrace the view or go for a roof top jacuzzi and do so. Both great options. We had an initial challenge with the air-conditioner but they sorted it straight away. The service was also generally very good though initially we had some sort of communication problem re printing out my voucher but it was also soon sorted.\n",

The Night receptionist greeted us with a smile, took our bags from us and showed us where we could get coffee/ water and some comfy sofa's to sit on - very welcome!  We decided to go for a walk to get our bearings and watch the city wake up.  As we left the Receptionist told us to check back at about 10 to see if there had been any early departures which meant we might be able to check in early - there had and we did!  Excellent!

It was close to the action but just enough away to get peace and quiet. The hotel has a beautiful rooftop where everyone goes to watch the sun set. The view of the Acropolis is right before your eyes!  The rooms are clean and simple. Breakfast was served on the main level every morning from 8am to 10am.  Overall, a great experience!\n",

I can understand how this hotel has been given good reviews because it does do some things very well - like the breakfast buffet, the helpful staff and it's location in the Plaka.  However, I have a hard time rating it better than average even with these pluses, because the towels were thin and shabby and the bed was so hard my husband could hardly sleep on it.  Bathrooms are so tiny it was hard to even really use them comfortably & my husband and I kept running into each other as there was only a narrow path around the bed.  We did have a balcony but never sat out there because the street on which this hotel is located is very rundown with vacant buildings.  I could not recommend this hotel…\n",

The room and hotel were clean and in good condition – I think the hotel is only a few years old. The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the middle of the Plaka district. This meant it was close to the shops/restaurants, had 2 metros station close by and most importantly was close to virtually all the historical sites – we only had to use public transport to get from the ferry terminal and to the airport, which on both occasions was easy.  The breakfast was a buffet style with lots of choice and was good quality and value for money. The roof top terrace is very nice offering a relaxing drink with great views of the Acropolis.

Also, the view from the upstairs bar was breathtaking. We had a view of the Acropolis from our hotel room also, which was a nice plus. The room was small, however that seems to be the thing in Greece.. I didn't have any issues with the bathrooms that I recall, I think they were fine size wise, again, comparable to Rome and the other hotels we stayed at in Greece. The only thing I didn't like was the really really really tiny elevator.. Like could fit 2 people and maybe a suitcase... Super small. Breakfast was nice, I LOVE the fresh OJ we had in Athens.. So refreshing. Mostly cold items on the breakfast but was good.\n",

Plaka in particular was a charming area.  However, the rooms were very small, even by European standards.  The bathroom was clean, nice, and neat, but so small that even washing your hands was hard, let alone washing your face - the sink was really not much larger than one on an airplane.  The shower was small too, if I were taller (or wider) it would have been uncomfortable. The A/C was also not on or working in April so the room felt stuffy.  I chose this place for the location and the Acropolis view. It was one of my dearest wishes to be able to open the window and gaze at the Acropolis/read/enjoy a drink, and so we…\n",

We were on the back side overlooking the dome of an old church, the back of the school and had a small view of the Acropolis as well.

Your first impression of the neighborhood might not be that great, as there is ample graffiti in the side streets. But that is the unfortunate reality of Athens--too many instances of ugly graffiti. It really drags the city down, as it is everywhere. But I have never felt unsafe in this neighborhood, even late at night. You are just around the corner from the main Greek Orthodox cathedral, which also contributes to the goodness of the neighborhood.

      "Review is :My husband & I stayed 3 nights at this hotel before going to the islands and again for 2 nights on returning. The staff is extremely helpful, friendly & professional. Each of our hotel rooms offered a beautiful view of the Acropolis, in room safe,& refrigerator. The rooftop restaurant has an awesome view of the Acropolis as well & is the perfect way to finish your day exploring the city. We ate at the restaurant on two occasions  having the pizza & club sandwich which were very tasty with fresh ingredients & reasonably priced. The hotel is located a 5 minute walk from Syntagma Square where the airport bus makes a stop as well as the hop on/hop off tour bus and many other excursions use as a meeting point. This end of the Plaka has seen better days with many empty store &…\n",

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The young girls who work at the rooftop bar are very sweet and attentive.  Very central location, which is obviously there selling point hence the name.  It is located on a quaint little street with the best restaurant we went to while in Athens very nearby.  There is a tiny, tiny elevator which reminded us more of Japan than Greece.  Overall, great stay and for the price and location cannot be beat.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at Central Hotel Athens for three days this past June.  It's location is perfect for walking around the Plaka area. It's also easy to walk to many of the sites, or close to public transportation if you need it.  The rooftop bar with it's view of the Acropolis is really nice, especially at night. It's great to have a drink and gaze at the view, but the restaurant only offers small pizzas and sandwiches, so it's not really a place for dinner. That's OK, because Athens has lots & lots of restaurants to choose from. The room was a little small, but the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice.A nice breakfast buffet was included in the price.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting in Athens for a short time.\n",

We had a comfortable, bright and modern (albeit slightly small) superior double room on the 4th floor with a good view of the Acropolis from our window. The staff was friendly and efficient.

The rooftop bar has an excellent outdoor view of the Acropolis and the city - fantastic place to go for a drink or snack at night.

I did not like the bathroom door, basically a glass panel that swings shut with around a 4 inch gap at the bottom, no privacy. The breakfast was very good and comprehensive.

It was impeccably clean, the complimentary breakfast was a perfect mix between European and American style with a lot to choose from and the staff was wonderful.  The rooftop view of the Acropolis is stunning and I definitely recommend relaxing up there one even at sunset.   Some rooms may face this view, mine did not.

      "Review is :This hotel is in a great location - minutes away from the syntagma and monastiraki metro stations, in the heart of the plaka neighborhood. There are lots of great little restaurants nearby, nice streets to walk on, and shopping (both flea market style and high end). The hotel room was small, but clean, bright and well equipped (mini fridge, toiletries, safe, closet, desk, t.v. etc.). The 24 hr reception was friendly and helpful. The rooftop bar is a stellar addition to your stay - the night time view of the acropolis should not be missed. The included breakfast buffet was great! - great variety, hot and continental options, and the options changed slightly from day to day. The only negative during our stay was the wifi connection in our room was very temperamental and most often…\n",

      "Review is :We loved our stay here. We took the metro from the airport and got off at Syntagma at around 9 pm. With the assistance of our GPS, we walked right to it and felt pretty safe doing so at that time of night. At check in they knew exactly who were and we were checked in about 2 minutes. The elevator is hilariously small, but given where we were, to be expected. We did manage to get 2 adults and 3 pieces of luggage in there. The view of the Acropolis from our room and the rooftop terrace and close proximity to awesome shopping (Ermou) and the Acropolis/Parthenon make this a win - win. The hotel is modern and quiet. No road noise or neighbor noise at night. Breakfast was adequate. I'd stay here again absolutely. Our \"double bed\" was two twins made into a king. Perfect. This was our…\n",

We stayed in a family room (two rooms connected together) and it proved to be a great hotel choice for our three nights in Athens.  The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring the sights in Athens by foot and close enough that we were able to stop back for a break from sight seeing mid day.    Although the elevator is very small as mentioned by many reviews, it was not an issue since we only used it for our luggage at the beginning and end of our stay, otherwise we took the stairs.  The rooms are fairly small, but the time we spent in the room was limited, only to sleep and get ready in the morning.

Athens is spotless and very safe and the Greek people are so nice. There isn't a pool but we were so busy site seeing we didn't really have time to waste lounging around a pool.

Only setback is that they do not have coffee/tea making facility nor stable internet connection. All that could be easily fixed by calling reception to assist.

Clean, updated rooms, tho on the tight side, are well-apportioned; attentive service, generous breakfast--- what are those ubiquitous wieners all about-- does ANYON eat them?

Add it's fortuitous placement within walking distance of most sites of interest and Athens is a piece of cake. Shortcomings, right rooms (not unlike most 3 star urban hotels-- the European standard) and a narrow, one- way street if you arrive in a big bus, you have to walk in with all your luggage.\n",

The yellow sheets appeared to be white again, however the bedding lacked a top sheet which meant that if you were hot during the night, you could only sleep with no doona/comforter or half in half out.

The  rooftop terrace has a view of the Acropolis day and night that is beyond fabulous.  The menu is minimal more in the realm of drinks and snack than meals, but there is an abundance of places of all price ranges to eat at within the immediate vicinity.   Front desk was helpful and everyone there spoke English.  Rooms were clean.  Wi-Fi is free but was inconsistent for both me and my wife.  Bad news when you are in the middle of  Skype call into a critical meeting and Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting.  For regular email and such it is up 90%+ of the time.  This would be 5 stars in terms of total experience for a very reasonable price compared to some of the fancier hotels close by,…\n",

      "Review is :My wife and I stayed one night at Central Hotel. It was a bit off the beaten path (kind of a nondescript side road in Plaka), but it was only a 5-minute walk from the Syngtama metro station, so not a bad location overall. The hotel was not overly ornate, and the room was rather cozy. The bed wasn't the softest either, but I still got a good night's sleep. If you stay here (or even if you don't), make sure you go to the rooftop terrace at night for a drink and enjoy the view of the Acropolis. That view can't be beat!\n",

I have stayed here four times now and cannot recommend it enough. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind enough to allocate an Acropolis view room when I brought my mother to Greece for the first time (her husband being Cypriot). The Central Hotel is a lovely example of Greek hospitality and proof that despite the economic troubles of recent times Greece is as always a wonderful tourist destination. The view of the Acropolis is breathtaking. Ζητώ το έθνος.\n",

Pros:  - very well located - free wifi in the rooms - very clean - very nice and helpful staff - nice view from my room and I didn't pay for it  Cons:  - no restaurant, only drinks and a few snacks available but VERY limited - poor breakfast, first morning croissants were hard as rocks and you could see black mold spots on the milk tube of the coffee machine...but coffee was good!

Lovely rooftop terrace with view on the Acropolis, but very high prices for a drink. Jacuzzi on the rooftop is just a big bath with cold water. This can not be called a jacuzzi!

There was the most amazing thunderstorm during our visit and we sat in the bar feeling warm and happy and watched the sky light up with the lightening around the Acropolis and it was fantastic.  The staff both on reception and at breakfast were friendly and welcoming and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel, it was fantastic value for money, the location is perfect for sightseeing and very central but not noisy.

The first room not only lacked internet, but the top comforter/sheet was stained with yellow splotches. (There seem to be multiple reviews with this complaint.) We asked to be moved to a second room because of these issues. Unfortunately, the second room also lacked an internet connection and the top comforter/sheet was stained yellow as well. The rug in the second room was stained. I had purchased slippers to walk in the room, so it wasn't terrible, but it was not pleasing to look at.   The shower in the room was nice and had good water pressure, but the door to the bathroom didn't extend all the way to the floor so that you could hear everything when…\n",

It was hard to fit the two of us and all our luggage in the room. The bathroom was very small also. However, the hotel is in an amazing location!! The view if the acropolis was un beatable and the rooftop bar was unbeatable. We spent two of three nights up there. The hotel was walking distance to all major sites in athens, again, great location.  Our only complaint other than the room being small was the bed was extremely hard and we weren't personally a fan of the breakfast...  Although they did have a capaccino machine (always good in my mind).\n",

The roof bar is open to 1am and offers terrific all round views of Athens with a spectacular panoramic view of the Acropolis and nearby  Lykibitos. Wide choice of food for breakfast which is a self service buffet. Lovely place for overnight stay or base for short break. Limited secure car parking underground by prior reservation is a must.

The rooftop garden has amazing views of the Acrópolis and the city. The rooms are small but they were clean. The bathroom sink is too small so you end up wetting the floor when you wash your face or brush your teeth. The elevator is very small it only accommodates 3 people. But overall the hotel is perfect due to its location, friendly staff, breakfast is included, and the rooftop garden is a plus for the great views!

I booked a room with the Acropolis view. The room is relatively very small in size and the bathroom is probably the smallest I've ever used. Room amenities are very limited. The premium paid for Acropolis view also wasn't worth it, as you would have to lean and stick your neck out to see the view on your far right. You would be better off booking one with the street view. Breakfast was good on the Mezzanine floor with variety.   Overall, a probably decent hotel for Athens standards.  PS: In Athens all attractions are centrally located around Athens, which you can walk if you can (30 minutes in between) or take metro or hop on bus…\n",

We are a family of three adults and reserved a triple room before and after our marvelous HAL cruise of Greece and Turkey.  We had room 509 for both nights and were very pleased with the spaciousness of the room (~325sf), especially by European standards.

Words cannot describe the sight. A tip to visitors is to check it out on a calm night and bring a camera.

      "Review is :This is a perfectly located hotel in the very heart of Athens. The view from the from rooms and the roof garden is magnificent. Staff is generally ok.  But this is where the positives end. The rooms are very small (with the front ones being smaller than the back street ones and without a balcony). The breakfast is very poor at the best and quality of ingredients very low. We didn't bother having breakfast the second morning and just had some in a nice caffe near the hotel. Hygiene of the breakfast area not great either (we asked for a highchair which had food residue allover). Our room was also a bit dusty (we were barefoot while dressing up and our feet quickly became greyish).

We had been travelling around the Greek islands and we had a lot of luggage. We did not know where to put the suitcases. There is hardly any space between the end of the bed and the wall and around the bed only one person could stand. The bathroom is the same. You need to hang outside the window to see the Acropolis. But the worst was that the room was next to the air conditioning pipe and there was a constant noise of the ventilator. I did not sleep the whole night, as it starts and stops constanlty, there was even a small vibration, problably from the window I don't know.

Central Hotel gave us just that - fantastic views from the bedroom as well as from the rooftop restaurant. The hotel is in the Plaka district and easily walkable to all historical sites and the shopping streets.   The breakfast spread was quite good and the whole deal was worth what we paid for! A few drawbacks - small bathrooms, only one small elevator and the airconditioning isnt very effective.  Everything else was superb. Will definitely stay here again.\n",

That is not to say it is a bad hotel. Apart from the marshmallow sized pillows and the nasty carpet (which should have been replaced 3 years ago - hell it should have been tile anyway in Athens) it was OK. And when I say OK, it was clean, the reception was immaculate, the shower worked and did not leak, and the view from the upstairs bar rivaled few places in Athens.  I just got this feeling though that more attention was paid to the entrance way than to the actual accommodations. Things just looked a little.... cheap.

The staff at the front desk was helpful and accommodating and the rooftop view is breathtaking (though it seems like many hotels in this area have a similar view).  Unfortunately, the room was incredibly small--like maybe a foot between the end of the bed and the wall to squeeze through.  The whole bathroom door thing is really a shame too.  There is a glass swinging bathroom door that does not extend to the ceiling or the floor, providing very little privacy.  With one person on the bed and one person in the bathroom it can feel like you are on top of each other.  I'm not sure what they were thinking when they designed that.

      "Review is :Very clean, very central, modern, it was easy to find and the view from the terrace is amazing! We had requested a king bed and they took that into consideration. The staff was great and the breakfast yummy! The only thing I'd like to point out is that the bathroom has a glass wall connecting to the bedroom and the door to the bathroom is also glass, hence, not much of a sound barrier... :)  The little rooftop terrace has a little Jacuzzi and a few sunbeds and the other one has several tables and chairs for relaxing and drinking. Overall, would definitely stay here again. Oh, one more thing... they have the smallest, tiniest, cutest elevator I've ever seen! If you have big luggage, it's one person at a time. :)\n",

      "Review is :We were travelling as a party of 3 and stayed in this hotel in June, 2013. It is very centrally located for all the main Athens sites, with small, clean rooms. Be aware that the standard triple room is very small, we could not open all three suitcases and dress at the same time, one person had to sit on the bed and wait for the others to finish. However, when we asked for a bigger room, it was provided and it was a good size, I am assuming that this was a superior one.  Beds are comfortable, and the rooms are reasonably quiet. Showers were hot with good water pressure. They offer a good basic breakfast.The decor is basic and scruffy in some areas, like hallways and entrances. The rooftop bar has a lovely view as mentioned by others, and is the hotels main asset. Staff are…\n",

Often I felt like a great inconvenience to them.  The rooms are small but clean and the beds comfortable. Showers are good and affixed to the upper part if the wall instead of the lower part as is often the case in Europe! That's a plus.  Breakfast is plentiful but average.  The location is good in terms of public transport and acropolis but it is incredibly busy and pokey (tiny streets, high volume traffic).  The view of the acropolis is great from the rooms and spectacular from the rooftop bar, both night and day. The rooftop bar is the highlight if the hotel with cold drinks and a jacuzzi.\n",

A room with a view of the acropolis would have been really nice but not available when we booked. Paid 100 euros for a standard double room for 3 guests where they brought a small extra bed in for our son . The larger triple rooms were sold out. We were out all day anyway so it worked just fine. I would stay there again if we retuned. It's not fancy but they cover the basics very well at a really good price\n",

There's no restaurant, but the bar provides light snacks until late, which was ideal for our late night arrival.

The hotel itself is nothing fancy.  We were in a partial Acropolis view and it was really quite a nice view.  But in the end, how much time do you honestly spend looking out a window in your hotel room?  The Acropolis view side of the hotel faces a school and it does get fairly noisy around 08:30, but when we didn’t have anything planned in the morning, we were able to sleep through it.

      "Review is :Central Athens Hotel is located very conveniently for tourists and so many attractions are a short walk away. Room we had had ample space, was clean, good storage space, had a safe, and a small balcony facing the street. So many restaurants, tavernas, bars and cafes nearby. Thai, Japanese, Chinese food places are just a few steps away. Noodle Bar 50 paces away is a great Asian food place. Absence of coffee/tea facilities in room were a let down, and I did not particularly like the toiletries provided. Bed was comfy and a/c operation was simple and efficient. TV channels almost all Greek, so that was a bit of a let down.. Wifi is free and available in rooms. A bit problematic though as connection was weak.  The Thea bar on the 7th floor gives an excellent view to the Acropolis…\n",

Modern rooms, wonderful staff and a fantastic location are all great attributes of this hotel.  The rooftop deck offers a magical view of the Acropolis and there is a small rooftop jacuzzi.  The basic rooms, however, are quite small for two people and feature a swinging bathroom door which affords somewhat limited privacy.  Opt for a better category of room.  Also, tripadvisor upgarde code was not honored.  Not huge deals, but a very pleasant stay nonetheless.\n",

Some have mentioned that the surrounding area is a little \"seedy\" at night, but that's because the stores all close down and lock up and there's a bit of graffiti. You're on the same street as a travel book store and several Geek Orthodox accoutrement stores (icons, vestments etc. - very pretty even just to window browse :)   Second, the staff was very helpful from helping me after I had mis-set up the safe, to storing our luggage…\n",

All the sites we wanted to see were within easy walking distance. Fun to get lost in the streets of Plaka! The rooftop terrace has amazing views of the Acropolis, nice place to sit and enjoy a drink and a bite to eat. Breakfast was included, with a great selection of food, especially enjoyed the fresh bread! Would reccommend this hotel and would stay here again.\n",

This hotel has amazing views of the Acropolis and all of Athens!  It is a short walk to Plaka, and pretty much anywhere you want to go!  The Central hotel is very clean, modern and the staff is very friendly as well!  They have a great breakfast, cute hotel rooms and the most modern bathrooms I have ever seen!  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone; groups or couples and I promise you will not be disappointed!\n",

      "Review is :Three friends and I stayed in this ideally located hotel in the heart of Athens. The rooms were small but comfortable and clean. Bathrooms were modern and clean. The only thing I wasn't sure about were the glass walls between the bedroom and the bathroom - you couldn't actually see through the frosted glass but it felt odd. I did not like the shower curtain. But the location makes up for these things. From the rooftop bar we could sit and gaze at the Acropolis for hours. It was firstly backlit by the sunset and then lit up at night. Almost close enough to touch it was a breathtaking sight. Breakfast catered to all tastes and included eggs and sausages, toast, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, juices, ham and cheese, chocolate croissants etc. Within walking distance of the Plaka District…\n",

We had a room at the rear of the hotel which also had a nice view of the Acropolis. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Great selection of hot and cold breakfast buffet. I've read various negative reviews regarding the size of the lift, yes, it is small but in no way did it affect our stay, don't be put off. Free wifi in room as well as pc's in the internet area.

I would recommend arriving for breakfast early though, unless you don't mind waiting, as the dining area is too small for the number of guests that may want breakfast at the same time. I must admit we were lucky in the fact that we had a room with an Acropolis view but as the roof terrace bar has a fantastic view of the Acropolis we would not have been too upset if our room did not have the view.

Breakfast and wifi included and both worked fine.  Hot tub on the roof deck was just warm enough to be refreshing, not cold, on a hot day.  I agree with the other reviews that the ac just about gets the job done; you have to leave your key in a slot to make the ac work so the room is always sweltering when you get back (unless you get a second key).  Rooftop garden cafe does a good job.  Beds were pretty hard but that seems pretty standard throughout Greece.\n",

We had a room facing the patio, not so nice but we haven't stayed in the room too much ...  Great rooftop restaurant with a magnificent view to the Acropolis.  In walking distance- great restaurants in Adrianou street- ask the reception, they are really nice and helpful.   As about the complains of the elevator-it is small, but it's really not a problem.

But if you are staying for a longer time, it might really get to you and make things quite difficult. Overall, if I was returning to Athens for a 1-2 nights, I would stay here again.\n",

A nightcap here is an absolute must. The staff are friendly enough, without going overboard.   One piece of advice - avoid the breakfast. The only item worthwhile is the yoghurt. The coffee is too hot (and therefore burnt). The scrambled eggs resembled a burnt cheesecake full of cinder. The hard-boiled eggs were cold and clearly made during previous days. The quality of the orange juice is best described as imagining water having passed through the urinary system of a horse.   Having said that, worth using as a base. Nice room, albeit small. Wonderful terrace. Excellent, central location. awful breakfast.\n",

All they could do was recommend a taxi (at 120 €), rather than actually checking bus schedules as we asked them to. We asked about going down to the Temple of Hephaestus -- we were told they close at 6 PM. We asked for a cab, which they called -- and the cabbie didn't even know where the Agora was.  When we got there, we discovered that it was all closed up -- since 3 PM.  Ok, so people make mistakes.  Got back, checked out the lovely view at the rooftop, went over to take some time in the jacuzzi -- the jacuzzi was off and cold. When I called, I was told, \"it's this kind of jacuzzi -- just the regular temperature, and no jets, but it's working, yes.\"  Ok - despite…\n",

The hotel has car parking underneath so for us it was very beneficial.. Staff and breakfast were also good. The lift was a bit of a joke, only 1 suitcase at a time!!!! There were 6 of us in a group and it took us ages to get our suitcases to our rooms. Thinking about the lift now still makes me laugh!!!  I would only stay here again because of the free car park it offers below...otherwise no. Very small rooms also, batrooms were a little hard to utilise.(squishy)\n",

It's a solid three star hotel as it is pretty new, clean, modern, pretty.  It's in a quiet, tucked away location but so close to the busy and fun areas.  Though a little far to walk to metros if you're carrying luggage (wheeling probably not bad).  Hotel is a bit small and tight but open so gives a larger feel.  From what I saw, it's not any smaller than what is common for 3 star hotels in Athens.  Concierge is friendly and helpful - checking in and out is fast and easy.

There were also lots of other selections: scrambled eggs, sausages, olives, yoghurt, etc. The hard-boiled eggs were weirdly cold so we soaked them in hot water before eating.  The location is good, very near to Plaka, though the alley just on the way to the hostel was quite dark and quiet at night.

The other reason was that we were only staying in Athens for two days and wanted to save money for indulging once we moved on to the islands from Athens.  Taking those points into consideration, I approached the hotel with an open mind (i.e., not comparing it to the resorts we would be staying at later on in our trip).   The lobby is nice - nothing too fancy, but pretty, gleaming marble.  After we checked in, we attempted to take our luggage up to our room.

It's in easy walking distance to all of the historical sites, you've got a great selection of shopping and restaurants almost at your door step and you've got 2 metro stations within 5 to 10 mins walk. The hotel itself is quite modern and very clean. Yes the bathroom is a bit small but still manageable. We also had a balcony overlooking the street which was nice to relax and get some air. As others have said, the rooftop gives you an amazing view of the Acropolis, well worth a look, particularly at night. There is a bar to be opened sometime soon on the roof top, but you can still go up there to sit, or to catch some rays on the sunbeds next to the jacuzzi. The staff at the…\n",

We took the train from the airport to Syntagma square and the walk from the station to the hotel is probably 5 minutes.  So close!  We walked all over Plaka, to the Acropolis, and to the Parliament building with no problems at all.  Breakfast consists of yogurt, fruit and a few pastries- just enough to hold you off until lunch.  The front desk even gave us the name of this great restaurant that gave us a complitmentary bottle of wine to take with us!  I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a nice, clean hotel that is pretty cheap with a nice rooftop bar area.\n",

It's main attractions are it's location in the Plaka district 5 minutes from all the shops, restaurants and bars and within walking distance of most tourist attractions. The price is reasonable but certainly not backpacker-cheap. It also has a great rooftop bar with jacuzzi with amazing views of the Acropolis, especially at night when it's all lit up and best enjoyed with a room-service beer in hand!

The whole place wreaked of smoke.  The staff didn't seem terribly knowledgeable; we found the reception at other locations much better.

It is also in a safe neighborhood. Breakfast was good. It was a good workout to walk from the hotel to the Acropolis. Acropolis is under renovation now so there was not much to see and it may take up to two years to complete. Try to book the room before you leave home.We were not sure if we would stay in Athens because of the strikes/ protests in the news. We booked the room at the airport thru the third party at 120 Euros-- a complete rip-off. The cab driver overcharged us 5 Euro-must be 40 Euro only from airport to Athens, according to the receptionist.\n",

The A/C worked great - no complaints. A small sink is inconsequential when you look at the rest of the hotel. I would highly recommend. We left early, so I don't know about the breakfast, but the location was very good to all the happenings and restaurants.\n",

The price is affordable, yet it is in a great location (near Syntagma, in Plaka), offers a great view of the acropolis from the rooftop, and the rooftop bar also has a nice bar (the bartender was really friendly).  The room was on the small side, but that is not surprising if you have traveled to other European cities.  The breakfast was included in our rate, and was delicious.  We loaded up on Greek yogurt everyday.\n",

      "Review is :We choose the Central Hotel because it is located roughly midway between the commercial centre of the new town and the tourist areas of the old town. That means about 15mins walk will take you to most of the ancient sites. It's on a sidestreet that seems, at first glance, a little grubby; but the same can be said of much of central Athens and it is close enough to a main drag that you'll feel safe at night. The public areas are very nicely furbished and the bedrooms, while quite small, are perfectly comfortable. I doubt that it's worth paying extra for a view because it's mostly quite built in. The real highlight is the roof terrace which has a spectacular panorama over the city including the acropolis, which looks fantastic when lit up at night. It's the perfect way to end an…\n",

While the room was small, it was very efficient -- some very smart designers figured out how to get so much in so little space without feeling cramped.  And, it was very clean.  But, the real gem here is the rooftop bar.  The Acropolis looks so close you could touch it.  We started or ended every evening there as it was so pleasant and captivating.  Breakfast was also plentiful and everyone we met working from front desk to rooftop bartenders were friendly.  I'll go back here when I go back to Athens.\n",

PERFECT!!! From Syntagma Square, we walked to the hotel with all  our luggage. (Not the easiest thing due to the stone paved sidewalks, but we got there!!) The staff weren't too friendly or helpful as they could see us struggling with our bags and didn't once offer to help. Check in was okay, but once again, the staff member was not very welcoming or warm. Perhaps staff need a bit more work on that aspect. Anyway, that didn't really bother us…\n",

Wifi:  aweful, come on, it's 2011, no wifi?  We had friends in a much lesser hotel and they had nice, strong wifi.  This is a real 2011 shame.  You can walk to the McDonald's a few blocks away though to stay connected or organize your travel options for the day.  Breakfast:  Nice.

Do not stay at the Hermes hotel next door as it is the same price, the rooms aren't as nice and it has no view of the Acropolis cause the Central Hotel blocks it.

The rooms were nicely furnished, clean, safe and the size was typical of a European hotel room.  The breakfast spread was large and tasty and the rooftop terrace (with views of the Acropolis) was great.  The best part about this place is the location.  2 minutes from the heart of Plaka and 2 minutes from Syntagma square, you really can't ask for much more in Athens.    The value for this hotel in Athens is fantastic.  It's not going to change your life but you could easily pay 2X the amount and get a hotel of similar quality.  You won't find many more places in Athens that is so convenient and comfortable for the money.\n",

Cons: 1) location: though near to all tourist sites, the hotel is situated 2-3 lanes inside the main road…\n",

Staff very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions.  Breakfast was great, with an extensive selection foods to suit all tastes (cereals, fruits, toast, eggs etc) and kept us going until lunch.

It's not smack dab by the Acropolis but it's a great walk and there is tons to see on the way too.

It is in the Plaka district, about three blocks from Syntagma square, and close to the Acropolis (Parthenon) and Agora. 3) It has a fine roof-top terrace with a terrific view of the Parthenon. 4) Rooms are reasonably priced.  If you travel to Athens to enjoy the hotel, go somewhere else.  If you travel to Athens to enjoy Athens, this hotel is a great choice.  The rooms are basic and the service perfunctory, but I will probably stay here whenever I'm in Athens.\n",

The rooms were clean and everything worked so no complaints there, and overall the hotel looks and feels very much like a smart and clean business hotel.

I stayed by myself, but it was a room that could easily accommodate 3 people. Just the bathroom is very, very small. Breakfast was good and included. Quite easy to reach from Syntagma -  I took the subway from the airport, the ride was 45-min (maybe because it was Saturday). The people at the reception were very nice and fluent in English.

But the next day the weather was quite lovely and would have been nice to use. The room was very small. There was no place to unpack or even put our suitcases. And we had a superior room. The bathroom was small too. The frosted glass (as many mention) didn't bother us, but the fact that the shower curtain kept blowing into the shower made it even seem even smaller.

Small room (comfortable twin beds) and the much mentioned issue of the frosted glass panels in the bathroom, which gave no privacy at all, but both areas were clean. The walk in shower was a positive, not the climb into the bath to use the shower, which is perilous for anyone at any age.

After laying down our 2 luggage on the floor, you cannot find some space....the bathroom is tiny too...even for me, who is from Hong Kong, while we all live in matchbox-like flat.....…\n",

Now, this is not a resort type hotel, mind you, but it definitely felt like it!  True, there are no casinos, lazy rivers, shopping, etc at the hotel, but the rooms were VERY nice.  The bathrooms was amazingly spacious & top notch. Beds were extremely comfortable and you would never know you were staying in the bustling city of Athens!  It was so quiet!  Walking distance from the major attractions in the city including, Hadrian's library, Tower of the Winds, Acropolis, Sintagma Square, and great dining in Plaka, this place is a hidden gem.\n",

The service is great, very professional and courteous. We asked for recommendations for places to eat and they gave us several great places. Try Ydria near the Acropolis!  The best feature about this hotel though, is the rooftop deck and jacuzzi with an uninterrupted view of the Acropolis! We went up one night with a bottle of vino and admired the view from above. We really liked this hotel, although it sort of lacked the Greek charm that we found in the other hotels on the islands. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a place to relax and to enjoy the view - this is the place to be.\n",

The sunset over the Acropolis was stunning. The rooftop garden was perfect - you bring your own bottle of wine and sit and relax. They have a Jacuzzi on the deck to relax in.

Being taller people, we both appreciated the spacious bed and the nicely sized shower.  The room was extremely clean and modernly appointed.  We also appreciated the in-room fridge to store our beer and wine.  The rooftop deck is something that puts this hotel over the top.  Nothing can beat gazing at the Acropolis through all the different stages of a sunset with a cold beer/glass of wine in your hand.  Also, breakfast was available each morning and was included in the cost of the hotel.  The breakfast wasn't anything fancy, but suited our needs perfectly.

There was no view from our room window, but the rooftop has a large space for sitting with wonderful views of the acropolis and athens.

The hotel is attractive, clean, and situated right in Plaka, which is a fun, more tourist-driven area of cobblestone streets and shops that stay open late.  It has the smallest, slowest, most claustrophobic elevator I've ever used, but it also has a roof deck that has an unparalleled view of the Acropolis, where you can sip a glass of wine and marvel at where you are.  The rooms are small but very clean and well-appointed, though the cable TV is horrendous - the only English speaking channel is BBC, and in some rooms it's just static.

Nice breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs and sausages as well as breads, yogurt, etc., and an automated espresso machine that made surprisingly good coffee.  One of our favorite features of this hotel was the amazing view of the Acropolis from the rooftop (you can bring up your own food and drinks).  They were renovating the jacuzzi area, so we didn't get to try that out.  Internet access was available at a reasonable price.  Overall good location and good value.\n",

Bathroom was clean; however, the sink was tiny and there is no counter space (minor).  Rooftop pool/deck is very nice with views of the Acropolis (lit up at night).   Location is excellent, quick walk to pedestrian areas in Plaka including street markets and restaurants.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at the Central for night when we first arrived in Greece and one night at the end of our trip.  As others on this page have said, the location was perfect.  Great side street, almost equal distance from Syntagma Square metro and bus stop and Monstraki metro.  On the first visit we stayed in a superior room.  I can't tell you how amazing it was to wake up in the middle of the night, groggy from jet-lag, and look out the window to see the Acropolis glowing above.  It seemed like a dream.  This moment alone made me very happy that we found the Central.  Oh, and there's a great, teany-tiny cafe perfect for an end of the evening ouzo located on the small street right in front of the hotel.\n",

      "Review is :We chose the Central Hotel primarily for its location, and were not disappointed on that front.  It is unlikely that you will find a better value in Plaka -- with online booking and a weekend special, we paid 89 euro per night.  For a view of the Acropolis, you must book a \"superior\" room, which we did not opt for.  The room was small, rather non-descript, with tired wall-to-wall carpeting.  The furniture was almost Ikea-bland, but at least we had two chairs and a small table.  In our \"regular\" (double occupancy) room, there were two twin beds pushed together, each with its own set of sheets.  The bathroom was surprisingly modern, with swinging frosted glass door (which did not go all the way to the floor, so don't expect privacy on that front.)  The caulking around the shower…\n",

After staying there I realized that we had the best spot in the city!  It has the perfect location that it close to both Monastiraki, Syntagma Square, many other shopping areas & 2 metro stops.  The included breakfast is a nice plus!  You recieve a lot of food & it's easy to leave there stuffed!  One downside was that smoking is permitted during breakfast.  Some may like this, however as a non-smoker, I found it hard to enjoy my food with someone next to me smoking.  You can certainly move to another spot in the restaurant, however if it's crowded then you may not have many other options.    Speaking of…\n",

The pro's: Location is excellent - easy walking distance throughout the plaka - even walked home from the Acropolis;  Breakfast buffet is very nice; View on the roof of the surrounding city and the Acropolis is amazing - at day and at night.  Also, found guests on the rooftop deck to be friendly (fellow Canadian, Americans and Aussies);  The rooms were small, but clean, as was the bathroom;    The cons: The roof-top bar is not really a bar at all.

Although the hotel was renovated for the 2004 games, the building has not been maintained.  The carpets are stained and the walls are beat up.  The real concern is the LACK OF CLEANLINESS.  There was hair all over the bathroom, the carpets were not vacummed, and there was what appeared to be a blood stain on the bed sheet.  Oh, I forget to mention the mold problem in the bathroom.

I booked on their website and got a deal for about 100 Euro a night with breakfast. I found that in Athens everything was booked everywhere and I was worried we'd have to stay in a dirty, scary hotel in a bad part of town or pay exorbitant prices when I tried to make reservations a good 2 months before our trip. I was relieved to finally book the Central without having to pay more per night than I really wanted to. I was more relieved when we got there and it was quite nice with a nice staff and good breakfast to start the day.

      "Review is :We recently spent two nights at the Central Hotel in Athens - the location was good (near Syntagma Square), it has a great rooftop deck with an amazing view of the Acropolis at night and the bathrooms are updated.  However, our room was very bare and smelled like smoke, even though we were on a non-smoking floor/room.  The smell is literally in the shower curtain and walls.    It was a little overpriced for what we got, but I think that is just Athens in general.  The breakfast in the morning was okay - nothing too great.  Admittedly though, we had just come from the Heliotopos HOtel in Santorini which offered fantastic breakfasts.  The staff was civil, but not willing to help with anything really.  When we asked how we could get the metro schedule, the guy at the front desk…\n",

He checked us in, told us where to go in search of something to eat and even lent us an umbrella as it had just started to rain.  Room was compact, but having read the reviews on here, I wasn't expecting anything huge.  That said it was very clean and had everything we needed in it.  Only made it to breakfast once, and it was usual continental fayre.  We did venture up to the roof terrace, and had the weather been nicer, no doubt would have tried the hot tub!

The room and is very small, but had a view of the Acropolis and the roof garden was great.   On the down side, the walls were paper thin, we could literally hear an entire conversation being held in the next room. The beds, as we have found at many other Greek hotels, were two doubles pushed together rather than a queen or king and were pretty uncomfortable.  As other reviewers have mentioned the lack of privacy in the bathroom due to the frosted glass \"door\" and wall were problematic.  Would we stay at here again? Probably not--no huge problems, but not exactly comfortable.\n",

We booked using their online reservation system.  I tried emailing them several times to ask for a non-smoking room with a view of the Acropolis.  I never got a reply.  However, when we checked in, we did get the room we had requested.  The location is in Athens’ oldest neighbourhood, Plaka.  It is walking distance to the Acropolis, many of the other ancient sites, shopping, restaurants and the Syntagma metro station.  Dealing with a rental car, waiting for taxis, or figuring out public transportation are hassles probably best avoided in Athens.  The hotel has some stylish elements, such as a curved marble stairway. …\n",

Getting to and from the airport or Pireas port could not be easier...and great if you want to venture to different areas when being on foot becomes to much!!!

The mattress was like rock - I can understand that the troglodytes were angry if they had to sleep on slabs of rock like these. The other problem was the carpetting.

Normally, I'm very picky about the hotels I choose, as everyone should be with the prices they charge!  I was in Athens for only a 3 day weekend and location was the most important factor in booking my hotel.  Had I been staying there longer I'd not have been as satisfied with this property.  The location is great, as many have mentioned, very near a subway stop, walking distance to many of the tourist attractions, and just a hop and a skip to the shopping and dining in the Plaka.   The room was small, but nicely furnished (except for the carpet, it was like sandpaper!) even with the glass walls and door to the bathroom.  They are frosted glass and…\n",

      "Review is :We ended up staying at the Central Hotel after the Magna Grecia failed to honor our reservation, and shunted us over to the Central.  The location is very convenient to Plaka and Syntagma.  The staff was pleasant and the lobby large.  However, the hallways were like an oven (apparently from the boiler), smelled, and weren't very clean.  Likewise the mat on the floor of the room wasn't clean.  Paying over 100 Euros to stay in this hotel is not a good value.  There are lots of better places to stay in Athens.\n",

It was very cheap  and the room was big enough for my wife and I and our 3 year old. The breakfast was good and the staff at the desk were friendly and helpful.  Some reviews mentioned the bathroom layout. Our room had a shower only when, after the marathon, I wanted a bath! Also the doors could be more private but these are small quibles for what is a lovely hotel and didn't detract from a wonderful 4 days and doesn't lead me to reduce my rating.  ps for a great, simple meal go around the corner into Voulis and walk up the hill to the next crossroad. No frills but good food.\n",

The room itself was tidy -- but very small.  Not sure if this is standard for all rooms, but we had a partial view of the Acropolis which is also walking distance from the hotel.  I would defintiely recommend this hotel in Plaka.  There are lots of places to eat nearby and travel agents if you want to get away.\n",

The hotel is perfectly located, just a few minutes walk from 2 different train stations, the Acropolis and a number of other intersting tourist attractions.  The bathroom and linens were clean and everything in the room was in working order.  We paid 143 Euro (including 20 or so Euro extra for an Acropolis view, which I wouldn't do again because as there is no balcony, you have to just stand at your window). The breakfast was good, with a number of different choices and good coffee. We tried to stay another night on our trip, but they were fully booked.\n",

Great location - easy walking to the Acropolis and other major ruin sites!  On the roof-top deck, complete with hot tub, it also boasts a great view of the Acropolis, as well as one of the most romantic sunset views one could want.  All of that is great once you get checked in, and learn the idiosycrisies of your room.  The lobby is attractive enough - open to a landing above where meeting rooms and the continental breakfast is served (average muffins and breads, but good coffee).  Arriving earlier than the late afternoon check-in, the reception crew rather reluctantly let us leave our baggage in the lobby while we went off to explore for a few hours.  Upon our…\n",

The room was quiet, clean, modern and comfortable, with a real queen bed and excellent shower.  The sink was one of the tiniest I've seen, but that wasn't a big deal.  Although the view out the window wasn't notable, the rooftop terrace had a fantastic view of the Acropolis and the surrounding area.  At sunset, everyone came up to enjoy the spotlights being turned on to the Parthenon.  The only problem was that the street was not well lit enough.  Make sure to ask the desk for the most direct route to the Pedestrian area, as the side streets are all too dark.  Athens has come a long way!! I've been twice before,…\n",

Before booking I contacted the hotel via e-mail and they answered immediately. But after booking I have been trying to contact them again for some matters regarding my reservation (at least 6 times), via e-mail and through their web page and I have not gotten a reply yet.        So, if you want a hotel which will be easy to communicate with, this is not for you, but if you don't mind having to call direclty and spend A LOT of money on phone calls, then go ahead.\n",

Therre was a very large black stain around the refrigerrator and the carpet itself was not clean.  The room was for three people, the third bed was very uncomfortable and consisted of a fold out cot type bed with very flimsy slats that did not support the body of a 15 year old boy who is average weight and height. The people running the hotel were friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was good. Perhaps we just had a bad room.

It's well situated in the Plaka near several nice eateries and also very close to the main shopping street.  My husband and I were travelling with our kids, ages 5 and 10.  We stayed in a \"family suite\" that had two seperate bedrooms with attached baths with a connecting passage.  It was great to have two bathrooms as well as privacy and a little extra space.  It was good value for money too.    I do agree with a previous reviewer that the bathroom with the frosted glass window would probably not be comfortable for people who were travelling together but did not know each other very well.

Rooms are small, but clean and the view from the roof garden is gorgeous. Staff at the reception desk is kind and helpful, as well as the staff at the buffet breakfast. We were allowed to keep one room until 2 pm and were also helped in finding a pharmacy on Saturday (almost all pharmacies are closed on Saturdays and the ones which should be open, are closed as well...). In order to find good prices, I would recommend contacting the hotel directly by e-mail. Have a nice stay in Athens!\n",

As the Central, it still has all of these things.  It was re-done a few years ago, with a great decor.  However, we found one major problem, which was that the high-concept decor, which looks great, has the bathroom wall in etched glass, with some clear areas, making the bathroom not all that private.  In addition, the glass door to the bathroom does not reach the top or bottom of the door frame, so there is little privacy from that standpoint, either. If this kind of thing would not bother…\n",

The rooms were clean, even if the carpet was a bit stained and worn, and the size adequate. Many rooms have a private balcony. Breakfast was nothing special but good enough. The best part of the hotel was the roof terrace with a fantastic view of the Acropolis. Although there was a bar up there it was never staffed.

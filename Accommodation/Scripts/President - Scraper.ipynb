When we checked in the lady in the reception was super formal almost unfriendly - not as friendly as you usually get at other hotels - other staff was more friendly but not all. The lobby is nice and the top floor has a super nice view of the city. The layout Is also very nice but it was so slow service - I had to wait for 10 min to get my beer and the place was filled to 15-20%. Our room was from the 70ths and it smelled old smoke even if it was a nonsmoking room. Some of the floors have been renovated but not all - and not my floor. The elevator is also old. Too few and too small elevators. I stayed on the 12th floor but it was easier and quicker to take the stairs down to the breakfast. On one of the elevators, you needed to push(!) the door open otherwise it wouldn't open.…\n",

      "Review is :Nice hotel. Aging from the outside but walk inside and the lobby and restaurants and bars all look great. I believe they have had a recent renovation. I got a superior room based on other reviews I read. I originally had a Classic Single but many described these rooms as being dated, aircon dusty and noisey, stains on carpet etc. I guess these rooms in time will also be renovated. Because I knew I would be spending a fair amount of time in my hotel room I promptly contacted the hotel and asked for a renovated room. These they call ‘Superior’ rooms and cost me €18 more a night. I could have risked an unrenovated room but glad I didn’t simply because this way, my very jet lagged self knew I could go straight to a modern room. The AC was very quiet and needed cause the windows don’t open. The bed was comfy. The bathroom small but ok. The sink had next to no spot to put a toothbrush etc. The basin itself was unnecessarily big. A bit more room for the odd toiletry would have been good. No shelf or spot for things in the shower. But just niggling things. The lifts are small and dark! But fine if you don’t mind small spaces. Breakfast I got included and was good. Rooftop bar and pool area was lovely. Didn’t go swimming but sat by the pool and in the bar area itself. Had a couple of things off the menu and they were fine. Views pretty good of the surrounding surburban areas and hills. Handy bakery across the road, Starbucks, KFC, TGI Fridays a short walk away as is a two level supermarket. About 3.5kms from the major Athens sites.…\n",

      "Review is :Lovely hotel with an amazing 360 degree panoramic roof top views of the city. The top floor roof top is with chilled vibes low key music with a really nice artistic interior design. The pool is not huge but quite to relax and take in the striking views and especially in the evening the sunsets. The roof top bar offers food and drinks with a couple of refreshing cocktails. You can walk all the way around the top floor to see the views all around. Really lovely touch amongst the busyness of Athens. The hotel has many floors which we liked as chose to stay high up as we found the roads can be very noisy at night. The rooms are spacious and very clean with nice walk in showers, The rooms do not have balcony's just big windows so can still see nice views. The rooms was quiet did not hear much noise from other guests. We stayed   just after the first Covid, during Covid as well as in Greece for medical reasons.  We found the hotel a great location for sight seeing around Athens. Taxis was parked outside the hotel and only took 5 mins to go into the centre. Athens is full of grafity but this creates an artistic look, wrapped in with the historic ruins and modern shops. We found taxis at the trooping of the guards area more friendly and slightly cheaoer than further in. This leaves a nice little walk through the town and into cobbled streets leading to historic ruins. Check out the cats at the historic ruins in the main centre as these colonies are looked after by many locals and nine lives of Greece. Opposite the hotel is a Patesserie with yummy cakes & pastery's. Turn left out of hotel and left again a few turnings down, follow the little roads up hill and you come to a little square (5mins walk) with a selection of eateries and a coupke of bars. The hotel staff are very professional and friendly.…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed in this hotel from July 6 to 10th, 2022  CONS:  - UNPROFESSIONAL/DECEITFUL? STAFF at the FRONT DESK.   The front desk person called Nikkos, charged us twice under the claim that our reservation was not registered in the system. He blamed Agoda for being a \"very weird\" platform. We insisted him to double check but Nikkos rushed the whole thing out, did not dedicate time enough to double check the reservations system. He said it was either making a new reservation or leaving. Then he asked us to move away to attend another guest who was queuing behind us. We had to pay for a new reservation on the spot as it was 12.30 midnight and we had no place to go. Once we made the payment Nikkos jerked the invoice to us. Fortunately next day my bank alerted us of a suspicious movement in my account and found out that the hotel had charged us twice same amount. The hotel refunded us the money only the last day of our stay. The person who charged us twice, Nikkos, did not apologize at all and kept his rude attitude until the end of our stay. He was also rude and unhelpful towards a middle - age man who was attended after us and who needed advice on taxi transportation.   - UNCLEAR CHECK OUT TIME:  Check out time was at 11 am however, the front desk Nikkos provided us with an invoice in which reads check out was at 12.00.   - WORN OUT ROOM:  We stayed in two different rooms 1207 and 1204. Carpets worn out and stained, yellowed stain on the wall in 1204, bath towels also worn out with holes in 1207, outdated hair dryers, vanity boxes empty (?) in both rooms, safe box did not work in 1204.   - FACILITIES? :  you have to pay up-front 8 euros to use the gym for 45 minutes. Swimming pool is free but you can not enjoy it after a day visiting Athens as it is closed at 6pm. It opens at 10 am and you need to get a deck-chair right away as it gets easily crowded and you need to wait long by the bar for someone to leave.  - MEDIOCRE BREAKFAST:   We missed healthier options. Besides, almost no vegan/vegetarian options.   - RANDOM WIFI: did not wok in the breakfast restaurant.   PROS:  - PROFESSIONAL FEMALE STAFF AND BELL BOY. Particularly the lady who helped us to fix the issue with our reservation. Once we explained to her the problem, she was able to find our reservation in no time despite her colleague Nikkos claimed it was not in the system. She mediated between us and the hotel management. We are very greatful to her. We felt the whole thing quite stressful and her professionaliy made us feel safer. I regret not asking for her name. She is a tall young woman, brunette hair with blonde highlights.   The bell boy who works at night shift at the hotel welcomed us as a professional front desk would do. He was also helpful explaining us breakfast time and how to find facilities and how to connect to wifi.…\n",

All of the staff we saw were very friendly and helpful. We had a fantastic newly renovated room on the 17th floor with a view of Athens.  We had breakfast each morning in the hotel and it was a buffet style with plenty of choice.  We had dinner on two evenings in the hotel and the food was delicious would highly recommend it.

The actual hotel and lobby itself is pleasant enough, but the rooms are incredibly dated and feel like they haven't been modified in decades. Having a room on the first floor facing the main road is akin to trying to sleep in the pit lane at a Formula 1 meeting, as unfortunately the windows offer no sound proofing against the loud traffic noises outside.  The bathroom is very dated and is poorly lit, and the water overflows onto the main bathroom floor.

      "Review is :Really disappointing experience.  Shabby rooms and corridors, old furniture, everything sorely in need of refurbishment.  It was clean and neat however so not all bad, but I expected much more from a 4 star hotel.  The hotel's location on a busy, noisy and equally shabby street  appears to have no good restaurants within easy walking distance and with the hotel restaurant closed on a Monday, one is left to contemplate the plain unadorned yellowish bedroom walls, or stare out at the air conditioning units or washing of the apartment block across the alley.   The President certainly doesn't seem to live up to a 4 star listing and so far is one of the least enjoyable hotels I have ever stayed in.\n",

To start, you can only eat at the restaurant or get room service from the restaurant. You cannot have food delivered nor can you bring food from the groceries inside the hotel. They claim this is a concern because of covid. Apparently, the croissant from the bakery across the street is infected with covid and could risk the entire hotel... Obviously, this is a way for the hotel to make money off of their restaurant, which charges really high prices for for food that is low in quality.

Furthermore the personnel is not enough to give a good service in a 19 floors building. The second night when I came back in the room I didn’t find any water inside the mini bar.  I called both the concierge and the room services without any answer. I tried 15 min later with no success again.  Since I already put on my pigiama I had some tap water and I went to bed.

      "Review is :I had 2 short stays here on the beginning and end of a vacation package and was satisfied with the hotel in general.   The property is really nice with a generous breakfast buffet and relaxing roof-top bar and pool area to relax at the end of the day. My only complaint with the bar is the limited options of wine by the glass (three) which would have not been a problem had I liked the one white wine offered. But this did not deter me from enjoying this beautiful space each night!  This hotel is located on a very busy road about a 45 minute walk from the main downtown area. I am completely aware of traveling in urban areas and expect some street noise. The traffic noise on my first part of my stay was incredible and the air handler (on turbo) was so soft it really didn’t block out…\n",

Staff was friendly and helped getting taxi's and directions.  Taxi fares were very reasonable to the major spots of the city.  Plaka, Acropolis, etc.    Walking to nice cheap eats and the bakery across the street is a must!  Roof top bar was a very nice relaxing place to end our day.   Don't think small children should be allowed.   Sorry, just saying, its a grown-up bar   Stores near by as well as coffee shops.  I would stay again!\n",

Hence there was a long wait.  It seemed like a poor decision to have a bar man doing nothing while one woman tried to book in 20 hot grumpy travellers at once.   The pool is a party pool ie for sunbathing, cocktail drinking and when we visited , twerking.   It Is not a very family space and we felt slightly out of place.    Location is good. Metro convenient. Rooms alright - dated but it isn’t a resort hotel where you want to hang out in the room anyway.  Breakfast delicious.  Guys who mange the bags are great - friendly, welcoming, helpful.\n",

Views are stunning & staff are great. HOWEVER, it is ridiculously overpriced & the food is tasteless. The next day we decided to use the rooftop pool, firstly there are barely any beds/no room. Secondly, we were told we could not enter the pool area with our (1 each already open) cans of coke, as you cannot bring your own food or drink to the pool - you HAVE to purchase from their bar (at the extortionate prices). When we later wanted to pay the bill, charging to the room requires an advanced topup down at reception......!!!!!

This is a plus, but it would be perfect if the distance was a little closer. And that is the only negative comment I can think of. Everything else was amazing. The rooms where clean and nice equipped with a very comfortable bed and with all those little things that make your stay easier, like toothbrush, slippers etc. The price was very reasonable. My room was at the 17th floor, so the view of Athens was amazing. The free WiFi was great when i used it and the personnel was very kind and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.\n",

This hotel is just outside the ‘taxi circle’ so not right within a short walk to anywhere. It’s about a 10-15 walk to the subway which was fine for us.

The breakfast whilst crowded was amazing as it featured a mix of continental & local Greek cuisine.   We opted for a late check-out which allowed us the opportunity to check out the rooftop pool which boasts an incredible 360 degree view of Athens; I believe some people come upstairs to this hotel and pay for the view; we were lucky to capture it for free.   I would highly recommend the hotel for 1-2 night stay if you are in Athens due to its close proximity to the Olympic Stadium & Acropolis.  Regards. Akie\n",

It was because I was on a business trip due to an audit on software, developed by a company in Marousi. In any case, I stayed there for 3 weeks and I can give a clear opinion about this hotel. In all honesty, this hotel is an absolute hit. As a frequent business traveler, I often visit hotels. However, I immediately felt at home here. All the staff are extremely friendly. The superior room (I had room 1827) has a stunning view. The room may be slightly outdated, but who cares about such details? The breakfast is very complete. The dinner and the room service are at a high level. Last but not least, this hotel has an incredible pool bar and swimming pool on the top floor. Amazing!…\n",

The hotel is much less expensive than ones closer to the Acropolis but it is in a very safe neighborhood (and not everywhere in Athens is safe!) and it’s a high-rise and has everything you need. The rooftop pool is very nice, especially when it’s hot, but it’s not easy finding an umbrella. Also we did not care for the rooftop restaurant. The food was overpriced and mediocre and service by the wait staff was horrible. I would recommend spending the extra few euros to get a room on the 17th or 18th floor because they have nice views and are quieter than other floors (many of which are filled with noisy tourists).

      "Review is :If you’re booking this hotel to use the pool, abstain. The pool itself is nice, but the sunbed situation is a disgrace. 12 sunbeds for a hotel of 500+ beds. When asked for alternative seating, you’re told to sit on the blazing hot, stone hard floor (if you want to lay by the pool).   They are being extremely cheap by not adding more sunbeds, excusing themselves by blaming it on ‘health and safety’ - complained to a manager but absolutely nothing was done about it, except offering me a free drink/food once I had already had dinner.   Quote on quote from a member of staff: “We have 500+ beds, you don’t expect us to have 500 sunbeds, do you?!”   That’s not the customers problem. If we’re paying, we have the right to full access to ALL facilities. If I wanted to sit on the floor,…\n",

The breakfast was good as well, very fresh and many options. They were also very kind at reception and gave some guidance to explore the city. The only minus thing was the pool open very late, at 10.30. Thank you President hotel for great stay!\n",

Like most we arrived early in the morning before checkin, they provided a secure place for us to store our luggage and off we went to explore Athens. When we returned our rooms were ready and waiting for us. We booked a Superior Room high in the 20 floor building, it provided a fabulous view of the city. They accommodations were great, reasonably priced and in a good location. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The roof top bar was a must see at night. Breakfast was included in our rate, it was buffet style with plenty of options for all.\n",

The first nights meal was for a starter a bowl of lettuce leaves, main course a small piece of overcooked salmon with couscous and dessert a very small creamy thing that was more fitting for a 4 year olds birthday party. Second nights meal was a slight improvement as they served us at the table. The third night we were also served at the table and had no choice of food.

      "Review is :Recently stayed at this hotel for the one night; it was recommended to me by a travel agent. However, I would only recommend this property if staying for a short period - I found there were better situated hotels that appeared less crowded.   I attempted to go to the breakfast buffet (included in price) however it was the most chaotic scene I have experienced - they ran out of cutlery, plates, people fighting over the former and the food, and I had to eat in a different room due to lack of tables. Ended up leaving and purchasing breakfast elsewhere. However, the rooftop pool and bar looked clean, modern and with less crowds.   The actual room I was accommodated in was dated and noisy. It would have been nice maybe ten years ago; now it requires refurbishment.\n",

The rooftop bar area is very nice. The buffet room accomodates the large tour groups that stay at this hotel, and they try to offer a broad selection of food.  However, they have a “security guard” that prevents guests from eating early, and the front desk staff were not helpful — they are not customer focused... they seem to be more concerned with preventing abuse by a few guests and have made it an unpleasant experience.\n",

Three stops to the Palaka and four stops to the Acropolis. The roof pool and restaurant are very nice. Breakfast was to be included with our stay, but we left earlier than it was to be served in the last day. Our representative warned us to take food from the day before so something seemed to be off. Most hotels pack you a bag with something to honour their end of the bargain but not this one.

This hotel is definitely a great value as the price is reasonable and it offers an amazing rooftop view, lounge and pool.

Ladies, if you need a hairdryer I recommend you bring one as the one provided barely dried my beard after 10 minutes of use.  We spent very little time in the hotel other than breakfast and some late night drinks, so it fit our need quite well. Definitely not a 4 or 5 star, but a solid 3 star with some 4 star amenities.

We really loved the interior of the hotel, such as the lobby, bar and the Penthouse restaurant, which was very good. Food was excellent there. The breakfast was decent but a little repetitive. Would have liked to see more variety or change.   We loved using the rooftop pool but you have to be there for it opening to secure a bed. We witnessed several arguments over pool beds, especially on windy days when towels fall off. I think removing the unnecessary decorative furniture and adding more beds is better, along with not accepting Greek paying locals to use the pool during peak holiday season. Also, the notion of “no water bottles for tax…\n",

I stayed for one night and this was fine, but would rather try out another hotel before I returned.   Location: not really in central Athens, but then not far from a metro station (line connects to airport) to get to the center quickly.  Rooms: fairly spacious (also the bathroom) but clearly dated. Mattress needed to be renewed as felt more like a hammock. AC very loud, so I switched it off, but if you open window very noisy from road. Room had a funny smell.  Breakfast: Buffet in the basement in a dark room, but choice was surprisingly wide. Eggs, cake, tomatoe, yoghurt, etc Have seen better, but also worse breakfast, so overall ok.\n",

The view from the 21st floor restaurant is tops, great for catching the sunset and all the lights coming on. The food is OK but the drinks pricey.   For a nice meal turn right from the front of the hotel go about two blocks until you start seeing little restaurants, turn right and when you get to one called 50/50, its not far along, go in, food, service and prices are great.

You can’t eat by the pool you have to sit inside at the restaurant. Couldn’t order any lunch until after 1.00pm so ordered a snack and the bread was dry and almost off, tasted a few days too old. Went downstairs to order lunch and told couldn’t until after 3.00pm. Breakfast was buffet and 50% of the tables were used and hadn’t been cleaned, dirty plates left behind.. certainly need extra staff working as we couldn’t find a clean table.

The reception is not efficient at all at check in and check out. Arrived early at the hotel, around 9 am. We were 5 persons, I had sent all information month prior and I had a written confirmation from the hotel. I had to provide again the information(names, rooms). They took all the passports and started check in. It took them about 20 minutes or more. Finally they told us - we can check in after 14h, and that we may leave our luggage in the luggage compartment. Why this took them so long?! We came back for check in after 14h, it took them again about 20 minutes because they wanted to prepay all the rooms. Usually…\n",

Big tables with many dirty plates on them (no people eating), only one coffee machine (which was out of service). Poor English of the personnel in the roof bar. The location is not favorable at all. You should take the metro (at a 10-15 minutes walk) for 3 stops in order to reach the city centre.\n",

This may have been a lovely hotel 20 or 25 years ago, but it is now showing its age and there is little evidence that hotel management is making the investments needed to stave off decline.  The carpet in my room, for instance, had several old cigarette burns.  Our room had a lovely view of the sea which was marred by filthy windows.  And this morning, I noticed a 2 inch bug scurrying for cover.    The free internet is worth what you have to pay for it.  Frustratingly, borderline unusably, slow. A third of the desk was taken up by a 32\" TV (which easily could have been mounted on the wall), thus making it difficult to use the desk for work.  There was only one accessible outlet, this in an age in which many people travel with a laptop,…\n",

The checkin staff were fine and we made our way to our room. The room was ok, dated and basic though. The fridge was empty and there was no complimentary water. In the morning we had breakfast which was disappointing in terms of choice. The hot option was at best warm.   We checked out later that morning as we had an appointment to attend. When we returned to collect our case (we left it with the concierge) we thought we’d spend a couple of hours around the pool before moving on.

I had a room on the 18th floor, which has a nice view of the city and the sunrise each morning, and the rooftop bar is nice. I would choose another hotel to stay in if I were to return to Athens.\n",

Had three days a massive pain in my back and so did my boyfriend. We booked a double bed and at the counter they said that it was to bad for us ,cause they where booked full. We made the booking like 2 months ago. They said they looked at it and will let us know. Never heared of them again. Then the second day we where showering, we found out it wasnt cleaned and that we didnt got new towels.  The building looks that it starts to fall appart, and so does the rooms. They call themself a president hotel ,but shouldn't be alloud to call themselfs a centerparks even. Better have a look for another hotel if you dont want a free…\n",

Free breakfast was adequate and loads to eat. We had no problems finding a table.  The roof top pool was fantastic with amazing views, but does , not surprisingly, get very crowded so you are lucky to get a lounger. The size of the is very big.  Only drawbacks are it is only open until 7pm and you have to pay extra if you want to use the pool after you have checked out - 20 euros each!    Only other negative thing is wi fi costs a lot to use  Taxi charge flat rate of 38 euros to airport which for 4 people is good  I would happily stay at hotel again as very good value for money.\n",

Really disappointing that despite providing a fridge in the room there is no tea/coffee facilities given the international status if the hotel you would expect this. Bathroom is a good size and clean towels everyday which is appreciated.  Pool bar is great and clearly the selling point of the hotel as its on the roof and has great views and good view of the sunset. Very busy during the day, opens at 10.30, get there early if you want a sunbed. Towels are free and there is a lifeguard on duty.  Food in the hotel is a mixed bag.

Cons: One female staff member in the lobby was a little snobby when we arrived. Rooms are a bit dated and on the smaller side. Use of wifi in the rooms comes with an extra charge.\n",

The overall feeling was \"depressing.\" When we walked into the room, there was a funk hanging in the air, spots on the carpet, and it did not look clean. Our A/C unit was rattling loudly due to the high winds outside (which was only resolved after the winds died down).  The bathrooms need to be redone because the tiles look grimy. The rooms and bathrooms are quite noisy, as you can clearly hear others in their bathrooms flushing and people talking in the hallways. We found it VERY overpriced for what we ended up getting.

The pool can be visited from 10 am to 7 pm... very short time.  The breakfast buffet is a bit expensive for what it offers so you are better having breakfast in any of the coffee shops there are just crossing the street.  To get to the center, you have to take a taxi that will charge you around 10 euros. I would not choose this hotel again.\n",

We made our way to our room and were happy with the size and layout, albeit without a double bed (there were two single beds pushed together.) Okay, no biggie.

Clearly We had made the worst choice to stay here for a night, Let me start by letting you all know that we were cheated with the wrong room, Our Air-condition was not working so we had to complain about it and When We complained about it We were told that you'll have to deal with it, We are Sorry we dont have any other room so obviously after a long argument we were given a room, let me tell you all that the new room that were given to us in the name of upgrade had 3 different single beds instead of 1 whole bed so me and my wife had to spend the whole night in different beds.

They charge you extra for the use of a bathrobe and 2 bottles of water and consider it as a better room..!  The room had stains and mold on the ceiling and the carpet had big stains on it.

The rooms smell like stale cigarettes, the wifi - only available for free in public areas AFTER checking into Facebook for the access code - doesn't work. The shower is made almost inaccessible by having to climb over the toilet - though perhaps that would explain why the toilet seat was so dirty. The beds are made with ripped sheets. There was no tea or coffee making facilities, and no bath mat or hand towel. The walls are paper thin, so you could hear everything from the next room.

I have travelled all over Greece and sadly have to say this IS the worse hotel i have ever stayed in.   I adore Greece but this hotel is not at all typical. Greek people are renowned for friendliness. The staff in this hotel are akin to leeches. Looking for ways to take your money. One example is whilst you wait to go to the airport for your flight you have to pay to use pool n sunbeds.   We were 6 adults n 4 children n had to pay 80 euros so the kids could continue to use the pool. The adults had to dit elsewhere which really is not safe for children.

We had spent a week in the Pindos Mountains in the North country and had tramped across Athens from Larissa station so we were reassured by this. If, however, you were looking for a more authentic Athenian experience, this would not be the place for you. We didn’t really interact with the staff, but when we did they were friendly and helpful.

I asked the reception about the internet Mbps i get for that amount of money and whether the connection was dedicated or public. The reception couldnt find out that info for me even though i asked 3 times. The reception only knew that the average access is about 14Mbps... and i am prety much sure it was public access and not 14Mbps for each customer. This is way too low for a 250+ room hotel. Eventualy i dint buy it as i was not sure what i was paying for .. and used my 4G connection instead. Its realy sad not to have decent internet access in 2016.\n",

I absolutely loved the sky bar and pool. I spent most of my time in the hotel there. The staff was friendly, and willing to try to help me when I had questions about different things in Athens.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Athens!\n",

Also the room was clearly a smoker's compartment, which left quite a bad smell. And above all it was not THAT clean. The beds were rather worn, the windows thin, and so your night is rather noisy because of the main road right in front of the hotel. But what would you expect close to the centre in every big city?  But these are details. By and large, the hotel is ok. Breakfast is good, the rooftop bar offers outstanding views, although the pool was closed.

The room was clean but the carpet and the furnitures were very old and need replacement. Very narrow bathtub.  Breakfast has a variety of choices but many times with low quality products.

I could dry my hair faster blowing on it.  The help at the desk was wonderful.  I also really enjoyed the rooftop bar and pool.  You can see a bit of the Parthenon from there.  If I were going to be in Athens longer, I'd go closer to the Plaka. But the metro gets you there.\n",

The room was very smelly from cigarettes, although that was a non-smoking one.

The ones that are higher offer breathtaking views of the city, of Lykavitos and the surrounding regions. Excellent quality of bed and pillows. The quiet rooms and the excellent sleep quality are worth noting. Comfortable bathrooms with adequate amenities. Unfortunately, wifi is not free (oddly, a common practice in hotels in Athens).

It is 4 metro stops (10 mins) from the centre of Athens (Syntagma Square) or a 30 min walk (downhill) to same spot, yet a fair bit cheaper than other hotels either right in town or on the way.  Rooms large, bathroom moderate size but still comfortable, good air con, and excellent roof top (21st floor) pool and bistro.  Within 5 min walk of metro station and also excellent eateries.  Only downside is that wifi is free in communal areas of hotel i.e. pool/restaurants/lobby but speed is not great, and if you want it in your room best option is to pay 18 euros for 48 hours which is pretty ordinary - still, however, makes room tariff cheaper than others.\n",

The bathroom was very large for Greece and the beds were comfortable. Location wise it isn't the best - around 15 minutes walk to the nearest metro stop. There a few cafe's around for breakfast but nowhere nearby that was good for dinner - we ended up at TGI Friday's! All-in-all an average hotel, booked on a budget or at last minute it's perfectly suitable.\n",

      "Review is :I was housed at President Hotel while visiting Athens recently. I tried two different rooms, stayed 4 nights and struggled to get a good night's sleep. The hotel is located on a very big road and is two miles away from the central area of Athens. It is an impersonal hotel with Soviet style decor and aspect and it offers smoking and non smoking rooms. As you can imagine, this means you smell smoke everywhere!!  First night - we felt cramped in a dreary room with two beds pushed together and barely room for suitcases.  Second night - woken up at 7 am by jackhammers outside.  Third night - moved to another room, better views and light but stank of smoke and air con did not work.  The breakfast is not worth your while and the wifi is almost non existent in public areas and then you…\n",

Whatever you were asking for , always were a little bit unwilling to help. I will not make any comment about the rooms , which were just ok and nothing more but that which made us a big surprise was the unaceptable Breakfast...truly was the worst from all the hotels i had ever visited ( even though from a 1 or a 2 star hotel ) .  the time of our stay they were also some constructions taken place , and you were obligated to hear all the terrible noise of the drills. Very dissapointed !!! I i will never suggest this hotel to anyone! round this neighbour are so many better hotels\n",

Expedia charged me 75$ a night for a very small room but when I ask the front desk to keep the room for one more night they wanted 250 euro ( about 280$) wile on Expedia was still 75$. The second issue is the restaurant upstairs. Got some plain pasta with butter for my 2 year old daughter and when the bill came it wrote pasta bolognese ( meat sauce) when I asked the lovely waitress if it was a mistake she put her head down and said \" I know I am sorry but here they charge the same price with or without the sauce\" we would have gotten the sauce if we knew that was the case. The price for plain pasta and butter 15 euros.\n",

Reception is NOT strong or available in all public areas as they say and trying to find a seat in the lobby to use the wifi is set up to be difficult. It's as if they are forcing you buy the wifi.   The rooms are adequate - nothing more - nothing less. They are outdated and in need of remodeling. The only attraction is the rooftop pool and lounge (if you can get a spot). The staff closely monitor who is sitting around the pool. Don't expect you can just wonder in and grab a lounger! There is likely a wait list :-(   On the upside the view from the roof is stunning and great for taking photos although you cannot see any of the Acropolis.\n",

The beds are not good, they have a hole in the middle where everyone lays down, so you will basically have back problems after sleeping there for a couple of days. The paintings at the restaurant are very unusual they have a lot of guns which don't really match the atmosphere of the restaurant.

I was disappointed though that after a long journey I could not get a drink - there was no coffee making facilities in rooms and room service finished at 11pm. The foyer is extremely spacious though seating available is quite limited.  The bedrooms are very dated and in need of refurbishment, though the bed was very comfortable with very soft cotton sheets and plumped up pillows.  Wifi is only free in the communal areas which is inconvenient.  Breakfast in very spacious restaurant was good overall, though food was not kept hot.

The first day buffet breakfast was ok..not much variety. the next day half of the guests had to be sent to another room and it looked as if they quickly arrange breakfast in another room as they were not prepared to handle too msny guests. In the other buffet breakfast room ,there was no toaster to toast the bread. There was on,y brown bread and that too only few slices in the tray. very poor sevice. we had breakfast on dirty table.\n",

It's a nice hotel to stay at for a few days, but I wouldn't spend 10 days there. Personally I would not go back to that hotel because I find it outrage that the hotel charges for internet in the rooms. It is free in the lobby so you end up with a packed lobby: people checking their emails, arriving guests checking in, suitcases....all a bit chaotic. I travel all around and have access to internet in small hotels/guest houses in the remotest of places.

Must try Raeti restauant, small Cretan restaurant run by a family. The food is excellent (the mother cooks everything).  Rooms are well equiped, clean and big for an European hotel, I was surprised. Bathroom a little small, but again, Europe. The breakfast in the morning good, enough choice.  The view from the pool on the roof is amazing the night, have to try the lounge for the veiw (food though and drinks quite expensive).\n",

As i checked in late when I realised that there was any water I called the reception and ask if I could have some. The answer (at 23.30 in the midnight) was either to get dressed and go to the 20th floor bar and buy a bottle (€2.10) or to go outside the hotel at a quiosk around!! Lovely choices!! Not at a 2* hotel but at a 20storey and 4* hotel, one of the well known in Athens as it is large and close enough to the centre! After that I tried to sleep. But no.

It is easy to get to the centre from here, it is between two metro stations, about 10 mins walk, and just a few stops to the centre. One journey is just 1.20 euro, or 4 Euro for all day. In my view it is better than the other hotels in the area (I went to look at two others) in terms of being a generally nicer hotel for the communal areas and rooftop bar.

The road outside is exceptionally busy night and day so if you want a break from traffic noise forget it or ask for a room at the back - think you still hear it but obviously not as loud.  No credit card taken at check in so…\n",

Asked the reception for a late checkout, staying until 4pm costs almost the same as paying for an extra night so we settled for a 1.30pm checkout. Recepption recorded our room numbers, all very organised we thought. Following day returned to room at 1pm to find we were locked out, even though we had gone through the process of extending our checkout they still couldn't summon the organisational skills to not lock us out! Had to traipse back down to reception where receptionist behaved appallingly, sarcasm is neither professional or attractive.

      "Review is :The President Hotel has a very nice lobby and great roof-top pool but those two areas are the best part and only locations with free wifi. Everywhere else in the hotel you need to pay for it which is very inconvenient and a rip-off. The bedrooms are average. Outdated decor but bed is comfortable. Carpets look a bit worn and while the bathroom was clean it also looked rough around the edges. Breakfast was not good at all. Hardly any fresh fruit and the only pieces there were not even ripe. Otherwise limited menu for a 4-star hotel. Drinks and food at pool area are very expensive. Our 1-night stay at this hotel was fine but would certainly look for another hotel when returning to Athens.\n",

If your'e stuck here with a tour group you'll probably be fine, but if traveling for vacation or holiday, you can do much, much better.  Offered poor service and tried to nickle-and-dime you out of everything.  Specifically:   - Rooms were standard - not worth the price.   - Charge for wifi.

Two lifts have been completely replaced , most rooms have new carpets and the cleanliness  has been improved. The breakfast is very comprehensive and the value is outstanding , if you consider that breakfast for two is 40 Euros and swimming pool access is 60 Euros it means that you get your room for free.

The rooms are a good size with a great quality  duvet and pillows making the bedroom very comfortable. The bathroom, though small, is modern and also the shower works well. Negatives: The hotel did not have the same personable service we had come to experience at other hotels in Athens and in greece. The experience left you feeling rather cold.

The hotel itself does not appear to have been updated since the 80s, although the bar/restaurant on 21st floor is attractive and has a great view - but it must be one of the few high-rise hotels from which the Acropolis is NOT visible.  The bathroom was very dark, with one single light above the basin, the room was quite small and the furnishings had seen better days. The windows do not open, so you are reliant on air-con for 'fresh' air.  Breakfast was plentiful, but not of a high standard. I really wouldn't stay there again and cannot recommend this hotel\n",

The room was a decent size with everything you might need (with the exception of a populated mini bar). I would recommend to have two room keys so that you can keep the aircon working when you are not in the room. Also you may need some help with the aircon remote - not that intuitive for those of you still wondering why iPADs are cool.  The 21st floor has a pool and excellent bar.

The rooms are old fashion and jaded. The roof top pool is a lovely area but not enough shade and the large sunshade umbrellas are lowered at any hint of a breeze. There are not enough sunbeds to accommodate the clients. The service is slow you will wait forever to be served in the Restaurant area around the pool.

Reception staff in particular were charming and helpful.  The room was of a good size and spotlessly clean.  Public areas were impressive as were the two bars on the ground floor and on the roof.

Otherwise though very clean. Breakfast although big was of low quality. Otherwise staff was accomodating and friendly. All in all ok.\n",

      "Review is :We booked this hotel through edreams and got a fantastic rate. The hotel itself is located in a good part of town and 5 minutes away from panormou square with lots of shops and places to eat.   The lobby is impressive and has bar area plus seperate seating area where the kids were just happy to use the free wifi.  The rooms are large and spacious but quite dated. The ac in the room only works at a certain temperature which we found out on the second day. The room also has a small mini fridge which you can put your own drinks in.   Room service is reasonably priced and the food of a good quality.   The highlight of the hotel had to be the stunning rooftop pool and bar area with great views over Athens.

My room and bathroom were HUGE, bed very comfortable.  Breakfast was great and nice duration.  Note that the lobby is actually HUGE - you have to walk back from the entrance and the wifi is actually stronger back there!  Agree that location isn't fabulous -not really an area you'd want to walk around but close to transportation and quick/cheap cab ride to major sites. (approx. 8eu to Acropolis and Monastiraki).  Didn't get to use the pool, but rooftop lounge was amazing and service was as expected.

Glad we did, clientele has vastly improved and it really is a great penthouse/ pool for summer. Unfortunately pool closes at 7 pm when it's still so lovely and the sunsets at 8.30. Our aircon didn't work first night and it was HOT. Next day they fixed it and it was perfect.  Drinks are very expensive, €7 a beer? But service is good. No restraunts or anything, close by but they do have a well kept secret, a daily lunch and different dinner set menu every day, €17 lunch or dinner, 3 courses.  We had it twice and it was really fresh and great variety. Great salad, followed by stuffed pork tenderloin, lovely choice of desert or just ice cream.…\n",

Location is far from it he main tourist attractions and you would have to take a cab or the metro (which isn't very nearby). Our other main issue was that there weren't too many restaurants within walking distance and it made eating dinner more challenging. The restaurant in the hotel was mediocre at best.  In the end, you get what you pay for with this hotel. I would have stayed somewhere closer to the main attractions or public areas if I had known.   Wouldn't stay again.\n",

The location is OK but not great. Despite being advertised as being close to the Metro, it isn't. It is at least a 10 minute walk and the location of the station is not easy to find. That did not worry me but would upset many travelers including those with heavy bags or children, or those who can't walk long distances.   From this location, almost all tourist attractions are either a metro ride or a cab ride away. Walking is only for the very energetic.

The room we stayed had a television which did not function and a broken shower unit . The hotel should be rated not more than a 3 star as it has nothing besides a pool .\n",

      "Review is :This hotel was probably the most familiar feeling to the group of Americans I was with.  A larger room with a double bed, elevators, etc.  It felt like being in many other cities.  I appreciated that there were two computers in the elevator lobby available for patrons, since I was traveling with only my cellular phone and it gave me a chance to really check/send email.  The bathroom was large and clean, and I was quite comfortable in the room.  The only drawback was that the room smelled faintly of cigarette smoke, but I suppose that's to be expected in Europe!  It was in a very busy commercial district, so if you needed something, it was probably within walking distance. The subway was about a 10-15 minute walk away, so that was good, too!\n",

Also in my booking i had some preferences which they did not see it.....But OK.......The room was OK, people OK  and the restaurant too small (we need to take the breakfast from the one room to another because there was no place to sit....)   The most unacceptable thing for me was that at the 2nd night when i return back to hotel the night reception-guide thought that i was a outside person and i want to hotel for someone or something??? and he was follow me with the lift until to be sure that i had truly a room there....ANACCEPTABLE!!!!!

It was perfectly located with easy access to taxis, walking to Embassy and other places.  We were on a tour with EF Tours so a lot of people (49) and check in and check out were not stressful at all.  The breakfast buffet was great one morning, especially the Greek yogurt.  The bar on the rooftop was really nice with great drinks and amazing views.  Only two blocks from a Starbucks which was essential given that we had not had our daily latte for two weeks touring through Europe.  However, the cappucino and Greek coffee we had at restaurants were far better.  Beds were great.  My only complaint was that the air conditioning did not get the room very cold.  Wifi was not…\n",

The swimming pool on the roof is great- you have a view over the city and I loved the vibe of the bar! (later on we stayed in a so called 4-star hotel and we enjoyed this hotel much more). Even though it is not in the center of the city- it is close to a train station. Easy to go around and close by there is a few nice restaurants!  We had a lovely breakfast the next morning! I would recommend this if you are on a budget and you are traveling with kids/teens! Free WiFi in the lobby- so that was also great!\n",

Although the hotel is facing a very busy two-lane avenue, no noise was heard in the room. The room was quite large and very bright with a large window occupying a full wall. The furniture was simple. The bathroom was also large but a bit dated and in need of refurbishing, taking into account that it is a four star hotel.  Everything in the hotel was spotless clean.

The hotel webpage does list a variety of amenities, which are pretty standard, for the most part. There is TV (CRT!) in the room, a fridge, and air con. The standard of decor is, however, quite basic and really does need a makeover - it has a lived-in, dated look. The communal areas, including the lobby, bar and rooftop pool are clean and modern. In other words, this is a hotel of contrasts - the communal areas are to a good standard but the rooms are pretty basic.

They bundled me into a taxi and sent me to another hotel a few kilometres, and a few less stars, down the road. The people there were extremely kind, but it was a very basic hotel and not at all equivalent to what I had paid for at the President.

One way narrow roads in a super busy part of Athens. Parking is done by a third party parking lot and its a terrible layout if you are trying to get luggage inside the hotel. Parking is ridiculously expensive. The lobby is packed with knick knacks which people think is cool - I think it looks crowded, dirty and chaotic. The staff is indifferent about customer service. The rooms are old and musty, even in a non smoking room. The breakfast is the quality of a gigantic cafeteria.

You're in the middle of a busy city on a very busy road, if you want peace and quite then you're in the wrong place.   Yes some lifts go to the odd floors and others go to the even floors which is tricky when there are tour groups but get in any available lift and walk up/down one flight of stairs to the floor you need. The stairs are easy to walk up and down and the flight is short so easy even for the people that aren't very fit.   The lobby and bar is very grand and clean.

There are large umbrellas for shade  will not allow them to be used if slightest wind which there was every day even though they are firmly secured with concrete slabs and guide wires.  the life guard better named towel police spends every second confronting all that enter young old frail and outlines the rule again and again no private towels.

I was aware that the reviews aren't particulaly great so was expecting some issues  Let's start with the positives. The redeeming feature has to be the roof top pool and it provides a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of Athens. It never feels busy, at least. It in the day time. I never went up at night. Whilst many people complained about the decor of the room, this wasn't an issue, it's a mid range hotel, I was t expecting much. The beds were comfortable and that's one of the main issues for me  The negatives. Checking in was a joke.

The rooms are clean and spacious and the only thing I can recommend is for the Wi-Fi to also be free in the rooms, as it is now in the public areas and maybe offer a mini bar in the rooms. If you visit especially in the summer time do not forget to have a drink on the roof garden. Spectacular views and wonderful atmosphere. Also do ask for a room on a high floor.

I had to stand there for 15mins because the guy literally went somewhere else while preparing the code for me (like one minute he's talking to me and the next one he goes somewhere) (?!) Any problem that was there was my own problem that I had to sort out - I didn't feel welcomed, I didn't feel like a real guest.  2) The location - is the strongest point of the hotel, it's pretty close to downtown Athens.

Anyway to cut it short: I have changed my room 3 times , From 315 to 614 to 1614(The worst) and finally 1623  - Filthy carpets in all rooms , - Ancient bathrooms (the hair dryer \"a piece from the past\") - Beds are extra small, and the pillows are exhausted.

The check in took over 30 minutes and when I asked for a wake up call I was referred to a colleague sitting next to the person who handled my check in. Had to stand in line again .... The elevators are a nightmare. Since not all worked there was a waiting line to get in the elevator. I was on the 14th floor and the next morning the elevators were packed. Waited 25 minutes and looked at 4 elevators that were full. Ultimately took the stairs and walked 14 floors to get my breakfast. The breakfast buffet is average at best. Rooms were clean but a bit out dated. My advice is do not go there, Athens has for sure better alternatives.\n",

Rooms are clean and comfortable, but things like old style box TV's are a bit dated. Staff could do with smiling a bit more and often look a bit miserable.

Although the hotel looks and feels very nice you will realise after a few days that there are holes all over the place.

Pool opens late and closes early, you can only eat in certain areas, 10 Euro deposit for towels, etc. NOT like any other Luxury hotel I have stayed at where the guests and their needs seem to come first. Not a lecture about where I can or can't eat my 20 Euro salad. Strange.    Rooms are really dated. In need of new bathrooms, carpets and T.Vs.

The hotel's location is good: close (walkable) to the centre of Athens, with access easily to the city's metro and bus stops very close to the hotel's entrance. The staff were also very helpful in booking taxis for us when required.   The rooms are good quality; I think the 4-star rating is, overall, fair. The air conditioning in rooms is not easy to work, however. The reception area is grand. The rooftop pool area is good (at the top of the hotel's approximate 20 floors), though there were complaints about taking room towels here, yet it's not clear at all that this is not permitted until challenged on it. The Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel, but is expensive in rooms, unless using in the free lobby and 'public'…\n",

Location is just ok, not near any interesting tourist destinations but the surrounding are is clean and relatively modern. Breakfast was good but again, nothing special to mention. Wifi is free at common areas but slow. During our visit, the parking area is under some constuction works and we are told to park at the aisles which was not exactly nice because we are not sure of the safety and it makes extra hassle to find parking spots plus we have to then walk to and fro from hotel.\n",

      "Review is :The President Hotel in Athens was probably 4 star in its heyday - perhaps the 60's - 80's.  Its size (21 floors) and proximity to the american embassy help.  However, the photos are a bit coy.  Yes, the rooftop and lobby are nice, meeting rooms aplenty, and the views are superior above the 10th floor.  But as with a hotel that once served the business class, you will find amenities are all extra.  Wifi only in the lobby.  Lounge chairs at the pool extra. Location not all that advantageous (metro a 10 min walk).  Breakfast decent but geared to the legions of tour bus people that roll in.  Bathrooms a little old, some odors, etc.  So, its a lady keeping appearances but a little tired.  A true four star view but not much else. Athens has many newer smaller boutique properties with…\n",

Helpful staff, I had a problem with the safe and the technician appeared in 10 minutes. Independent air conditioning is working fine; I assume it is vital during summer. It is about 25 minutes walk to the old town or it is possible to buy a day underground ticket and use the underground. Room was clean, bathroom big and with bathtub.  Breakfast is included in the price; nothing fantastic but is sufficient to start a day.  The only drawback is the internet which is free everywhere except the room. To use it in the room you must pay and it is not cheap. Overall impression positive. Will consider staying there if I am in Athens again.\n",

The decor was quite dated and the bathroom was exceedingly small. The bath tub was half the size of a normal bath and our legs touched the wall when using the toilet! Also, the TV did not work.

Don't be put off by the exterior as inside the public areas are well appointed - with free WiFi - and the rooftop terrace and pool very comfortable, although for the pool we were \"out of season\".  And an added, and unexpected, bonus - valet parking!  But the other reason is how they handled a problem.  We had our rental car broken into and GPS stolen.  At first we thought this had happened whilst the car was at the hotel.  The duty manager was very responsive and explained very clearly how this could not have happened and what their night security staff ad reported when we returned one evening.

When first arriving at the hotel, my initial impression was that it was an older hotel, but at least looked well preserved by way of the appearance of the lobby.  It had that sort of cool 60's vibe and look to it.   The first signs that things were going down hill were the fact that there were odd and even floored elevators, which by todays day and age you would thing would have been upgraded.  Upon arriving at my floor, the smell whilst not terrible, was at the same time, not clean and fresh by any means.  The room was fairly sizeable, but the layout was amiss.

One of the bed mattress was completely deformed with a huge \"hole\" in the middle which caused a significant back pain after one night sleep.  We asked to change rooms on the second night and they gave us a double room right next to the elevators. I must say that room isolation is non existent. You can totally ear everything from the other rooms, from corridors and specially from outside. Although we were on the 19th floor we could ear traffic almost the same way as if we were outside. It almost seemed we had the window opened...                                          The…\n",

Keep in mind that the rooms are average but clean, the furniture are so-so, the space affordable and the view (no balcony) from the top floors excelent.

      "Review is :Very nice Hotel, with a magnificent pool set on the roof, with a covered lounge/bar area. The views from here were stunning, the whole of Athens laid out before your eyes. It's about a ten minute walk to the nearest metro, so easy to get about the city from here. The room was nice, with a good bathroom, even included a retractable washing line for the stalls.big fluffy towels, good shower (inside the bath) There is parking on site, but costs ten Euros per day. Don't bring the car! The breakfast was excellent.the usual continental cakes and breads, but also hot bacon, eggs, etc.fresh fruit and a decent cup of tea to be had, all buffet stye. Breakfast starts at six thirty, great for those doing early excursions, etc. staff were very helpful.\n",

Since the Contiki booked the hotel for the next night I figured it would be in our best interest to stay at the same hotel so we didn't have to run around and look for another one.  I was very happy I decided to stay with Presidents.  The views from our room were amazing!  The people at the front desk listened very well when I asked them to put us in a room with a view. Wow!  Also the pool is on the roof of the hotel!  Not only was the pool amazing, there was also a great clubby low key type music playing at night.  It was chill yet hip, and also had the same amazing views of Greece.  The decor of the hotel is Greek Elegance. Very nice with a small modern twist.  Also the breakfast is…\n",

Location-wise, the hotel is around a 30 minute walk (or 5/10minute taxi ride, which costs around 4euro during the day, 8euro after 11pm) from the main central area around Syntagma Square - which is where many of the more 'traditional' restaurants are, and leads to the Monistiraki flea market and Acropolis etc. Despite not being in what I would regard the 'main centre', this does not mean to say the hotel is 'out in the sticks', quiet or removed from amenities - there are a few bakeries, bars, supermarkets and clothing and shoe shops literally a minute or two away from the hotel. As I mentioned it's only a few minutes taxi-ride away from the Monistiraki flea market, Acropolis, and…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed at President hotel for 1 night before our flight. You can easily get to the airport by taking the X95 bus that has a stop 5 minutes walking from the hotel (about 40 minutes ride when there's no traffic). However, it took us about 1.5 hours to get to the hotel from the port of Piraeus, using 2 trains. The neighborhood  is OK but there isn't really anything to see in the area, so if you want to explore Athens you need to take a Metro/bus/taxi.  Pros: Good location if you need to get to the airport, very friendly staff, nice roof bar near the pool (though expensive...), good breakfast from 6:30 (important when you have an early flight!).  Cons: The hotel rooms looks quite old and the beds are very soft (not typical for Greece). Moreover, Wifi internet costs minimum 4…\n",

A nice member of staff tried to manage the situation but couldn't. And then they still charged me full price, saying we hope you come back to visit. I stayed 7 nights and the all night party was the last night. Otherwise I would have left earlier. If they have compensated me in some way I would have left with a better opinion of the hotel and management. Will never go back and would not recommend it.\n",

That's the positive, and there's enough there to make for a nice stay.  But it needs to be said that you never wait for less than 5-10 minutes for tiny elevators, and breakfast, although very good, will probably be eaten standing, as there are not nearly enough tables for guests. Maybe I was just there during a busy time, but there were hundreds of kids running around, yelling and smoking.    Also, there was a problem with my bill when checking out. It was fixed after some conversation, but it just left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.   This is a nice hotel, for sure. It just doesn't get top marks.\n",

The taxi cost around 40 euros but we still saved money, since we didn't have to book two rooms (we're family of 4). The room was large, which is unusual for Athens hotels. The decor was a bit dated, but not too bad. Beds were on the bumpy side, but the linen clean and fresh.

The breakfast buffet was big so lots of choice. There was a huge group of noisy school children on the last night but that wasn't really the hotel's fault.  The internet sounded more expensive than it was because it was €8 for 24 hours but the 24 hours could be taken at any time so it was €0.33 per hour which I consider reasonable (and it worked well).

The rooms were reasonably sized but decor was dated and with the oldest TV I've seen in a long while - not even flat screen, never mind plasma! The minibar was completely empty and wifi was extortionate at 8 euros/hour. There is an internet/business suite with desktop computers but even here you have to pay the same for connection.

The room I was shown in was like being in a 2 star hotel! The bed was tiny. The window could not seal and heavy traffic was audible. Called them and asked for another room. The staff was very helpful and in 15 minutes I was shown to another room at the same floor(2nd) which was more spacious, better furnished, still the bed was tiny! Avoid this prepaid rooms at all costs!  On the plus the rooftop bar-restaurant is excellent. A large pool makes all the difference. Nice music, food and drinks!\n",

      "Review is :I stayed overnight at the President Hotel prior to boarding a cruise ship bound for the Greek Islands in mid May.. I checked in on a Sunday afternoon and was met with very polite staff. I believe the hotel to be a little aged and in need of a renovation. However, the room was quite large, the bed comfortable and the bathroom to be larger than most. The buffet breakfast choices were varied and the lobby lounge was large enough to cater for groups of travelers. It was a little disappointing that a \"4 Star\" hotel in Europe did not have free wifi in the rooms as most other establishments I've stayed at almost always had their internet service as being complimentary however, there was free wifi (low signal) at the lobby. The big draw card for the hotel was definitely the rooftop pool…\n",

The minibar in the room is empty so if you want drinks you either have to call room service or go outside and buy drinks on your own (probably cheaper - across the street is a kiosk that sells cold cans of Coke and Diet Coke and other drinks at 1Euro/can.  The bathroom lighting is weak so if you need to shave or put on makeup you'll have to do that outside the bathroom.  Judging by the carpet and room decor, this hotel was probably upscale in 1988 but has seen its share of wear and tear as well as the afterthought of adding individual room A/Cs.

We had a bit of a new hire mistake with the internet (added cost), and the desk choose not to correct it (only a review of their policy (their 2 computers are fast, but have some working bugs (I was not able to open some emails))).  I recommend your own device, and go down the street to StarBucks, spend your money there and enjoy their connection (which is what we did rather than further support the hotel's poor system).\n",

It does seem to lack a little personality; maybe it is the feeling of everything being slightly disorganized or the bus loads of teenage children passing through (February 2013) or the strange way one set of lifts accommodates all the even floor numbers while the other set the odd floor numbers..! The view from the pool garden on the roof is amazing – a definite recommendation! On the whole I find the hotel is pleasant enough to stay for a couple of nights. .\n",

Lots of options to choose from and every care was taken to see that the each dish was prepared with quality in mind. 3. The view!! Fantastic, to say the least.

It is not the place to go for a romantic weekend or if you are looking for something special. Is the typical average business hotel (not an Hilton of course). Rooms are clean but dated, especially the bathrooms that need an hard refurbishment. The hall is wide and staff is decently polite. The hotel has some evident lacks such as the absence of directories book in the rooms and not free internet. Breakfast is absolutely average for an average hotel that has its bonus point in the position (Panormou area and metro is ten minutes walk and in any case there is always a taxi waiting in front of the hotel) and in the rates (around 70 euros for a room). The place to go if you want a clean…\n",

The furniture is a bit run-down, but as long as it is clean, I don't mind. The bathroom ventilation is not good, so it can be very hot, humid, and ... smelly. You need to open the door between the room and the bathrrom, and the window of your room and problem solved :) The staff is helpful, they helped print my e-ticket for free, but there was no freely available printer I could use. Buffet breakfast was great. I had to pay 15 euro for 24hrs of WiFi, and it was a very slow connection.\n",

      "Review is :We stayed here for just a couple of days on a flying visit to Greece. It's located on quite a busy road but traffic noise wasn't a problem.  You're near the bus stop and taxis are easy to come by. The metro is a bit of a trek but not impossible on foot and you're well located for eg the Acropolis, Plaka etc  The room was nicely kitted out cable tv not all that hot, but so what, we were out most of the time!  The only small downsides were  - Breakfast.  We left early both mornings we were there and the hotel has a service where they pack a brekkie box for you. We thought this was great til we opened it! It contained a ham and cheese sandwich. The cheese was like plastic, the ham obviously the cheapest available and the bread was DRY. And I don't just mean there was no butter, I…\n",

The staff is very helpful and booked us in around 9: 30 which is nice because Transat brought us to the hotel at 8 am straight from the boat.  The rooms are pleasant and the bathrooms are large.  The TV did not work but a technician was there within minutes to fix it.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with lots of choice and good coffee.  It would have been nice to have real juice instead of some kind of Tang drink, but every thing else was good.  The charge for the internet is 4 euro for 1 hour which is far too high and it was hard to log off so we did not get our full hour but the staff did what they could to give us a little…\n",

Then our ceiling in the bathroom started leaking so they moved us to another room. the safe didn't work there either so the tech came back.

They take large groups in the hotel (schools / tours etc). Who make it feel like a cattle market - especially at breakfast. The walls are thin, you can hear every word next door. The staff are not interested at all in helping in any way. Zero customer service skills in anything. The pool doesn't open until 10.30!

If you get a good rate, go ahead and book it, but if you have some time to dedicate you should easily find better options. If in a family trip, I would clearly go elsewhere.  Summarizing my experience, there were a few things to criticize: - The room was noisy (even if I was in floor 11!!). A colleague staying in floor 18th assured me that it was equally noisy up there, which is not acceptable. Come on! A reasonable noise isolation is not that hard to offer in a 18th floor! - Very poor breakfast: terrible juices (terrible Athens tub water + cheap fruit powder), bad coffee and (almost) no service.

Also as there were not so many people th bar would have been a good place to have breakfast or plate service in the evening instead of the basement.

I can't remember the name of it, but there's a mountain/hill that's not too far away with a church on top.

The location is good and the metro stations were 10 minutes walk which was very convenient.   This is a boring 70s highrise building which however advertises of its extensive renovation...Ok there are some touches here and there but nothing significant.. the rooms are on the small side and the decoration is box standard florals and pastels...  The Pièce de résistance of the hotel is the pool on the roof top and the bar there which admittedly have a nice ambiance and a 360 degrees view of Athens. What was extremely dissapointing was the VERY slow service, the VERY unprofessional staff (shouting at each other, wrong orders coming and going etc) and the limited/…\n",

It is located on the main drag of Athens and has easy access to the airport, the acropolis via cabs or public transportation.

But when I got there the friendly staff and the environment made me stay. It is a bit pricey but it makes up for every penny you spent.    The rooms are very comfortable and tidy, clean and well organized. Read the manual in the room before you do anything. People have made an effort to solve all the possible questions of a visitor. The view to Athens is exceptional and the more higher level your room is the view is better. For a better view and a swim there is the Pool Bar on the rooftop of the hotel...

Nice, gentle staff, very good and convenient location, amazing view from the 13th floor (this is the only hotel in Athens that can offer this thing) and a very nice swimming pool and lounge at the 21st floor with even more amazing views all over the city :).  -Cons: the rooms are absolutely dated. They need rennovation.... It seems like it's a 80s or 90s hotel and that is a shame. The swimming pool is a bit small, but there is nothing the hotel can do about that.

Lobby and swimming pool was great and so was the view from our 12th floor window. The reception staff was very helpful and was always willing to help. Cons : Far away from nearest Metro station. No good restaurant nearby and the road was unsafe at night with unwanted characters roaming or following you. Luckily we were in a group.

The hotel also has a great bar area overlooking the city and a varied and delicious complimentary breakfast.  Situated in nice part of town not too far from the US Embassy.  We all agreed that we would book this hotel if we visited Athens again.   As a side note, there had been a lot of bad press about Greece in the US media this year and all I can say is to please don't believe all that you hear.  The country was beautiful and the people are wonderful and gracious.  Go visit and see for yourself.\n",

The hotel is located on one of the busiest roads in to Athens, I was offered a room with twin beds at the rear of the building (quieter) or on 16th floor with a double bed.    My room on the 16th floor was fine, bathroom was a bit small had everything I needed and was clean.  Traffic noise wasn't that bad.  I chose not to have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on organization or choice.  Disappointed to discover that the roof terrace was closed for…\n",

The only negative part is that the rooms are a bit old and they could use a renovation.

A dining room is indeed open for dinner, but \"dinner\" consists of only two or three choices sitting in warmers on a buffet table!   The buffet breakfasts were passable, however.  Recommended only if included at no additional charge on a Mediterranean cruise, also three star (as indeed ours was).\n",

The rooftop pool and bar area was even more breathtaking than the pictures on their website, and offered a beautiful view of the city. The rooftop bar prices were not cheap, but not more than expected given the surroundings. The staff were all very nice and most spoke at least passable english. Certainly better than our Greek!\n",

The room where we stayed was  very comfortable, clean, complete with armchairs, a desk and a very spacious marble bathroom. I recommend President hotel, it is a good choice for its value.\n",

The best think of the Hotel is the lounge with a pool (really nice with goods views),also the presence of the hotel it´s ok.   The rooms are just ok, tidy but with old facilites. (noted the first nite of my four nites, they forgot change the towels and make beds.  The worst think its the American breakfast. Juices and Coffee are undrinkable, the rest are low quality.   In overall, this hotel its expensive according quality&price.\n",

It is located right next to a Carrefore, so shopping for any food items, etc. that we needed was very convenient. The best part of the hotel was the pool on the very top floor.  It was very clean with an nice bar and sitting area.  You can look our over the city and it is a good view.  This is the tallest hotel in the city, so you can imagine the view.  (You can't see the Acropolis because of the hill blocking it from your view.) The breakfast was included, but wasn't the greatest I've ever eaten.  I would give it a seven on a scale of 1-10.

It is about a 6 minute walk to the Metro and only 3 stops from the touristy area of The Plaka and the Acropolis.

Not much space, no mini bar, in my case a tap that leaked water onto the floor of the bathroom and a very ordinary shower.  Breakfast was also very disappointing. I was staying with two colleagues and all three of us decided to miss this daily 'treat'. The roof top pool is very nice but this does not make up for the minus points.  The location is also not the best for tourist with a taxi to the tourist area of Athens costing 10€.\n",

The hotel is situated just past the downtown area, and is one of the tallest buildings in Athens.

The location is well away from the city centre but a 10 minute walk gets you to either the Panormou or Ambelokipi tube stations on the blue line where you can use the excellent Metro system.  The Athens Metro is (in my book anyway) one of the best in the world being very safe, cheap and easy to use, thanks in part to the 2004 Olympic Games.  So, once on the tube you can get to the most popular locations such as the Acropolis relatively quickly.  For footy fans going to the Champions league final this May, even the New Olympic Stadium is in reach via the Metro green line from the city centre (Syntagma) to Irini…\n",

      "Review is :We booked this hotel on the Internet. We thought booking hotels was like here in the U.S., where you might be able to sometimes book a 4-star hotel at an attractive price.  When we arrived and entered our room, we were dismayed. An average Motel 6 had much better facilities than this place. The hotel was run down, despite its claim that it was recently renovated.  The hotel staff put up no resistance when we asked for a refund (probably because this was not uncommon). We promptly went to a real 4-star hotel near the Acropolis. The extra $30-35 a night was well worth it.\n",

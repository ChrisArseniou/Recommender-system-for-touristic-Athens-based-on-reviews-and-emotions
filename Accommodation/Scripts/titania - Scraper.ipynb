The rooms are tiny, dirty and dingy,  the beds are thin and seem to be covered in plastic, the furniture looks like it was bought at a garage sale, plaster is falling off the walls, and the showers doors don't hold the water in so your bathroom ends up flooded. The area the hotel is in is also super sketchy. I was not comfortable at all to leave the hotel and walk around. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.\n",

We asked reception to change rooms and they wouldn’t accommodate us. Lobby staff were not very helpful. This hotel is not even 4 star rating  standard with Greek Ministry of Tourism.

      "Review is :I paid for me and my partner to visit Athens as a surprise present for him, Titania hotel had came up upon booking this holiday and the photos presented looked absolutely amazing and I was sold due to the rooftop view outlooking the acropolis. When we  arrived to the hotel the outside was outstanding and so was the lobby I even thought at first glance this hotel was posh for us due to the fact we are a young couple and normally go for pretty standard but good hotels. When we checked in the older gentleman working when we arrived was lovley and very helpful so I cannot fault him. The rest of the lobby staff were very rude and to be completely honest very intimidating, we weren’t even greeted when we entered the hotel but instead was given dirty looks by all the staff which was of course not a great impression especially when me and my partner were so excited for our stay. We were given our room key and away we went to our room, disappointed is one of the many negative words I can use to describe the room. Paying over £1,000 for a 4 night stay I really did expect more from the rooms. The room we were placed in was very outdated compared to the lobby and front entrance to the hotel, furniture was chipped and the layout was horrific they also had pushed two single beds together to which we lay on the bed but every time we tried to get closer the beds pushed apart. Bare in mind I paid extra for a double bed and a view that outlooks the acropolis to which we received neither of these things. Instead we were faced with a view of the internal side of the building that was a starewell which was filthy and we received no natural light in the room. I went down to the lobby unimpressed by this due to the amount I paid for the certain things I hadn’t received, hotel staff told me they had none of these rooms left and to come back In the morning when people had left the hotel. The next morning I did that and it was 3 woman down at reception this time to which they were unbelievably rude giving me glares when explaining the situation. One of the woman was speaking to another employee and had pointed at me and they had started laughing I was genuinely appalled by this. We had been given another room on the same floor but just basically across the other side of the hall to which we had a double bed but the view was the same if not worse. We are not normally the type to complain so we left it at that instead of going to argue back more about the view. Every time you were in the lobby of the hotel the security guard of the hotel was very daunting and would constantly be behind you when you were doing things such as at the reception desk, weighing your case or sitting in the lobby area and constantly staring. We weren’t even farewelled goodbye when we left they had just taken our key and said we can pick our case up when we are ready to leave. The olive garden I must say was the best part of the hotel the staff up there were amazing and couldn’t do any more to help you, also served amazing food they even told you every part about your dish, the hotel lobby staff should take some tips from them as they could massively benefit on how to have customer service. Overall I am disappointed by the service and the way they treat there customers as a few times I was in the lobby quite a lot of people had been down complaining about the rooms and staff around the hotel. I wish I saved my money and went to another hotel as I can imagine staff from other hotels are potentially alot more friendlier and helpful than the staff at Titania hotel.…\n",

I shall be pursuing a refund for my final nights stay, but this was very badly handled.  In terms of stay, the hotel is conveniently located in Athens. The money has been spent in the reception, but the rooms are tired and have zero sound proofing.

Many sites are within a 20-25 minutes walk on scenic streets.  The rooms are very modern and sharp, especially the bathrooms with modern marble treatment and effective showers.  Rooms include a refrigerator and safe and reasonable shelf and closet space, missing from many hotels.  And unlike American hotels, it has daily housekeeping that’s very competent.

I agree with other reviews that the bedrooms are dated and are in need of a refurb.  However, they were clean, the reception was very presentable and it had a plesasant enough roof terrace restaurant with views of the Parthenon.  It was also in a good central location and staff were very friendly.    I would use it again for a 1 night stopoever, but would not really want to stay much longer than that, but only because of the bedrooms.\n",

The room is exceptionally old and small , with quite basic and bad decoration , while the mattress is probably 30years old and of very poor quality .  It is unbelievable that a hotel is still getting 4stars by offering such kind of terrible rooms for such price . It is worse than the majority of rooms-to-let type of offerings and they Charging a rate of 140€/night which is literally like exploiting the surge in demand in Athens . On the good side : it is convenient as a location and the amenities are clean .\n",

The room was nice & clean but the beds were not comfortable & they were lopsided plus not a spacious room. I was most disappointed with reception… they were not friendly or helpful at all. Every time we asked a question, they seemed bothered & just tried to give us quick answers… not very helpful at all, even when asking about tours.

Our 9th floor room at the back of the hotel wasn't troubled by any nightclub noises reported by another reviewer; in fact it was all very quiet.  Room was serviced daily, towels and sheets changed.  The bar and restaurant on the roof have the much-vaunted view to the Acropolis and Parthenon which is very nice indeed.  Possibly even better early morning as the low-angle sun lights the Parthenon.  The hotel is a bit further away from the Parthenon than some others but it's an impressive sight nonetheless.  The couple of niggles:  first, the buffet breakfast, which was fundamentally pretty good.  Tasty.  But on three of the five…\n",

The hotel is well situated in the city centre, had excellent air con (which helped a lot during the heatwave), we were upgraded from standard to exec, cleanliness and Covid measures were excellent (in some cases we even had to turn the lovely cleaning ladies away). Rooms above the 4th floor might be better sound wise but other than that it was great. The breakfast was also decent (perhaps they could do with offering for free other types of coffee apart from filter) but the view from the rooftop was very good. We will return!\n",

I am kicking myself for leaving my last hotel where a 20 euro upgrade got me a rooftop balcony, but they were full up unfortunately for the weekend  The breakfast is not included and costs a whopping 19 euros. For that price i could just go up to acropolis and eat there.   All in all extremely upset that i spent well over twice the price of a superior hotel to receive a substandard stay here. The only thing i feel my money got spent on is the lobby, but I wanted to pay for a room\n",

For those arriving by car, the hotel offers underground parking (while there are almost no hotels in Athens with car parking). Breakfast at the hotel is the best in town! We have been to a lot of hotels in Athens and this one of the Titania Hotel is definitely the best of all.\n",

We went to breakfast and afterwards were told we could not take a cup of coffee with us out of the restaurant.  The tub/shower was very high and difficult to get in since there was no hand hold.  The shower door wouldn't stay shut so the floor got wet.  We asked for ice to our room and were charged for it.  When we checked out, we asked for our bags to be delivered to the airport shuttle.

When I went down to complain, they did change the room to a view of “the city.” Which is a street view. The room was bigger and while promised “We’ll see how we can give you a better room tomorrow,” that never panned out. But I didn’t push it because we were settled.  The bathroom is quite small.

Check-in was easy and the staff managed to find me a room so that I didn’t have to check-out again the following day when the Tour started. On the positive side, the hotel is in a great location, close to the Metro (Syntagma and Omonia) and only one change on the Metro from the airport. The public areas were spacious and clean and the view from the rooftop bar/restaurant was fantastic, overlooking the Acropolis. Breakfast was also taken in this restaurant; the selection was good if you arrived early but on each day, it was manic with people rushing everywhere. On the first evening we had a buffet meal included in the price of the Tour. It was taken on the first floor and the…\n",

Our room windows were frosted, and opening the windows one understood why...the view was a fire escape.  Okay, no real complaint because we don't tend to hang around our room for more than sleeping and hygiene.  The beds proved very comfy.

As for booking the boat for 3 Islands and was afraid that this kind of trips are usually less than standard, so their reference was also tremendously wow. we asked for a room with balcony, and the hotel was more than fully booked, the only thing Georges said, i can't promise but will do my best, on our way back to check-in, we had the room with terrace. to call a taxi we had their officer next to us until we get into the cab.

      "Review is :The hotel is very average. Mainly for tour groups. Tiny lifts, and very spartan rooms, nothing that will inspire you in any way. Just a quick in and out hotel to sleep and don't stay in the room. Tiny telly. Bad wifi. But what will put off is the poor quality of the bedding and towels and the size of the rooms.  It is a modest 3 start with a grand entrance.  We had a car and paid only 8 euros for parking which is reasonable.  The breakfast is OK and the view from the terrace (of the Acropolis) is very nice.  Location wise is very good to around Athens on foot, but one day in Athens (one of the ugliest capitals in the world) is more than enough, Parthenon included.\n",

My room was on the 6th floor, and was spotlessly clean and more than adequate for a few nights stay. There was a tea/coffee service provided in the room, but for some reason they didn't provide spoons with this, so not great if you take milk and sugar!   Breakfast was included, although I never actually attended this myself, as our meetings started at 8.30am and with the 2 hour time difference, it felt far too early for me to eat. My colleagues however, did go for breakfast, and all of them agreed it wasn't a great experience. No issue with the food itself, but with the sheer number of people all trying to attend…\n",

Staff were helpful enough.   Disadvantages : Close proximity to Omonia, means nothing to do at night and not the best area in Athens. Hotel always seem understaffed while its not, but you get the feeling cuz things take more time than usual, even the elevator.\n",

There are some nice, cheap restaurants nearby that are obviously popular with locals. The hotel itself was very clean, we had a lovely big room on the 6th floor. The rooftop bar is incredible but very expensive - €9-10 for a cocktail. That being said, the €9 G&T I purchased had a very generous portion of gin, and the view is amazing. It is also where the buffet breakfast is served, which we found to be extensive and of a high standard. The lifts are a bit slow in the morning with everyone heading up so if you’re in a rush, plan for an extra couple of minutes. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and would…\n",

The location was great too. We found a nice bakery just down the street from the hotel which was fantastic and not expensive. Overall, I liked the hotel except for 1 minor communication problem. A few days before our arrival to the hotel, I emailed them via the email listed on their website to ask about organizing an airport transfer for when we arrived in Athens. I did not get a response.

The rooms were perfectly fine (much larger bathroom than I was expecting). But the real surprise was waiting for us on the top of the hotel. Breakfast was served from the top floor. The breakfast buffet was AMAZING. There were three entirely different buffet lines that had something for everyone. And the view was probably the greatest in Athens.

The breakfast was on the  Olive Garden Rooftop, overlooking most of Athens, including the Acropolis. Great breakfast selection and delicious food! Fantastic location, all the streets look a little dodgy, nothing beautiful.. 1.5km walk to main shopping street, 2km walk to Acropolis (very hot walk in summer)  CONS:  Limited room for suitcases on the floor in room, but there is a wardrobe.

Was not right near Acropolis or other sights, but metro station was about a 5 minute safe walk from hotel and really convenient and easy to use to get to other sights (most only a stop or two away).  (Also, could take a longer walk to get to mist sights which we did some times.)  Hotel had an AMAZING breakfast that is included and is on rooftop. Views on their rooftop terrace were great of the acropolis.   Highly recommend hotel if willing to not be right next to acropolis, etc.\n",

Downsides are, it's used for lots of bus tours so it's very busy and breakfast can be a bun flight. While it is walking distance to the Plaka, there are less celubrious streets to walk down before getting there. Despite there being big advertising posters of food being served oin the downstairs brasserie, it is only at cvertain times with a very limited menu and food in the a la carte is very limited and very expensive and the cocktails are pretty poor too for the cost. In saying all that, this is a beautiful looking hotel and warrants it's 4 stars. It's a good location and reasionable quiet. I would stay again.\n",

The washroom really needs major upgrades as  a quick shower will quickly turn into a bath due to a poor drainage. This issue was brought up to the management but it was not resolved.

We had booked a hotel in Exarchia Square unaware of how unsafe the area was.

It was getting dark and we were terrified so we went into Titania when we passed it on the offchance they might have availability. They made space for us for both nights and ensured our safety. The front desk staff were incredibly helpful and reassuring which made us feel welcome and secure from the moment we entered the hotel. Our stay at this hotel only got better after this with kind staff at the bar when we got dinner and at breakfast with very good service. We are…\n",

      "Review is :Stayed at this hotel twice over our two week stay in Greece. The rooms are spacious as per European standards. Very clean and staff are very helpful. The walls are super thin so you will hear your neighbour. Our first stay the room was dated (on the fourth floor) and the same with the fifth floor. However, our one night stay on return to Athens we were put in very nice and updated rooms on the sixth floor. The hotel is in walking distance to may eating places and the main shopping district. The roof top view of the Acropolis is stunning. Breakfast was included with the room and you won't go hungry! Would stay here again on our next visit but will ask for a room on the sixth floor.\n",

The hotel we were trying to locate was in a particularly dangerous area and we were scared in an unfamiliar city at nightfall. The staff at the Titania kindly fitted the 7 of us into two rooms, even providing an extra bed for us in a twin room. They made sure we felt at ease and safe after our traumatic experience in Omonia square. I would definitely stay here again due to the kindness and accommodating nature of the staff at the Titania hotel. My friends and I are so grateful for their kind actions.\n",

That was done and we had a marvellous stay. Would rate it as a 5.  The second stay was the polar reverse. First we were put into an old smoking room, with three single beds and it STUNK of cigarette smoke. Just awful.

A group of us were getting ready to leave to go to the airport and we were sitting at tables eating food we had gotten from the plaka.  We were sitting there for 10 minutes with one of the employees sitting in the room next to us, and we were rudely interrupted and told we could take that food back to where we got it and eat it or we could go outside.

I also think their trip advisor reviews are fake.    I arrived to a standard room, which I immediately walked in and out of as it smelt musty, was dark and dingy and in need of modernisation- something out of the 70's. No double bed, but twin beds.  I complained and asked them to move me- they charged me 120 euro to upgrade to a 'superior' room. When entering this one although it was brighter, the bathroom was so small- you literally walked out of the bath into the sink and the balcony overlooked grafitti vandalised apartment blocks.

The rooms are adequate, but worn, and the beds not super comfortable. To be fair, though, they are in the process of remodelling from the top down, and some friends who moved rooms wound up in a new one that they said was nice.  But my room on the first floor was worn and a bit shabby.  The breakfast was very good, and offered a wide range of choices, so that's a highlight.  The problem was the hotel was also really busy with groups the whole time I was there, and also really loud until very late in the evenings.  I realise the hotel can't really control this, but it's a factor, too, in getting some reliable rest.\n",

      "Review is :As part of our two-week vacation in Greece, we stayed a total of five nights at Titania.   The hotel is nice, and is pretty centrally located. Our room was somewhat dated with a slow draining shower. It took me 3 days to figure out how to place the shower head without flooding the bathroom floor every time.  The bed was very clean and comfortable and we found our room to be located in a quiet area with very little noise.   The hotel  has three dining options. We recommend spending a bit more and enjoying some meals at the Olive Garden. Their staff are very attentive, the food is great and the view is amazing. We had our first dinner at the Olive Garden and enjoyed our last night in Athens with dinner there as well. Well worth the expense.   The staff was great and very prompt in…\n",

On a positive side,  I would like to mention the front desk, they guys are efficient, multilingual, attentive to your needs. We did not have to wait for check in, the room was ready early, however, if you are part of a large group you may have to wait to be checked in. Buffet breakfast was excellent, great variety of everything. they also serve continental breakfast starting at 4 am which is great if you have an early flight or ferry. The restaurant on the ground floor was ok, but nothing exciting. First time we got a room on the 3rd (smoking) floor. It was hard to breathe, impossible to get fresh air by opening a window…\n",

The rooftop has killer views and is great for a night out or if you just want to have a coffee.\n",

Best view of the Acropolis in Athens, and at night it is absolutely spectacular.  Even if you don't stay here, visit this special lounge at night - you wont be disappointed.

The first visit put us on the first floor of the hotel...and it was not a great experience. The room was exceptionally small (which is not unexpected in the city), and the bed was remarkably uncomfortable and lumpy. It felt as if we were sleeping on a lumpy cinderblock. The view was of other room windows and a portion of the roof of an area on the 0 floor. It was, however, very quiet and smoke free.   The second visit put us on the 7th floor....and right near the elevator. If you are assigned/receive any room ending in 05 or 06 (example: 706 or 705) you are situated right near the elevator. The elevators are not particularly loud until the early morning…\n",

One of the issues was mentioned in my previous report and that is the noise of dragging chairs on the level above. In my room on the 9th floor there was a felt underneath the legs of the chairs so maybe my complaint started bearing some fruit. The other complaint is the weak wifi. It was a nuisance trying ot upload a page on the internet as the browser would keep spinning. That happened during the entire stay. In this day and age where every hotel provides free wifi with acceptable speed, there is no reason why the Titania would not provide the same. Having said that, I will keep returning to…\n",

I was warned by several experienced travellers to Greece to be wary in that district.  The public spaces of the Omonia are generally very well decorated.  The rooftop Olive Garden restaurant and lounge is a great place to enjoy life.  The breakfast buffet is a typical Continental breakfast.  It was good, but not excellent.  The room itself is a bit shopworn since it serves both travellers and conference attendees.  There are three tiers, if you will, of rooms:  The rooms on the lower floors SERIOUSLY NEED RENEWAL.

When we arrived at our room, at 2:00am, we walked in and realized there was already another couple, undressed, and asleep in bed. We promptly closed the door, went back downstairs, informed the reception person, who repoed with \"Jesus Christ! Did they wake up? We might have to apologize to them!\"   Might? 🤔 hmm. I suspect they likely never said anything to this couple, who may never know another two people walked into their hotel in the middle of the night and saw them naked and asleep.   As far as our stay quality. We booked a king size bed, room for two, and were quoted one price. When we arrived we were met…\n",

It was fabulous, a view of the Acropolis and a fabulous sunset. The meal was second to none. The food , wine and outlook made the night so special. Our waiter was the best and we could not have ended our trip in a better location. The Hotel is great, the room was excellent and cleanliness excellent. Both the Hotel and the restaurant is highly recommended. It was special. Thank you.\n",

The rooms are spacious, functional and beautifully decorated. Cleanliness is impeccably meticulous and excellent sound insulation shuts out all the noise of the busy city. We were also pleasantly surprised to see that on our last night we were upgraded to a luxurious suite on the ninth floor with a breathtaking view to the Parthenon.

There appeared to be no decent restaurants nearby save the Titania's own \"Olive Garden\" (see above).  Also, the hotel missed two of three important wake-up calls, although they went out of their way to apologize and fix the problems these missed calls caused.\n",

The taracce was full of tourists ( most of them were probably staying at the hotel) and there were only 3 waiters to attand them. My friends and i got a fresh juice, and sangria that we paid very expensive for no reason!!  7,5 euros the orange juice and 6euros each sangria. Both Sangrias had 5 mini pieces of apples - practically was just wine- and got served with mixed nuts . Other tables were having dinner with nice looking plates but I personally would not viit it again not recommend  it to anyone.\n",

Unfortunately, among the so many thing that went under, the quality of the rooms was one of them. Although the images we see are of luxurious rooms, with ample space and fine furnishings, the reality was so much gummier. There was no wood surface undamaged, I imagine that a horror movie, or worst, took place there... the bathroom was small... but so small... gods... who designs these places. on the plus side, the staff was quite sympha. Love them. Hate the fact that internet in the room hat to be payed..  This was an experience from the 90's... at their very beginning. I'm sorry, but if you enjoy gracious rooms, a view, and not a totally damaged interior, you mustn't stay here...…\n",

Worst wifi ever, so don't plan on connecting your devices.  Location is great though. If you just want to sleep, it's a good location.  Rooms were super clean, and the housekeeping staff were on their game.  Each floor looked different though like some were updated and some were not.  Don't be fooled by the nice lobby.

Beside the hotel are two beautiful buildings, the national library and the academy which looks like the ancient temples.

In the city center for huge groups of tourists who go back and forth from all the destinations, Positive things are : the lobby which is sparkling and great, the olive tree Rooftop restaurant which offers a wonderfut view of the Acropolis (the food is average-quality greek food)  - Brasserie food and service are good. Here come the negatives notes: rooms are really tiny and small (we could barely move in the room) and really need to be refurbished - Bathroom very small too and no shower - old and ruined pieces of furnitures - Also very large groups of students arrive at night.  The hotel is very noisy all the day.  The food at breakfast time and at dinner was realy of poor quality. No fruits, Bread barely cooked, No choice…\n",

Its easier to walk to the hotel if you carry luggage by getting off at Panepistimio  station ,as it is down-slope and similarly take the metro from Omonia station as you leave the hotel. The hotel was good value for the money i payed (only 60 euro per day for a single room), in my case, since there was a discount at the time. Clean room with a comfortable bed , safe-box  etc. The view in my case was  at the back facing the back of another building but that did not bother me because when i travel i only stay in the room minimum time necessary. Besides, single rooms are never given the best location  in hotels. The breakfast included everything one could imagine. The 4 stars i gave because they…\n",

The lobby was stunning and had air conditioning, so as soon as you walked through the door you were instantly cooled down. The rooms were simple but clean and well maintained and the bathroom was great. The breakfast was super, a huge selection with coffee, tea, juices, breads, nuts, fruit, cheeses, cooked breakfast, meat and so much more! We filled up on it every morning so we didn't even need lunch! The roof top bar was incredible, with a great view of the Acropolis! Over all our stay was great and we will be returning here again!\n",

We initially thought our travel agent had done well by booking us there,  that was until we saw the upstairs corridors and the rooms.   The carpet in the halls has definitely seen better days, also the ceilings in the hallways all seem very low with dim lighting.  We had adjoining rooms with friends and shared the bathroom. For some strange reason both rooms had single beds.   A couple of nights before we left the aircon started leaking and one of the ceiling tiles got soggy and collapsed.   To their credit the hotel staff responded to our phone call at 10.30pm about the issue and within minutes arrived with towels to soak up the water. The leak was (almost) fixed the next day…\n",

There are also conveniently two or three kiosks right outside if you fancy a late night snack or want a magazine to flip through.  The view is nothing to speak of but it is a good trade off for being right in the city.  The best part in my opinion were the dinner buffet and the breakfast buffet.  There were so many different choices; it was overwhelming.  And the food was tasty.  The only downside was that the dining area was quite crowded and there were often lines for the buffet, but I'd still stay here again.\n",

Kollonaki, Monastiraki, Acropolis, Ermou, Syntagma...  The only downside was that my mothers room smelt very very bad, like a sewage pipe had broken in there but we dont know what the cause was... so bad that we had to request another room.  Finally at the end of the day they were moved into another room, but it is very curious as to why that particular room smelt bad.  Mine and my daughters room was fine.

There is no free WiFi in the rooms though you can purchase it for 4.50euro/h, or 12euro/day, both outrageously expensive.

Booking directly through the hotel website, we got a high rate for the one night that we stayed there although all the nights before and after that were half-price. When I called the hotel to inquire, they said that is how the computer assesses the fees based on availability. Five bus loads of tour groups showed up that one night we were there. It is an OK hotel for about 100-120 Euros per night per room, but definitely not for more.  Breakfast was terrible. Full of bus loads of tour groups and bad food.

The air conditioning in our room barely worked and the room had few if any amenities.  The area around the hotel is safe but dingy.  Graffiti on many on many of the buildings and this is the only hotel in the area.  Its a only a five minute walk to the metro and the staff was nice.  If its cheap, its a fine place to stay but don't be deceived by the fours star rating.  The lobby is nice but the rooms are the equivalent of a Super 8 in the United States and below that of an Ibis in Europe. Free internet only the lobby and it was very slow.  Even paid internet was slow.  The breakfast was nice, with a wide variety of items.\n",

Hotel staff are great and happy to assist when asked. Registration was quick and professional. Taxi stand is just steps outside the entrance and drivers are very professional and courteous. Our room rate included breakfast which was delicious and very filling. This hotel is among the best we have stayed in central Athens and we highly recommend it. Cons were lack of free wifi in rooms although it is free in the lobby. Prices for coffee and other refreshments in the lobby are very pricy!!\n",

The hotel has a lovely and spacious lobby with a nice coffee and bar set up.  The hotel breakfast offered lots of variety. The roof garden offers a magnificent view of the Acropolis and at night, delightful.  I would suggest making reservations for that restaurant since the choice seats fill up. The staff was great.

After unpacking and checking emails the air conditioning started having a loud noise. I played with the thermostat and was able to control the noise.  When I called Reception to ask for a wake-up call I noticed that the telephone had a lot of noise and interferrance. The next day I asked for a change and was moved without hesitation.

The opulence of the lobby transitioned, through the tiniest elevator, to an incredibly dated hotel. The telephone in our room didn't work so we had to use the one in the bathroom to callee lobby and receive our wakeup calls. The food was sub-par when compared to what we had in other hotels and now that I have had free WiFi in other hotels and restaurants I have visited during my stay, I find it alarming that this hotel made us pay (for weak WiFi). The only saving grace is the breathtaking views from the rooftop restaurant, and even that doesn't entirely make up for the disappointing rooms and rude staff.\n",

First of all the young girl at the Reception was arrogant and very unhelpful, baggage help it seems is only available if you ask for it. No information is given at all. So we trudge up to the lift and that is when the truth is revealed. The lift is slow and old and opens up on the 6th floor and it seems that you have stepped in to another hotel, dingy, outdated with a horrible musty smell.

Paying for WiFi on your room is a no go in these times and the payed WiFi could be not as fast as advertised (like the tv). The rooftop terrace is great but what is with this smoking allowed?

It has roof top restaurant and bar from which you can enjoy views over Acropolis of Athens and the whole city of Athens (amazing in the evening). Hotel lobby is nice. Breakfast is OK, good variety of food. Staff - ladies are polite and always with a smile, gentleman at the roof top restaurant polite and with a smile, everyone else look as if they hate their job (older guy at the reception especially - did not want to bother with any further request except to give key and that is all you can expect from him). Standard rooms are low quality ( 2 or 3 star quality rooms) but I must say that the room was very well cleaned every day. Corridors are old, rugs in the corridors are dirty and rooms…\n",

Me and my colleague were given a very small room which smelled of cigarette smoke and was rather outdated. The bed was comfortable but I found little insects running around the bathroom twice. Breakfast was decent. Wifi is only free in the lobby and costs a small fortune if you want to use it in your room  (12 Euro per 24h and you can only connect  2 devices).  On the second day my colleagues pyjamas had disappeared from her bed and were nowhere to be found. We assumed that they got accidentally taken away when the sheets were changed so she went to ask the staff in the lobby about it. They promised to call the laundry the next day (as it was closed…\n",

I dont usually take my car as I dont want to worry about traffic and parking spots, especially when I find myself downtown. To my surprise there is a huge garage where you can park your vehicle. Also, the hotel provides almost everything, the buffet is full of delish foods to be served and the breakfast was satisfying as well. Hot water anytime of the day i needed, very quite despite hotel's location and very friendly staff. I was satisfied from my staying there.\n",

First, the good points. The hotel is in a great location. It has a wonderful staff, and nice amenities. Big towels, even. The rooftop restaurant has views that any hotel would envy. A couple of decades ago, the rooms were likely great. That was then.  Now, the bad. It’s falling apart. The room needed a lot of work. My room also had a commanding view of the vacant, crumbling building across the street. The room had no carpet and little insulation, so the walls are thin. The ceiling is thin. Sound travels. I think the people above me enjoyed moving furniture until about midnight. The shower was handheld.…\n",

As for location, it is in a hustling and bustling part of the city, but kind of far from the Main attractions. About a 10-15 minute walk to the Placa, which is where you'll want to spend a majority of your time. Taxi rides were extremely cheap however…\n",

      "Review is :We arrived to Athens in the morning and were staying less than 24 hours before taking the ferry to Mykonos. The hotel lobby looks very nice, and grander than the actual rooms. Wi-fi only works in the main lobby, not in the room. The room was clean. Outdated fixtures and the bathroom was 'OK'. Nothing fancy, but suitable for a one night stay. We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant - the view there is absolutely lovely. you can see the acropolis and it is romantic to see the sunset. Would recommend staying there for a very short stay: clean and economical.\n",

The new roof-top Olive Restaurant and bar is worth a pop in if you stay but apart from that its a tour operator style hotel with tour buses waiting to disgorge their tourists or take them away. Not a personal hotel in the least\n",

      "Review is :This was the first hotel during our 9 day 3 island honeymoon and right off the bat it appeared to me that Greece had some phobia about irons. When I called the front desk requesting an iron, I was told the iron was on the 7th floor(my room was 803) across from room 701. As if this didnt seem odd enough, when I went to the 7th floor across from room 701, it was a service corridor with an ironing board and an iron that was chained to the wall so it couldnt be removed. I was in absolute SHOCK!! ! Any time that I needed something ironed I had to bring my clothes to the 7th floor and iron it in some secluded service corridor. All I could think was what if multiple people on my floor or any other floor for that matter need to iron at the same time? The room was ok, a bit dated but as…\n",

Rooms are not too bad, can get a pretty decent stay, but don't expect anything above a three-star.  Beds are not very comfortable one pillow.  Breakfast is the main dining room is pretty good, plenty of selections, clean.  Rooftop Restaurant is really nice, food is good, service is excellent, staff very friendly, attentive, and the views are amazing.  So if you need to just crash for a day or two great, but if you're looking for something along the lines of a Marriott or Hilton, bypass it.\n",

      "Review is :I stayed at the Titania during a conference in July 2015. The hotel is supposedly a luxury hotel located on a main artery of this vibrant colorful city. Reviews tended to be negative, addressing lack of service oriented attitude from staff, shabby looking rooms and unpleasant neighborhood bordering on unsafe.  I stayed for 4 nights, in a single room. My impression was that this is a nice enough hotel, the rooms were obviously not shining new but they were in order and clean. Service was good and attentive. Location was excellent and if this is not Athens' best neighborhood, we could not notice it and we went out every evening to eat or walk about the neighborhood - and felt totally safe.   The hotel is good value and well located also in terms of public transportation. To sum it…\n",

Definitely it not deserves the 4 stars that some blind eyed inspector of the Ellenic tourism office gave it, as for a lot of them here in Greece. So if you are one of a tourist group, your are sacked and you have only relax and to stay away from your hotel room the most of the time you'll spend in this wonderful Athens. Rooms are old with dollhouse bathrooms, walls are so thin that you can hear your fellow-sufferer when it takes a shower or other, moreover a lot of them are stinking  of smoke even if it is a no smoking hotel.

The staff is friendly and helpful, promptly getting a room for our early arrival and making photocopies of our lost luggage paperwork. The rooms, however, are somewhat small, with almost no amenities and beds (two singles pushed together to make a double) which are not particularly comfortable. Our room overlooked a not picturesque air shaft. For the price, $350 in a country with a crashed economy, you can probably do better, but it was fine for one night.\n",

Breakfast area was ok but chairs were dirty and breakfast was not the best!  Even though they had a large selection the stations were always left empty-maybe because of the crowd of people.

I believe there was some renovation going on (no noise pollution at all by the way) so we hope the rooms will look better in future because the hotel lobby looked really posh. Room was great even though it looks slightly old-fashion but the air con works really well, especially important during the summer!

Had I searched for a hotel myself then I probably would have chosen a hotel somewhere in Syntagma or Plaka area which are the main shopping & nightlife districts in Athens and are close to the historical sights.  The bathroom in my rooms was very small actually tiny! I could hardly open the door & get in it.  The shower power was not that great too!  Didn't much care for the breakfast buffet after my first morning.  Choose to have it later outside.  Otherwise staff seemed helpful & generally just fine.\n",

In the heart of Athens. Great lobby and food. The downside is the Internet connection is shaky and rooms can get a face lift. The staff was very nice and helpful. Korina, gust relations, was very nice and helpful in finding information about Mykonos and Santorini for us. She was very sincere in trying to help us any way possible.

I won't say I was pleasantly surprised — the hotel really is not so hot — but it also wasn't terrible either.  My room on the 5th floor was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The room had clearly seen years and years of use, with chips in the furniture, stains of one sort or another on some of the walls, and a bathroom that wasn't in the most pristine of conditions.  But it was clearly clean, everything did work, and as a place where I spent most of my time sleeping, it was not offensive.  Some reviewers have talked about unpleasant smells and the like.  I didn't have that experience at all.  The breakfast offers a huge amount…\n",

The lobby is very nice,made with expensive marble, but once getting to the room floors it becomes a very different and depressing story with worn, faded carpets on the floors. The rooms are basic,dated and drab with worn furniture and to say its a luxury hotel is a complete misrepresentation. Their idea of a double room is 2 single beds pushed together with separate bedding. Also the walls are thin and we were kept awake with noise from other rooms. I would rate this hotel as a 2 star tourist hotel with a 4 star lobby and prices. We did think the breakfast was quite good and perhaps the best point. Wi-fi is free in the lobby but expensive in the room.\n",

The first room given to us smelt terribly as the bathroom had no window and doubt the extractor worked, we were then given another room once we complained. The shower head hook is placed halfway, so unless you a child, you can’t really shower.

Rooms aren't that great,  however the WiFi, good lobby and awesome service make it a hotel worth staying.\n",

The lobby is wonderful and has wireless, and the Olive Garden restaurant on the top floor has a killer view of the Acropolis. The restaurant is great but under-utilized; everyone goes to the bar. The breakfast buffet is full of feral high school and college students, so you need to be ready for that. On two mornings, we could not find a place to sit.  Our room was very small, but we hardly spent any time in it given that Athens is such a wonderful city. The staff were very accommodating, and overall I would recommend this hotel\n",

The location is the main attraction for this hotel. I was on 4-day business trip to the city and of course I have been in the city before. The rooms are nicely laid but it would be helpful if you have the room with a view of the parthenon, acropolis. The hill looks attractive at nite especially if you dine on the roof top restaurant at the hotel where you can have a nicely laid view. The hotel breakfast is very good if you like all those full continental stuff. I prefer the cereals and the fresh fruits.

I found the front desk staff to be very helpful.  The location is good- you can walk to the Plaka, Acropolis, Ermou St., Syntagma Square...all the tourist hot-spots.  The Omonia Metro station is close by if you want to catch the metro.  Athens has a great metro system.\n",

When the car stopped near the hotel, It was very impressive, but  later we found the rooms less impressive' clean but not modern at all. The executive rooms are better than the standard rooms but nothing special to write home.  The Inter-net connection in the rooms is very expansive, and today it is not clear why, when in other hotels and restaurants it is free of charge.  The view from the roof is very very nice, breakfast is very good - every one can find fresh and tasty food according to his taste.

Big enough when you walk in but narrows to a tight area around the toilet at the far end.  And its surrounded by towels hanging over you, a phone and the TP dispenser on the sides.  Shower head is on long wall of tub facing the tub opening.  Only hotel I've stayed in Greece so is this typical of Greece? Elevators were also strange.  Said for 900kg but would sometimes sound the alarm after only 4 people on board.  Other times 10 people would squeeze in there.  Minor unless you're in a rush.\n",

There is an Internet cafe close by but it won't be easy to post pictures that way.   My advice is use a hotel that provides wifi on better terms. Maybe all Athens hotels are like this one, but I will look long and hard before settling for this rigmarole again.

The hotel is tired,  rooms were dark because all windows faced a wall, bathrooms were old, small, showers did not work, tubs were small, walls were in need of paint and repair.  But the worst was the food on the 2nd floor (buffet style) and dinners particularly.  The meat dishes were unreconizable, I called it mystery meat, fatty meat swimming in sauces, limited choices, over cooked pastas, vegetables, slow with keeping the food trays stocked.  I am not a great lover of buffets and this by far was the worst I have…\n",

You would wait a long time for the elevators, quicker to walk up six flights of steps.  Reception staff rude and unwelcoming.  And definitely overpriced for the low standard of accommodation.

We were too tired to ask for a room change the first night, and were only there for two nights, so didn't bother.  We expected more from a 4* hotel.  Some of the staff were very helpful, some not.  We had a sandwich in the lobby café, which was pretty bad, so didn't try anything else.  Breakfast was OK, and they did provide a very early breakfast for a small group of us on the 24th.\n",

There is a small bar in the lobby, but the main one is on the rooftop and is called Olive Garden. And no, it's not THAT Olive Garden. It's a white tablecloth, upscale restaurant that looks directly at the Parthenon. Having a drink while looking at the Parthenon lit up against the night is a great experience.  There is a hop-on, hop-off bus tour stop that's only about a two block walk from the hotel. We used that and liked it. Plus, you don't have to deal with Athens' cabdrivers.\n",

It really needs an upgrade. The staff weren't as helpful or polite and the wifi is just ridiculous. Free wifi for 60 minutes continuos and only in the public areas of the hotel. The only good thing was the fact it was located on the main road so to get to the main attractions it was just a straight road to walk. I didn't enjoy my experience here and I am sure I got bitten many times in the hotel. Wasn't the best of hotels but if it is a 3*, I suppose it is what it is.\n",

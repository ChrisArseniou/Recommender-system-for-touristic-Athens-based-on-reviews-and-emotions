Cons: restaurant was overpriced and service was underwhelming.  The location of the hotel felt like it was in a seedy area of town with lots of obvious \"exotic\" night clubs all over the place. Nonetheless, it is a walkable distance from restaurants and shopping areas (about a mile). A short, 10 minute taxi ride for about 6-8 euros will also get you to most tourist areas of the city.\n",

Downstairs food better than rooftop.   Spa area and indoor pool is awesome.   Careful with room reservation.

Tried several times to call the operator, housekeeping services, and room service - no answer.  Eventually went downstairs and talked to the front desk about the problem.  They said \"Maintenance\" would be there shortly.  After an hour - no maintenance.  Went back down - did this cycle 3 times.  Finally called their \"emergency\" number and was told the heat was not turned on, but they were happy to send up extra blankets.  To crown it all - we decided that a hot shower would take the edge off, but to our shock, there was no hot water - so were in a very cold room - took a cold shower and tried to warm up in bed.  We were there for 3 days and \"Maintenance\" never showed up.  The room remained cold - only plus, we had hot water the remaining days.  Not only was the heating not working, the people we talked to didn't seem to understand how uncomfortable we were.  I would not go there again.…\n",

Also the toster is very slow, please change it. All hotels have rotating ones it’s better and faster, seen POP up toster first time in hotel, it seems like it’s purposely done to waist time.

We spent 12 nights in an Acropolis View Grand Suite.  From check in to the housekeeping staff, all were professional and caring.  Again, beyond expectations.  High, high praise goes to the Club staff and to those at The Grand on 8th floor.  We ate many meals in either the Club or The Grand, which had a nice variety, even for a lengthy stay.  It is impossible to name by name, but Stefanios (?) in the Club, George, Demitri, and Natalie in The Grand as well as Anton and Angela in both venues went out of their way to help us have a happy vacation.

The staff were always able to locate taxis for us quickly and it was a quick 5 euro taxi to the center. This is a lovely Grand Hyatt and the breakfast buffet was extensive and we were able to skip lunch everyday because it was so large. Dinner in the restaurant was very nice as well. Every member of the staff that we interacted with was so polite and helpful. The indoor and outdoor pools were both amazing.\n",

The promised Acropolis view from our bedroom window (room 382) was almost laughable. It was in the far corner…..just … almost obliterated by the HUGE red neon sign on the side of the next door building that lit up our entire room from dusk til dawn. There were absolutely no helpful notes at all about the room functionality or tourist tips either. We couldn’t get the Air Con to work - no notes to help us - and when we asked a maid - she shrugged and just pointed to a unit on the wall.  We struggled for ages and gave up. In the end I rang reception - who told me there was a button on the top of the unit to press. If you’re a seasoned…\n",

Just back from a 5-day visit. There is still some work going on where they are finalizing the roof top facilities. Should be super when finished.

The carpets are stained, the pictures are bent and damaged and the floors are uneven. The room was dusty and the breakfast almost inedible.

It's about a 1 hour subway/bus ride to the hotel from the airport, easily funded by buying a 20 euro unlimited 3 day Metro pass. Also an easy 10 - 15 minute bus ride to the Acropolis attractions, with a bus stop 100 yards away. We arrived about 11:00 am, checked in, but had to store our luggage and come back after 3:00 pm to get a room assignment, as they were fully booked. Chose a room on the backside after being assured it would be quieter (and it was). Didn't try the restaurant or pools. Only demerit was for the long and lengthy check in.

The roof top pool area was nice for an evening drink at sunset but in the day seemed full of influencers getting the perfect picture.

The facilities are exceptional, the rooms are perfect and to top it off the staff are very efficient and professional.    Luxury Awaits!\n",

The restaurant does have views over the Acropolis on one side and at the pool. It is a slightly longer walk to the Metro Station if you are using this otherwise Taxis are plentiful at the hotel. All the main sites are in an easy reach from the Hotel. All the facilities we used were very well maintained as we have come to expect from the Hyatt Group. All in all it was a relaxing few days and I would highly recommend the Grand Hyatt when visiting Athens\n",

Our bedroom 646 was great, a bit snug with 3 adults sharing, but ok. Our room appeared recently renovated, but the poor shower design meant that water went everywhere, clearly the bathroom door was becoming quite damaged and this was going through to the wooden floor in the bedroom too. The hotel is quite far from the nightlife, so we have had to spent a lot on taxis whilst going out at night. The roof pool was lovely, but quite small, we tried the pool on the first floor because the roof was full, again this lacked in space but worst of all, I stepped on the grass and ended up ankle deep in mud.\n",

Instead the more expensive rooms offer a straight view to gray old ugly blocks, a autobahn and severel strip-clubs. There was unfortunately no wifi in our room. The problem was solved only after various complains 24 hours later. The technicians had no feeling for privacy ignoring the \"do not disturb\" sign and entering the room without notification in advance. The prices for food and drinks at the hotel have nothing to do with prices in the area. All in all a rather disappointing experience.…\n",

Breakfast is generous, with enough capacity to seat cruise ship groups, and despite getting busy and loud (as I have tinnitus) they never seem to run short of food. The quality is fairly standard for a business hotel, with some Greek flair, the yoghurt, honey and orange juice are sublime.   The gym is good and the rooftop bar is smaller than expected but the view is wonderful and the evening vibe is lovely.

However, we wanted to make the most of our 16 or so hours there. Michael, the Guest Relations Manager, made that happen for us.  First, we had a suite (using a Hyatt Globalist upgrade), which was, even by American standards, huge. Michael also set up a fantastic private guide for us at the Acropolis (ask for Eleni if you get the chance) and arranged very affordable airport transfers. Even though we were there for less than 24 hours, we were made to feel like special guests.  On the down side, the property is not in a very appealing neighborhood, but all the places you'd want to go are a short cab ride away.\n",

At lobby level to the far left,there's a club lounge with evening light food and drinks and all day non alcoholic beverages  We had access due to our suite but it's a globalist perk usually I think It's a relaxing spot to unwind after your day or indeed conduct some…\n",

Speeding traffic all night kept us awake and we had a side room… We were also allocated a disabled access room which added a new dimension to the wet room concept.  Room was clean and typical of a large hotel chain The light switches were a mystery…no idea why hotels have to make lighting such an issue. Why the bathroom light switch was not at the bathroom door baffled us.  Breakfast was OK…too busy and noisy for us. Would not recommend this place. Walking outside is difficult due to the main road as crossing it is limited and negotiating the intersections is life threatening\n",

Staff is largely well trained and polite and the pools were a great opportunity to cool off after a long day.  One of the highlights is the buffet breakfast, and the views from the upstairs restaurant. Do not miss! The dinner at Interni was also excellent, but you’d probably pay double something like Naïf just across the street.

Especially liked the view of the Acropolis everytime we walked to the elevator . Stayed at Hyatt because it had a gym but it offered a lot more. Pretty easy to get to and from tourist spots, though not in the heart of one.\n",

Not walking distance from most places you’d like to be. You are near a very busy freeway and strip clubs. They do have a shuttle to the main area downtown, but it’s much nicer to be able to just walk there. Also the food could be improved. The breakfast was heavy on pastries, and cakes, and was not as European as what we had experienced at other hotels. The fruit and veggies were not as fresh and somewhat lower quality. We spent most our days in Athens at a different smaller hotel that was centrally located. It was more authentic Greek and less American (which we preferred). This smaller hotel was older, had no pool, and wasn’t as modernized but we…\n",

The rooms are well proportioned with a nice decor. The extra charge for the coffee machine pods is unusual in a higher end hotel.  Unfortunately booking is required to use the indoor pool which is frustrating as it means you can’t use the facility when you wish and might have to wait a day or two to get a booking which detracts from the luxury of the hotel or your other plans.  The upstairs pool although heated is often closed too if the weather is inclement which means we didn’t get to use it either.

While it is not guaranteed, another couple, my husband and I waited in the lobby for 5-6 hrs as we watched countless others check-in. The other couple was expecting.  While waiting for 5-6 hrs, we were overlooked for over 20 minutes by the waiter in the lobby restaurant.  We only received service after going to the bar 3 times. When we finally received service, I received a cappuccino instead of the tea I requested.  Adding to this was many patrons seated after us, received service before us.   The hotel is a 20 -30 min walk from restaurants/attractions. As mentioned in a previous review, taxi drivers are not eager to take you back to the hotel, so keep that in mind.  …\n",

We were not made aware that the hotel is undergoing construction works. On holiday, catching up on sleep is one thing I personally enjoy, but was woken up at 7:30am every morning by drilling. Not the best way to relax and the reason why I give them 4 stars instead of 5 stars. One of the days, we had a terrible smell of the burn from welding iron from  fill the breakfast room and the infinity pool had a disrupted view of a crane disturbing the view of the Acropolis while works were taking place next to the infinity pool. It would have been good to manage out expectations ahead of booking that works were taking place.   That said, the service made up for all of these…\n",

I believe Hyatt has bought this one from Radisson a few years ago. Improved it. Now they are adding a huge over 200 room addition which will make this the largest property in Athens.

With impressive facilities (swimming pools, restaurant, bar and fitness center), a welcoming staff and a location close to the city center*, I couldn’t have asked for a better set-up to enjoy my first Greek experience. Where I was let down however was with the sound proofing of the room. This has always been my number one criteria when traveling and unfortunately, found myself hearing each car passing by one of Athens main arteries (where the hotel is located).  Other than that, I would definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt in Athens. *Heads-up on location! The hotel is a near a number of strip clubs and streets leading to downtown…\n",

They did a good job with Globalist recognition and gave a nice suite upgrade and a generous f & b allowance in lieu of the lounge, which is currently closed.  The suite was not very large, but was comfortable and well appointed.  No bathtub, which was disappointing.  Comfortable bed and bedding.  There was a constant bubbling/boiling sound in the walls, some issue with the heat or plumbing?  Not loud enough to keep you awake but pretty annoying.

Only downside is no club lounge - Hyatt provided a 20 euro per guest daily room credit as compensation and we had to eat breakfast in the loud, crowded main restaurant buffet style.

Absurdly, the shower room lacks a shelf to place soap and shampoo bottles on it (which must be placed on the floor). The bags for sanitary napkins are missing.   There is no shelf suitable for placing suitcases if not on the floor.

There were two things I didn't love which were the pillows which had no support and basically didn't do anything other than compress when you put your head or back onto them, and the noise from the road which despite some obvious soundproofing (and there was, don't get me wrong) was still audible at night.

A BIG constructions site is right next door, which Hyatt mentions nowhere in advance. Noise Monday-Saturday 7am-2pm -The hotel: big! And the pools (one ground floor and and one roof top) are too small (esp. the rooftop). Hotel is mainly used by huge groups (e.g. cruise ships or similar) -The rooms: Spacious, but slightly outdated.

Some reviews have mentioned the location and the presence of strip clubs- the location is in a business district where corporations have their offices. There are 2-3 strip clubs on the Main Street but that is it. This is not a red light district.

We stayed the first night and canceled the other booking and we stayed in another hotel for the last two nights in Greece for us.   The hotel is okay! But the location is really bad. Staff were nice and welcomed but unfortunately the location was so bad for visitors as u are unable to go anywhere for walk as we didn’t feel safe at this area and had to take taxis and they were working us all the time regarding money.  The room is not the best for five stars and to be honest we were disappointed with it. Breakfast wasn’t good too so we decided not to eat there but outside.\n",

Had to queue for a breakfast, service was all over the place and rushed, the view is over the city not the Acropolis - in all very disappointing. My wife was splashed in mud due to the sprinkler system by the pool apparently being broken - really unpleasant. The hotel is in a down-market part of Athens. I definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel.

I would certainly give it 5 stars for the hotel. However, I wouldn’t say it was centrally located.  There is a shuttle every hour, which takes you to where the tourist attractions and streets lined with bars and cafes but the last one is at 6pm. It’s a bit far too walk. Taxis don’t really take you as they don’t think it’s far enough for them. We got charged 5 euros sometimes or 20 euros other times. It was a bit of a lottery.  Next time I’d prefer to stay in a hotel closer to the centre as it was frustrating having to get taxis all the time.\n",

Erm…..? There are many better hotels in the centre of town for views etc if that’s what you’re looking for… roof top bar was packed with the ‘shiny’ tanning gang and limited spaces on rooftop and lower floor pool. Noisy rooms, sound of traffic can be heard on Acropolis facing rooms. Didn’t bother us, but could affect others. However, good location for bus stop (hop on, hop off) good breakfast….

From everywhere in the hotel you can hear the construction.  On the roof by the pool and also in the room when everything is closed. Also, its not close to the main area of the city, and not close to the beach.  Also, no coffee maker in the room.\n",

      "Review is :The most disappointing hotel stay ever. We booked this hotel on the basis of the rooftop pool and a central location with rooms offering views of the Acropolis. We had never been to Athens and only staying one night so wanted a lovely experience. IT could not have been worse. The check in and luggage staff were very nice but the deluxe room with Acropolis view was very lacking. The view is from the balcony not the room and even standing outside on small balcony then it is just of the rock peeping above many buildings. Terrible. Even worse is the fact the hotel located next to a major ten lane motorway so not nice to stand on balcony. Traffic noise heard all through the night. There are three strip clubs opposite too so its not a good area and I wouldn't feel safe walking around…\n",

The location may put some people off but it is only a 5 Euros taxi fare to Syntagna Square and - for the more energetic - a 30/40 minute walk to the Acropolis.

Although bathrooms don't have bathtubs, they have Balmain toiletries, that smell really nice. The breakfast buffet was tasty and compliant with covid19 measures: guests queue up and someone from the staff serves whatever you select. They also bring you coffee and tea to your table. I was given a room facing the Acropolis and the street, which could be quite noisy when the balcony door was open, but very silent when it was shut, so I had not issues to sleep. I have…\n",

But I doubt wether I will ever again book a Hyatt in Europe. I have to admit that we received a significant upgrade for the room, which was consequently significantly larger than needed.

Breakfast was delicious and Panayiotis and everyone in the team were super friendly and wonderful with our 8 year old. The pool was super well taken care off with all sun loungers being disinfected after every use and all tables and chairs being sanitised too. The food at the restaurant never failed to disappoint. We have had four meals all of which were delicious. Finally  the staff at the front desk were always super eager to assist with our daily requests. A must place to stay when visiting Athens!\n",

The lines were long but it was due to the Covid limitations. The waiting staff was very helpful and always following the rules related to Covid. All the time in gloves and wearing a face covering. The distance of the hotel from the city center is a bit far but doable by taxi. The parliament is about 5 mins and 5 euro away (although the price sometimes reached 7 euros depending on the driver’s interpretation of the fare). Would come back!!\n",

Unfortunately some rules aren’t really logic, but the employees can’t change them: no coffee machine in rooms, club lounge closed (you get a credit of €20 per day and person) - not really satisfying if you book a room with club lounge. Thanks Giorgos for your support. Breakfast team was amazing and managed well & with happiness the crowded situation.\n",

Location: Not in the immediate centre (but only €4-5 in a cab to get to the more central areas), which means you get a bigger hotel with more amenities (like 2 pools, big rooms etc.)  It's Covid times so you have to make allowances, like the queue for breakfast.  I don't know how full the hotel was, but I presume as it was August 2020 it wasn't near capacity, and even still we never managed to get a bed by the roof pool. And didn't always manage to get a bed in the sun by the first floor pool. So think it would be a struggle at peak times.  All in all, would definitely stay again.\n",

Restaurant is good (i had one diner and one lunch), a bit pricey. Breakfast need to be improved (i suppose covid made the process a bit more complicated for buffet), but definitely not 5 stars.  Room could have been cleaner (bed wasn't perfectly made). No welcome drink or so. Mini bar was empty. Internet connexion is ok. Ive tried the atrium pool, that was clean with a bit of shadow.

We stayed for a week, on the first night we were kept awake by the sound of the pool pumps ( we stay in a rural area at home, so struggle with any noise) . We phoned reception who promptly turned off the pumps and offered to move us the next day. We took them up on the offer and they moved our cases for us.   Reception are excellent, they gave us lots of advice with restaurants and beaches etc.   We were never able to get a lounger at the rooftop pool but we always did at the atrium pool which was lovely and relaxed. One suggestion for the hotel would be to put tiles or AstroTurf down instead of the sunloungers lying on the grass as it was at times muddy and I almost slipped…\n",

We arrived and the two rooms we had booked had been upgraded, a bottle of wine in each, view of the Parthenon in one. Lovely. Reduced rate for guests at breakfast, staff served us from the buffet but the system worked. No tea and coffee facilities in the room because of COVID but could live without it and no room servicing on two night stay unless requested, we could also live without that. No lounge either. Staff were lovely. We felt totally COVID safe. Thank you. The only downside is the location. We did walk into the centre of Athens but there’s no popping back as it’s just to far especially in the heat.\n",

Only two small drawers to store things, inadequate hangers (4 wooden and 3 of those padded ones).  Mildew all over the shower floor so it’s flipflops the whole time.  Pillows seem to be made from air and offer zero support.  Nothing in the rooms is reflective of the premium price.   Pool areas are a disaster.  The rooftop one has only a handful of sunbeds.

I never dreamt I would have my feet up on the balcony over looking a ten lane motorway overlooking strip clubs which are plentiful in this area.

There was no priority check-inexperienced and was poorly greeted by a lady with a sour attitude and was made to listen to a rather long scripted list details about the hotel. She didnt seem happy to be working there and it made me very uncomfortable. I was surprised that my wife and I had to wait for the room to be 'touched -up'; despite us arriving at 4:30pm.

This hotel is located right on a major 10 lane road, so there’s tons of noise/pollution if you want to open the window or even lie by the pool. Oh and it’s in the sex club neighbourhood ( our room overlooked “Kinky Opera”) which will appeal to some but makes walking around undesirable.   I paid to upgrade to an Acropolis view suite; turns out these are directly under the pool and all you can hear is the pool noise above you (or motorway if you go on your balcony).

Leonidas at the front desk was exceptionally helpful as were all the staff!  Room service and food were great as well.

Had to wait 20 mins before someone showed up to open the door between connecting rooms 2. Only 1 hand towel and 1 face towel per room (we were 2 guests per room) 3. Used towels were not replaced 4. Small bottle of water free for 1st day but no refills (not nice especially during hot summer) 5. Coffee machine available but they charge you EUR 3 for a capsule.  6.

But, when we checked in to the room, I could not see the Acropolis, and said this to the bellman. He said it definitely was an \"Acropolis view room\" but you had to step on the balcony to see it. Which I did.   From the balcony, in the far off distance you can see the Parthenon, but that's it because we are on the 3rd floor, and you would have to be on one of the higher floors to see anything else in the Acropolis. Worse, it is so far away that if I extend my arm, I can block out the entire Parthenon with only the last joint of my thumb. Attached is a photo from our balcony. Can you see the Parthenon?  Even worse,…\n",

There were many local delights, too, like Halvas-sesame dessert, spoon sweets etc. The location is very good, if you have a car or you would like to use a taxi.

The hotel has a fantastic roof-top bar/ restaurant and swimming pool area with great views out over the city to the Acropolis. The quality of the food is excellent - I can certainly recommend the club sandwich. Although the hotel is not in the center of the city - it is only a 5-10 minute taxi ride to the main tourist attractions. It is however located on a main road and there is not much to see or do near the hotel. Overall we had a very nice stay at the Hyatt.\n",

When we got to our room, we were not provided with a mat for the floor outside of the shower. When we called after…\n",

      "Review is :The hotel is nicely located in the outskirt of the city hustle-bustle. Rooms are nice and staff are friendly. I was there to attend a 3 days meeting and a part of the organizing team. The meeting rooms were bit small compared to luxury hotels in India. The common problem that I have seen in many rooms (we have taken around 30 plus rooms) is with housekeeping which can be improved, for example the bathroom doors do not lock properly with many rooms. I loved the rooftop pool, it must be the best I have ever seen till the date. Th breakfast options were also wonderful. The part that I can not miss about the hotel is the Concierge staff (special mention Giorgos-Guest Relations Manager) who helped a lot to the tourists to arrange for the local trips and letting us know all the best…\n",

Wait staff in the evenings at poolside are also very efficient and courteous. Staff at breakfast level seemed harassed and every morning trying to get a table is a nightmare due to procedural inefficiency. Waiting time can be 10 minutes or more. Housekeeping standards dismal. Had to call for towels and chambermaids cannot speak English. Two bottles of drinking water provided only on the first day of stay. I have traveled to more than 150 countries and have never encountered this. After the first day, you want water? You are on your own!

The decor was average. We were in a non-view room the first night, and were upgraded to an Acropolis view room the next day that would have otherwise cost an extra US$70. Believe me, don't waste your money. The Acropolis could be seen in a great distance if you stand by the window and look to the right.   We had breakfast every morning at the hotel. The separate area for Hyatt members was nice, but the service was not so good. The waiter on June 10 was horrible; he had an attitude when I asked for another cup of coffee.

Decoration of the room is elegant but unfortunately many elements were broken here and there (bedside lamp, curtain, AC didn't cool down, one of the pillow smelled like dirty feet and, last but least, floor was full of dust and... ants). On the second day, maid made up the room but forgot to bring new towels. I didn't notice it and had to wipe myself with the peignoir...

We chose Grand Hyatt because we wanted an international chain having come from a local beach resort.  We were allocated three rooms at the end of the corridor and right outside one room was a construction site, so not only abysmal views but hammering and workers' chatter that started early morning could be heard.  Apart from that, the room size was fine and bed was comfortable. Service was a bit slow but the hotel was fully occupied so that was understandable.  Location is good.  Fine for a one night stay.\n",

The name on the TV screen was someone else’s so they’ve clearly put us in the wrong room.  I called to complain and they promptly moved us to a better room but after a 10 hour flight I could have done without the hassle.  The hotel is not in a central location so if it’s your first time to Athens and plan to explore the city I don’t suggest staying here.  King George and Hotel Bretagne are much better choices.

We requested for 2 rooms with connecting doors with a view of the acropolis. By the time we arrived at the hotel it was already 3.30 pm. Initially we were told that we couldn’t get rooms with connecting doors. But the disappointing bit is when we arrived, one of the room is still not ready. At 3.30 pm. So we had to wait for an additional 30 mins for the other room to be ready. It is ok in many circumstances, but not ok when you have already made plans. Anyhow, our bell boy, Socrates (what a name) helped made things better by being more helpful than he has to. He made it better for us. Thanks to him.\n",

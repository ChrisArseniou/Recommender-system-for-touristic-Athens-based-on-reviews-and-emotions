      "Review is :Really clean, big rooms. We stayed in 2 huge inter-connecting rooms, which was perfect for our family of 4 adults and had a lovely big relaxing area to all relax and spend time together. Excellent house keeping staff and thank you to Gianina for tending to our rooms daily. Staff were so helpful when we accidentally locked ourselves out! Room service and restaurant food was delicious , although menu bit limited and not many veggie options but view of Acropolis from Premiere was absolutely amazing. Menu on website seems to suggest a wider range than was actually available at the restaurant eg website shows tasting menus and veggie menus so would recommend that is removed if no longer up to date. Hotel is about 20-25 minute walk to many of the main sights along a main road, one of the road crossings is a little difficult but there are lots of nearby cafes to grab drinks or snacks and the walk into Plaka and the sights is very easy. Hotel is really big, staff including bell boys, reception staff and room service and restaurant staff are so helpful and friendly and we loved it as a base for our first visit to Athens. Would very happily stay here again when I visit again in the future and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Athens.…\n",

Our suite, which had a walk in closet, a huge bathroom and a big sitting area also have a gorgeous view of the Acropolis....it was stunning.  Because we were in the suite/club, we were taken up to the club lounge for check-in.  Everyone was very professional and nice.  The club lounge had breakfast, mid-day tea and evening canapes.  All were very nice, good food, great drinks and there was a beautiful view from the lounge.  Although the hotel was not in the middle of all the sites, it was only a <30 minute walk into the main attraction area.  That made for some great exercise.    We were there for three full days and because the hotel/pool/club felt like a destination in itself, one day we just stayed onsite and enjoyed our time there.  We would definitely recommend this hotel while staying in Athens. …\n",

      "Review is :Stayed five days with friends. Booked four rooms.  Staff were very friendly, as for me is a Greeks, some of the most hospitable people in the world.   The breakfast was plentiful, staff again done a great job. It was a very busy As it’s a conference Hotel really. However that didn’t mean that it was bad. The pool was mostly quiet. And spotless clean as was the whole hotel.   Heard some say it was far away from city. For us we didn’t think so, it was literally a 15 minute walk right to the centre, however if you cross the very busy road, your literally among some great non touristy restaurants and cafes.   I never felt the staff or the policy of the hotel was to attempt to get money from you for extras, everyone was very integrity minded.   My only slight gripe was that the maid service was a bit inconsistent, so the room wasn’t made up to the same standard each day. However I mentioned it to the reception and received a letter and  bottle of wine, which wasn’t expected but appreciated. On a plus the rooms are huge, with a nice sitting area and large bathroom.   Only other thing. As we book four rooms for 5 nights , and our flight was leaving late and we needed a room to stay later, I felt the 117 euros for late checkout was a bit steep and as we had booked the four rooms I think they could have gave us a bigger discount than have the room rate , as is their policy obviously.   Other than that. It was a great hotel considering its massive size. Would definitely recommend. It’s not Dubai 5 star so if that’s what you expect you will be discounted. However it’s very good and very genuine, spotless clean and great staff.…\n",

I chose your property as a loyal customer a member of IHG and after reviewing your website which portrays a completely different picture compared to reality.  Ever since I checked in, my experience has always been the worst and so poor.   There was no one to welcome at the reception nor there was a designated line for members .   We had to wait in line for one hour to check in, No human factor interaction as from the staff no one bother to ask if we were ok or the children are happy here ! When we show how disappointed we were in the staff and the hotel another disaster.   I never thought I would face a problem like this in an IHG or even a 5 star property.   You  have electrical equipments that do not work or does not have the power to work. This way you save electricity, I hope. We had 3 shampoos and no shower gel ! That’s the other thing the towels were in bad condition!  In short, your service has completely ruined our vacation.   Im so disappointed and I will definitely comment on my travel instagram account.  AbdulRahman…\n",

      "Review is :No real complaints for this hotel.    The check-in process was quick and were given access to our room even though we we arrived before the allotted check-in time.    The room itself was huge!  Enough space for two double beds, lounge area, dressing area and large bathroom without feeling cramped at all!  The only thing I would say is that although well maintained, the rooms are starting to show their age.  We ate breakfast on our last day in Athens - and was a good spread (but not necessarily value for money if you pay the full EUR32 advertised price, but we managed to negotiate a discount so was OK).  In terms of other facilities we only really used the pool once:  fine for a quick dip but as not a resort hotel - wouldn't look to spend much time in here.  Note that there is a shallow to deep gradient in the pool so need to be careful with small kids.  In terms of location, the immediate neighbourhood of the hotel isn't great - so need to be careful.  We didn't use any of the public transport options - but Uber's are easy to come by (as are the standard taxis) and for a family of four these weren't that much more expensive than public transport options (most journeys cost EUR5-10 each way to most sights).  The sights are within walking distance if you don't mind a half hour / 40 minute walk!  There are some good restaurants within walking distance if you don't want to venture far of an evening.  There is also a Lidl supermarket within 10 minutes walking if you wish to stock up on provisions.    Overall, I wouldn't be averse to staying at the Intercontinental again if ever in Athens.…\n",

It’s away from all the tourists thronging Plaka and surrounding areas, but there is not much around it.  Still, it is an easy 25-30 minute walk to the Acropolis/Plaka and public transportation is very close.  Found the paid breakfast quite worthwhile.  Also appreciated the excellent food at the rooftop restaurant as well as friendly service at the lobby bar.  One downside of this hotel is all the cruise ship and convention groups.  They are loud and like locusts.  Plan accordingly for meals and so on.\n",

I was very pleased that we were able to check in early both times and able to park in an on-site parking garage. The room was comfortable, clean and roomy. The breakfast was excellent with lots of variety—I loved all the fresh fruit—even figs!, cheese, Greek specialities. and they probably have the best waffles. Service at breakfast was also top notch. It was very convenient that breakfast starts at 6:30 since we had an early flight. The rooftop bar is also very nice. I would definitely stay here again as I did on this trip!\n",

There are cuter parts that are within walking distance, I think I would have preferred to stay in a boutique hotel closer to the more charming part of Athens. I ranked this hotel 3 but it’s more a 3.5 and some things about it are a 4 (the rooftop bar and view from there and the pillow menu). Dinner up here was good but by far the most expensive of any meal we had in Greece (about $180 USD for 2 people, included 4 drinks). The hotel is clean, and the reception has a lot of windows so you don’t typically have to wait too long. My bed was average, I could feel the springs, but there was a pillow menu and the comforel pillow was one of the best I’ve ever had at a hotel. I…\n",

The hotel is large and beautiful with great amenities that i wish i had time to use. The club level was very nice and has a terrace with a view of acropolis. They also have a nice restaurant and bar on the rooftop with the same view. My room was spacious and clean with a very comfy bed. I ordered room service for breakfast and it came quickly and was delicious. I would definitely return to this hotel again for longer next time!\n",

      "Review is :InterContinental was part of a Delta vacation package so I wasn't certain what to expect. Exceeded my expectations!  From the minute you walk in, the hotel is immaculate. The front desk upgraded me to the InterContinental Club floor. The room was spacious with plenty of room to spread out. There is the usual mini-bar and water for your coffee/tea.  The lounge area for breakfast offered traditional Greek food. As I said to a friend, who comes to Greece to have pancakes for breakfast?  There is an afternoon tea as well as a small dinner buffet. Honestly, if you did not feel like going out to eat, you could have enjoyed all your meals in-house.  The staff was friendly and more than willing to help. The hotel is close to a tram stop which makes it convenient to get to Syntagma…\n",

      "Review is :Normally I can give a great or not so great review and I’m on the fence.   The hotel is 40 years old and obviously it has been upgraded and modernised, but has it, a lick of paint new carpets and some new signs, but does it fill the Intercontinental brand whole heartedly, I would say no.  The rooms whilst nice (we had a club room) was not exceptionally great, poor lighting, old wardrobes, no walk in shower, no USB charging, old drag along curtains and old bedroom furniture, the newest thing must be 10 years old.  Don’t get me wrong it’s no premier inn but it’s no shangri la either.  What does make it, extra special is the club lounge where the staff ALL go over and above and their offerings is great.   Would I return is the normal question I ask myself and on this occasion…\n",

As an IHG Rewards member with Diamond Ambassador status, I was upgraded from a Classic Room, to a Classic Room City View, which is all fairly pointless on the 5th floor where all you can see is the blocks of apartments next to the hotel. On my last stay before the pandemic I was given a Club Room with Club access, so that quite a downgrade and leaves you to question the validity of the rewards scheme. The room itself had seen better days, but it was OK for a short stay. I note another reviewer's comments about the tired old Club rooms, which are I guess still just as rundown as they were on my last stay, so perhaps I didn't miss anything other than the lovely terrace for breakfast.

Clean hotel, fully air conditioned which is a great relief after a day visiting the attractions. Plentiful breakfast buffet selection with lots of variety, fresh fruit was delicious.  Just off a busy road but no sound from the road. Pool area clean and pool nice for a dip, food available. Tea and coffee in room however not topped up which was a disapointment. Room cleaned daily, however on the penultimate day it wasnt which I thought odd. Consierge is helpful arranging taxis and recommending places to eat nearby. Overall a good stay, not given full marks due to no extra tea and coffe and the room change.\n",

To those reviewers who complain about long walks to the sights or less than brilliant views, do your research! Or stay in dingy hotels for twice the price with posters of the Acropolis in the lobby.  Taxis are abundant and the metro is a 10 minute walk. Lots of local restaurants and coffee shops to choose from.

The breakfast team are efficient and engaging, where the head chef is overseeing a superb selection of quality products. Really super breakfast.  We were upgraded as an Ambassador member and were thrilled with our connecting suite, thank you. It had all that we needed with nice little touches. The cleaning team did a great job every day.  Overall we were a little sad to leave such a lovely and comfortable home for 4 days.  After such difficult periods and no tourism I wish the entire hotel team an amazing 2022.  Thank you\n",

There was no mention of the club lounge is actually closed. Arrived at the hotel, we were told the club lounge was closed but we could use the lobby cafe/bar to enjoy the benefit.   Didn’t want to say anything to begin with, but one can only take so much and enough is enough. We were served this same boring finger food every time.  This is insane!\n",

Since the Club was not open due to Covid-19 they arranged everything at the bar (during the day and in the evening) and for breakfast at Zoe Café. At Zoe Café they had a great variation and the staff treated me great when they discovered that I am taking Greek coffee and olive oil for breakfast instead of American Coffee and butter.

Generous buffet breakfast including Greek specialties and continuously poured good coffee! Alternate club lounge well done. Ideal base to explore Athens. Just the perfect experience for our family; we've stayed club level at Paris- Le Grand, Madrid, Budapest, this one might top the list, and once again, none had better people.

It is just off the main road and the surrounding area is pretty urban with roughly a 10-15 minute walk to the Acropolis/Museum. It is also a short taxi ride to the coast, so overall well positioned. The property is spotless and I found the service to be good overall. Room size was excellent and sound proofing seemed decent. The gym was a reasonable size and there is a modest out door pool.  Breakfast had numerous choices, although a mark has been docked for the hot buffet section. Food was often tepid and this should be looked at.

While my room was getting prepared I had a quick bite at the restaurant near the pool. The service was a little slow (the waiters disappear inside the kitchen :) ), the plates were slightly smelly and the glass and coke bottle were sticky. The waitress was friendly nevertheless and offered a good service.   The room was elegant and the bed very comfortable.  Limited choices at breakfast for a 5-star hotel.

      "Review is :We had a very positive experience at this hotel.    The bed, pillows, and sheets were extremely comfortable.  My wife and I slept great on this bed, which is always appreciated when traveling internationally.  We had a pretty good buffet breakfast, including some great local donuts that had caramel on the inside.  So good.  It's in a good location.  Only 5-7 Euro cab fare to/from the Monastiraki Square.  Tried to use the pool, but it's a small area and it was packed so that was a no go.  The only real negative was the bar.  Only one person working so service was a little slow.  Also wasn't thrilled at $15 Euro for a single rum and coke.  Overall, a good option to stay when in Athens.\n",

Location was close to all tourist sights; and taxi's were easily available and cheap to get anywhere. There is also a tram nearby, but not close enough; so the taxi's were very convenient. View of the Acropolis was nice.\n",

Our room was not serviced on one day despite leaving the hotel at 1pm and laundry being collected and returned to the room! We phoned to let reception know when we got back at 10 pm. Got a quick apology nothing more - they had no record of this when we checked out. We booked a club rate. Again at the moment in Covid times this is really not worth it. We understand that the lounge might not be open due to restrictions - although other hotels manage to open their lounges with modified service!!! (So this cannot be entirely Covid related).

Later on, i discovered that the safe is not working and after so many phone calls, i decided to leave my passports at the hotel safe.

I felt there was genuine service culture in all areas: Reception, housekeeping, pool, lobby bar, breakfast. Together with a very well invested \"hard product\" there's little, if anything, to fault. The pool was a perfect enclave to get some sun and do a few laps. There's a short, well executed menu of staples like a Club Sandwich too.  My room, an exec double was unexpectedly large and well thought out. Wifi was fast enough to stream Netflix on my laptop too.  Overall great value for money.  As a Covid - safe escape from dreary UK weather it couldn't have been better.\n",

From contact less but still friendly check in to cleanliness in the rooms and disinfectant dispensers placed throughout the hotel, the visitor feels safe. Breakfast is served downstairs in the lobby area. The pool is still open and so is the gym but distancing is being followed. In other words, every other lounge in the pool is available, so the six foot distance can be followed.   I strongly encourage you to visit Athens or most parts of  Greece with a few exceptions, either for a short weekend or for a week, especially if you live in Europe or in a country where travel to and from Greece is allowed.

The Premier Restaurant and Bar was great and had magnificent views of the city, especially the Acropolis of Athens and the Parthenon. The shuttle to Syntagma Square was often and reliable. My only complaint would be that the TV did not allow use of the HDMI port so that I could watch media from my PC. Other than that, I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Athens.\n",

Everything required and expected from the IHG hotel you will surely find here but I wanted to make the management aware that the satellite tv is not up to the mark and very limited and outdated television. Buffet breakfast needs to be check as a guest cannot eat the same items every day not even a single item changed for all 5 days which is a strange thing. Nicole at the front desk was very professional and I like the way she handled the check-in. The housekeeping staff was very polite and attentive\n",

Locations is bit odd, but still have very nice restaurant(Hytra Michelin 1 star) right next to it. Also the hotel restaruant itself is good too.  However my biggest satisfaction was from CLub Lounge staffs.  Ms. Pemy really helped me a lot with many things. She is very professional and caring. Not exaggerated kind, but more trustable person who really cares about each customers. When I had some issue with document, she also  supported very well  Wanna say appreciation again  Thank you  아테네에서 묵을 만한 호텔입니다. 시내 중심가랑 지하철 한정거장 차이이며 동네는 약간 후집니다. 하지만 바로 옆에 Hytra라는 미슐랭 1스타 식당도 있고, 제법 재미가 있는 동네에 있습니다\n",

I've missed the Nespresso coffee facilities in the room as they have in other intercontinental hotels, but I suppose that for so many rooms, Nespresso would likely to have a dedicated factory only for this hotel. :))) TIP: Don't forget to hang out the ''Do not disturb'' sign, if you don't want to be disturbed twice in half an hour while you sleep in the morning, in the day you check out.\n",

      "Review is :I stayed at Intercontinental Athens for 6 nights and it was a good experience the hotel is around 10 min away from city center (Plaka area) it offers a free shuttle bus all day till around 10:30 pm. The rooms are spacious and rooms are renovated some of the rooms are smokings rooms. The receptionists are very helpful and facilitate the check in even for the big groups. Breakfast is good. Intercontinental is very good at organizing conferences and the staff are well prepared. Thank you for the good experience and for being very flexible. If I visit Athens again I will sure stay at Intercontinental Athens.\n",

We had the limousine service from the airport, it costs €55 as opposed to €40 for a taxi,  (we had a taxi back to airport white knuckles the whole way there.) The limousine meets you at arrivals and it’s a smooth run into the hotel were you are greeted by a member of staff.  We had booked the club lounge and the young lady took us there to check in.   Once checked in the young lady then took us to our room, lovely large room and very well appointed, but with awful views of a run down area that had graffiti all over the  buildings opposite.  Unfortunately this is the case all over Athens even historical buildings.  …\n",

From the reception and concierge services through to the bar/restaurant every single person was lovely to talk to and interact with.

The room had modern furnishings, was spacious, and had a separate living room where our child slept. We also paid extra for club lounge access, which I recommend, as it helps to have such a home base facility when exploring a city. The club lounge was laid out well and had snacks and beverages (sodas, coffee/tea, water, beer/wine) at all times it was open.

There was no excuse to deal with us in this way; another family was also standing with us and also complained. This is not what we expected from IHG. The hotel is old with very limited buffet in the main restaurant all through the day! Not Intercontinental at all.\n",

      "Review is :After visiting Santorini and Mykonos, I had to stay in Athens for couple days before going home. I'm an IHG member and this is one of the best Intercontinental hotel I've stayed before. It's a beautiful hotel. It's 15 minutes from Syntagma Square but they have free shuttle all day till night to drop us and pick us up every hour of the same location. Housekeeping were great. Breakfast in the morning is great and afternoon tea at the lounge is perfect for light snacks. I'll stay in this hotel again next time.\n",

      "Review is :We arrived at 2:30am into Athens with 7 suitcases, plus carry-on.  I had arranged an airport pickup through the concierge, who provided a van.  Our pick up was waiting for us when we were the last to emerge from the airport.  When we arrived at the hotel at 4am, a receptionist with a huge smile on her face, professionally checked us in and got us to our room within minutes.    Our room was very comfortable with a side view of the Acropolis.  We slept until 5:00pm the next day and no one bothered us.  The room service food was a bit expensive but it was also really delicious.  Instead of eating at the buffet, we opted to selectively order from room service which was quite a bit cheaper.

The hotel isn't within easy walking distance of mass transit, restaurants, or shops and the neighborhood appears run down.   There was a shuttle to town center, but it was infrequent.  Thus we relied on taxis.  The Bell Captain did a great job of weeding out the worst of the drivers (more than once he told a driver they couldn't stop there) so we didn't have many problems getting into to town, but I swear some of the taxi drivers just saw/heard  \"opportunity\" when they heard that you wanted to return to the InterContinental.   We ended up tracking them in Waze or Google maps to make sure we weren't getting too ripped off.   The good news that Athens taxis are…\n",

The hotel is great on almost all aspects, other than the location, which reduces it attractiveness slightly.  Location1: there is a free shuttle bus to the center; but it is rather infrequent (every hour or so, and stops running a little too early at night). The walk to the Metro station is rather unpleasant. It is not dangerous, but much of the walk is along a busy highway, without a proper pedestrian walkway. This means that you are stuck with the mercy of Taxis, and most of those don't have much mercy; we've taken at least 4 taxi rides each day (with some days more than 4) for a week, and 7 out of 10 rides would be fairly unpleasant or dishonest: overcharge, take…\n",

      "Review is :It is difficult to add something new to all reviews of Athenaeum InterContinental. I stayed in this hotel for a week in December 2018 for a conference. My room was large, very comfortable and quiet. The professional services were very good; friendly but not overly pushy.  Location: yes the hotel is located a bit far away from Syntagma Square. I walked to and from the hotel several times. Approximately 25 minutes one way. Yes, the path walks in Athens are terrible. I tripped several times. Be careful. Of course, this has nothing to do with the hotel. The shuttle bus goes to the Square every hour. Taxi costs approximately 10 euros.   Food: if you do not feel like eating in the hotel, there is a very small caffe in front of the hotel, in addition to a family-run eatery…\n",

The 8th floor executive and service staff are all exceptional - they seemed to know what I needed practically before I knew myself. Given my intensive schedule providing one-on-one coaching services for the MIT Enterprise Forum of Greece accelerator each year, this kind of support and thoughtfulness is extremely helpful.   My room was the same style as in previous years - lots of space, great bed, WiFi and Ethernet access, windows that open (a little bit, anyway), good shower. TV is OK though I hate that there is no Sleep option and it's a bit outdated in terms of access to movies and other features... but one does not come to Athens to watch TV! (I am just…\n",

All staff we encountered were polite and efficient and the hotel was spotless.   Where the hotel loses a star from me is, firstly, the location. Whilst geographically not too far into town, the road is incredibly busy and the air quality is poor (like walking down an A road in the UK) Pavements are sporadic and frequently had vehicles parked over them. We walked to the hotel when we arrived but didn’t do it again. There is a free regular shuttle bus but it gets busy and not every one can fit on every time. Secondly, food in the hotel is extortionate! €32 for a buffet breakfast! There are very few local…\n",

Almost every square inch is covered in graffiti, it’s generally pig ugly (except for the historic sites and even these are unkempt) and you can taste the pollution. I won’t be returning, ever. So that might colour my view of everything, so I’ll try to be fair to this hotel. First, the rooms are large, with a sofa and seating area, beds very comfortable and public areas generally clean. Prices horrific, €7.50 for a cappuccino €20 for a club sandwich but that’s probably standard for this type of hotel. Gym is pretty good for a hotel gym, pool rather small and disappointing. There’s a spa but didn’t use it. Didn’t have breakfast included in the rate and didn’t want to spend €30 a head. And there lies the…\n",

      "Review is :I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Intercontinental in December. The room was surprisingly spacious, updated and comfortable. I had a room on the second floor which could have been very noisy because the hotel is on a very busy street but the windows are double glazed and blocked out all of the road noise. The shower is great. Breakfast was included in my stay and was awesome.  I’ve stayed at other “local” hotels and had to sit in a bathtub with a wand to shower and couldn’t flush paper down the toilet. Neither of these issues were present here. I would certainly stay here again next time I’m in Athens. The only thing I’d do differently is to request a room on the 7-9th floors as they can give you a view of the Acropolis.\n",

      "Review is :My husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Athenaeum for 2 nights on our honeymoon.   The hotel held to the InterContinental standard with fine attention to detail, comfortable beds, luxury dining options, and accommodating (if not always the friendliest) staff. However, the location prevents this property from competing with other luxury hotels in Athens. There is a shuttle to and from Syntagma Square but the times aren't always convenient. I would not advise walking as the neighborhood feels less safe the farther you venture from town. We took a cab for less than 5 euro so this didn't make or break our decision to stay.  Overall I would recommend the InterContinental Athenaeum if you would like to save a few bucks on luxury accommodations by staying outside the tourist…\n",

      "Review is :Greece for a business trip in November 2018. This hotel was very close to the conference venue - fantastically so, in fact - so I stayed here during my trip.  I liked this place a lot. The room was spacious, peaceful and with all the facilities I normally like, and although the decor was a little unusual, it added to the character of the place rather than being distracting. Staff at reception were very helpful indeed, although the room staff were rather keen to pop in for various reasons - it's a good idea to have the 'do not disturb' handy.  The main downside of this place for me was a different aspect of the location. While it was close to the event, it was also a decent stroll (~30 mins) from the centre of town, where I also had some meetings set up. Not a problem on a dry…\n",

On check-in I was invited to upgrade to a better room, lounge access (open bar) and breakfast in the lounge (€73 per night extra). It was a business trip, so I took the offer.   The room was fantastic. I probably didn’t get my full value for money from the open bar/breakfast, but it did make things a lot easier.   The hotel is expansive and airy. The pool looked great, and was probably 3-4 times the size of most hotel pools. I didn’t have the opportunity to use it though, nor the gym, unfortunately.

The shuttle which takes guests into the heart of the tourist area of Athens is an added feature that keeps one from feeling too far away from things to do outside the hotel. There is no gift shop in the hotel, and the closest market is about 3-4 blocks away. There are many, many abandoned buildings nearby, which provides a little insight into Greece's economy. The hop-on-hop-off bus options are also conveniently located within about a 2 block walk. I was on the club floor, which offered a lavish breakfast buffet and evening reception each day.

I would have liked more light in the hotel room.  I found the lobby and restaurant decor quite bland.  Plants would greatly add to a sense of \"life\" and warmth.  You have the opportunity to create a place of exquisite beauty yet for me there was nothing really special that said \"Greece\" and \"Beauty\" except the view of the Acropolis from the terrace.  You could do so much more in the lobby area.\n",

The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were spacious and comfortable, with a generous sized bathroom. The breakfast in the morning was first rate with plenty of options to suit any taste.  It's a little way out from the centre but taxis are very cheap and readily available. As well as those I made good use of the free shuttle bus service that the hotel lays on, and which runs throughout the day and early evening. It drops off close to Syntagma Square which is an ideal place for heading off to explore all the sites and experiences that the city has to offer.\n",

From your valet to your Front Desk staff to your employees at the Club Floor, they are all amazing. I feel welcomed when I enter in your beautiful marble lobby. I usually upgrade to the Club Floor cause having my morning coffee with a view of Acropolis is something that cannot be matched. Your newly redesigned rooms on the Club Floor are very spacious. Please, allow me to add a few suggestions that will help your hotel deliver on a much larger scale: Begin to redesign the showers. I love showers with huge shower heads. Nowadays, international hotel chains invest in huge shower heads. Second, please do something about your room…\n",

I will try to provide you with  details that I would have wanted to know in advance.  EURO EXCHANGE: In order to take the taxi to the hotel, I did my first exchange in the United States.  For additional euros, you can get that taken care of at the front desk at the Intercontinental.  TO HOTEL FROM AIRPORT:  Prior to our arrival, I read horror stories about the taxi drivers.  We never had a problem.  The cost of the taxi for my husband and I was 45 euros to the Intercontinental Hotel and 40 euros back to the airport from the hotel.

It was such a joy working with him. 2 other Demetrius- day concierge and the pool bar attendant were also very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were spotless and well attended. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the neighborhood really is run down and we looked onto an abandoned building with lots of graffiti. I think we were told that during the Greek economy turn down that this has been happening.

This is a great place for conferences as it is about 10 minutes by car/shuttle to the Plaka, Monastiraki Square, and Syntagma Square. The conference hosts have captive audience here.  We made use of the free shuttle to Plaka. On the way back, we missed the shuttle by 2 minutes and had to wait for the next shuttle. A bit of inconvenience.  The service was attentive. I just wish the hotel is closer to the Plaka, museums, and the restaurants.\n",

I used every evening the free shuttle, which is nice to have as there is nothing around the hotel. They could improve a bit on the service side. I went in the mornings to the cafe Vienna. It will take you ages to get the attention of the staff to be able to place an order. And this besides being not busy.

We had breakfast and drinks at the cub daily and they had a nice selection of food,wine and spirits. I honestly thought the location of the hotel was great being in a less touristic area and a very easy walk in to tourist area. We did not try the shuttle but chose to walk to all the sites and logged 47 miles for the week.The Acropolis was around a 1.2 mile walk and that basically gets you into the rest of tourist areas.My advice is to eat local off the side streets and you will find great prices and selection.

The rooms are very large for a city hotel and we'll appointed. The shower water pressure was good and the breakfast was of a high standard.  The location is convenient and there is a free shuttle that will take you downtown. The staff however are the highlight of this hotel. Most city hotels have staff that are rushed St best and grumpy at their worst in my opinion. This jotel's staff were however a delight to interact with. From the concierge who was extremely courteous and helpful to the bellmen who gave us great advice on authentic Greek restaurants everyone was wonderful. The restaurant staff were gracious and no special…\n",

A full size bedroom with 2 queen beds and a separate living/dining area.  Clean bathrooms.  The staff is great.  They are very helpful and very kind.  We had dinner on the rooftop with a great view of the Acropolis.  They offer a free shuttle to Syntagma square which we used on 2 occasions.  The area around the hotel doesn't look great, but I felt safe walking at night.  There is a little restaurant behind the hotel called Vasillis.  Loved the food there and great prices.  The owners were really nice people.  We ate there twice and it was about 40 euros for 4 gyro platters and appetizers and drinks.  Very good…\n",

The suite had a view of the acropolis and the bar on the roof had a great view of it.  There is a bus to take you to the plaka and it’s an cheap, easy uber ride back depending on how late you stay. The best feature is the breakfast buffet which had something for everyone, eggs, meats, fruits, yogurts, breads, coffees, juices, cereals - excellent breakfast buffet. Excellent breakfast staff too. The concierge was also very helpful.  I would reccomend this hotel.\n",

Parking at the hotel was an extra 21 EUR per day, and we didn't bother eating at the hotel because the prices were way too high.

To note too, if you're staying here and need to get Euros, better to get from the hotel than the exchange at the airport as it the rate was better.  This Intercon is a reminder of what hotels used to look like.  Don't get me wrong, I like the new hotels too but when you say hotel...you think of grandeur and space.  This place definitely has it.  It is not flashy nor grating on the eyes.  It's pretty simple and classic.  I have stayed in a few InterCon all over and so far, does not disappoint.  Also a nice touch is the emergency life line in the shower, in case you slip and fall you can definitely reach out to someone.\n",

Although not within walking distance of the Acropolis, and rather isolated with very little in terms of shops/restaurants around it, we nevertheless found the location very convenient - tram stop is just a block away, which takes you to Syntagma Square (and Plaka) in one direction, and Piraeus port and the beaches in the other direction. Metered taxis were always readily available outside the hotel. So a big benefit during the tourist/summer seasons.  The rooftop restaurant served excellent food and offered nice views.

Ordered smoothies from pool bar area, and they were a little disappointing (although for one of them the staff very kindly refunded us!). One meant to be banana, yoghurt, honey, ginger, but it really was just like a thick yoghurt drink.

Not sure what kind of upgrade I received as Spire Ambassador, but the room is spacious and decently appointed. The room, however, is in need of a refresh/update.  The one problem we had with this property is that you can smell cigarette smoke, both stale and fresh, even on non-smoking floor/in non-smoking rooms.  However, the service was excellent, and we received a different room promptly after raising the issue with the front desk.  The fresh cigarette smoke issue is more baffling as I could not determine from where the smoke came.   Until the hotel is updated and the smoking issue addressed, I would not stay here again.\n",

Take my word for it, it's worth pushing that budget a bit further!!  They also run a great shuttle bus service into the centre which runs dead on time.\n",

Located on a double highway and surrounded by strip clubs and adult theaters, I would not exactly place it as a good tourist spot. Unless your torist visit goes to throwing euros on a stage. (Look at Google maps if you think I am kidding) Horribly overpriced everything. €12 for you to wash my shirt? €5 if I want you to empty the price jacked mini bar so I can put some beverage s in it?  Would you like breakfast? Because the buffet is €30. If you take that €30 and walk 3 blocks down the street to Favour you could feed 3 people with food that embarrasses room service.   Oh and you get charged if you use the phone to order food from outside. My room was not cleaned in the 2 days I was there. (They swapped…\n",

The check in process for the hotel was very smooth and efficient.  Staff spoke excellent english to accommodate us and explain all the hotel amenities and options that were available.   Hotel staff and Valets were very pleasant and friendly throughout our stay. Being able to offer nice restaurant suggestions for the area.  The hotel room was clean and had the modern updates.

The room was worse and more dated than the one I got the last time I stayed at the hotel (I probably got a worse room this time). The staff was fine but seemed jaded and tired.

The club lounge was excellent and unusually included one meat/potato/veg meal option per evening in addition to the more standard canapés. Great idea which more club lounges should do.  The hotel has traditional decor, is clean and the rooms are a good size. We were in  a balcony suite which included fabulous views of the Acropolis.

The view from the club lounge, choice of food and beverages and service was fantastic but sadly the only downside was that hotel was on the outskirts of the city centre and the area was a bit run down.  The hotel did run a courtesy bus into town during the day but sadly the hotel restaurant was fully booked and so dinning out in the evening involved a taxi ride.

Their properties usually strike just the right balance between elegant and corporate, without being completely over-the-top luxury.

The lobby is expansive, with a wraparound balcony housing the bar and lounge, with restaurants and shops off to the sides and function rooms on the levels below.  From reception we were escorted up to the Club InterContinental lounge for an efficient check-in, backtracking along the 8th floor once formalities were complete to our Acropolis View Club InterContinental room, a one category upgrade from a Club InterContinental room.

Executive club members have their own lounge and can check in there as well as have breakfast, evening drinks and snacks at various times, The staff in the lounge are extremely helpful and will go the extra mile for you. The lounge has a cosy homely feel and the outside balcony has beautiful views of the Acropolis - I can't think of a better place to have my breakfast each day.  The room was great.  It was nice to have sockets near the mirror for my hairdryer for a change but I could have done with dome by he bed - everyone has phones these days. The outstanding feature of the hotel however was Pavlos the concierge.  His recommendations for dinner was excellent and he seemed to work his magic to have us whisked in and out of taxis…\n",

The Club Lounge has an outside dining area with a lovely view of the Akropolis. A telescope is available on the outisde dining area for anyone wishing to view the sites in more detail. The Club Lounge staff were very helpful in giving me advice on the sites to visit.  I didn't use the spa but did make use of the pool which was great.\n",

The staff was very nice and accommodating.  We stayed for 2 nights then were taking a train to Kalabaca and returning the next day.  They stored our luggage for us for free.  I would like to add that we were permitted to go to the 11th Floor to take photos from the balconies there with no problem at all.  I read other reviews saying that they were not permitted because they did not take food included option and others saying they denied due to \"dress code\"  We were allowed mulitple times without any questions and no dress codes so I am not sure what happened with the other people.  Highly recommend this wonderful…\n",

We were put up at the Athenaeum, a hotel I have stayed at before. It had been redone in the modern style which is not my favorite, however, it was nice. The breakfast buffet was very good; there are a lot of choices. The rooms were big and the bathroom was large as well. The hotel is located in a neighborhood off a busy street. Take a walk to a grocery in the neighborhood; walk around to get the feel of a city neighborhood. A very nice hotel; I wish that the interior colors weren’t so drab.\n",

Worth paying the extra to add club access where you will have your own private checkin. They go over every little detail with you so you know exactly what you are getting and what is available on property. Club access also gives you a room on the club floor (ask for one facing the Acropolis - which lights up at night). Room was so spacious and had a separate work space. The only flaw of the room is that there were only a few outlets available (none next to the beds).  Since the lounge is available all day for beverages and snacks, it's convenient having rooms that include this feature to be on the same floor. The Club Lounge staff go out of their way to make sure you have everything…\n",

I noticed complaints in other TripAdvisor reviews about the cost of breakfast and based on the responses made by the hotel they are clearly not interested in improving their service level in this area.

It only took 40 minutes to have the cleaning staff prepare the room as I waited in the lobby. The lobby y has a nice lounge for guests to wait along with a cafe.   20 minutes later, the very friendly front desk staff alerted me to retrieve the keys and I went to my room. I WAS SHOCKED!! :) I was given upgraded to a suite. The room was beautiful. I had every intention to drop my bags and go out to see the city, but I collapsed on the bed made for the Greek Gods.    I did order room service and had the chicken breast.   WIFI in the room was wonderful. I am so sorry to not have taken photos But the room is definitely as advertised...maybe…\n",

We took the suite, which came with access to an amazing lounge, with stunning views of the Parthenon, that served a fabulous breakfast as well as a tea time snack. This was sufficient for dinner in-fact, and made the price good value for money. The rooms, though a bit dated, were still luxurious and comfortable and the housekeeping staff lovely. We had an amazing view of the Parthenon. My only comment is that it seems to be located in an area, that’s not maybe the most family friendly! Lots of strip clubs and sex shops in and around the area! Hence we didn’t venture out and about, around the area!

The decor and food are good - the bar area and pool are very nice.  I think my favorite part were the staff and the view of the Acropolis from the restaurant and the 8th floor (club floor with food all day long - really good food)...the 8th floor offers nice amenities and a more than helpful staff - they are kind, smart, informed, and gracious.

      "Review is :I stayed at the InterContinental for four nights recently, as all hotels in the centre were booked.  The hotel itself was probably built in the mid-1980s, probably to anchor an urban regeneration effort which has only partly succeeded.  The area around is a tangle of main roads and some housing; there didn't seem to be much else.  However the hotel itself is bright, clean and has been well maintained.  It has the feel of the time - cream limestone floors, lots of polished brass and so on, but its not oppressively dated.  Internal furnishings have been kept up to date and do not look 'tired'.  The strong points of a slightly older hotel are that there's a lot of space - rooms and public areas are bigger than in many more modern hotels, so I felt perfectly comfortable in my room. …\n",

The hotel has a shuttle bus to the center and back to the hotel every 15 minutes which was amazing because it saves you a whole lot of money. its really nice, I recommend it.\n",

      "Review is :I wouldn't particularly recommend this hotel unless you're attending a convention or like international chain hotels. The staff is lovely and helpful, to be sure, and the lobby is very attractive. But a) it's away from the city action; b) the room is spacious but not brilliant; and c) the plumbing was pretty poor. Our toilet backed up more than once, the shower nozzle was sub-par, and the bathtub didn't drain.  The hotel does offer a once an hour shuttle to the center, but if the shuttle fills you're out of luck (as we experienced). There's really nowhere to eat in the surrounding area. That said, if you don't mind walking 20 minutes or taking a 5 E taxi, the center is easy to get to.  Went there for a conference; would otherwise not have chosen this hote.\n",

Room extremely comfortable and well appointed, and room servicing to high standard.  The breakfast buffet is excellent and staff were invariably helpful and competent. There is a very pleasant outdoor pool open most hours. Three minor quibbles: had to queue in a long line twice to go in for breakfast, and also to check out (which took about 15 minutes). The pool, though very nice, does not have a lot of poolside loungers (the usual competition to get there first), and is not easily accessed other than by either using the back service stairs (fine if you are not on a high floor – the pool is at first floor level), or using the main customer…\n",

There are a few downsides like the position is not the best bit of town, but the shuttle every half hour right to the centre makes up for it. The Premier restaurant on the top floor does not have the best reviews on this site, other than the food is fantastic, so decided not to try it. But with areas like Plaka only a short taxi ride away, who needs a hotel restaurant.  The room (junior suite) is a great size, amenities as you would want, staff courteous and helpful.  The club lounge is too small for the volume of people and they could do with an extra staff member on the desk, but wait for it....  The views of the Acropolis are the best in the city.

The pool was a lovely temperature, surrounded by comfortable loungers and lots of fresh pool towels. We ate at the pool once and it was delicious.

It was really nice to find actual beds (versus sofa bed) for each person all in one room. That never seems to happen in Europe.   There was a very nice, outdoor pool with a deep end (about 7 ft), so the kids loved that. They had a bar where you could order food and drinks, which was really nice after a day of touring the city.  There was a huge breakfast buffet that was included in the price of the room. We also upgraded to the executive lounge so we had access to espresso, snacks, drinks, breakfast and evening snacks and wine throughout the day.

      "Review is :Stayed at this hotel for 10 nights visiting from Montreal for business. Lobby and rooms are very nice and clean, staff was extremely friendly and food from restaurants and room service was better than expected. They are not in central Athens, but they offer an hourly free shuttle service directly into the heart of the city (and back again) which we used frequently.  A few drawbacks...walls were thin and we could often hear laughing from the adjacent rooms. Immediate surrounding area seems to be quite rundown.  Only really frustrating thing was the Wi-Fi. I paid for 1 Mbps (which isn't much but all I needed to work). During the day it was fine, usually hitting around 2 Mbps. But between 7-11 PM, it was so slow it was completely unusable. I ran a speedtest and it was giving me…\n",

I found that very thoughtful of them. The hotel room was very spacious and well-appointed. I liked the decoration, the spacious bathroom and the toiletries provided had an excellent verbena scent which I loved.

We were on the first floor and a little disappointed not to have a view of the Acropolis but to be honest we were rarely in the room.

The club level has breakfast every day which is very good along with snacks, canapes, drinks and desserts throughout the day. Sandwiches and wraps at lunch and free drinks in the evening. This made it very nice to wind down after a long day of sightseeing in Athens. Service was also very good and the club lounge had excellent views of the Acropolis and out door dining.\n",

We also had to ask for the room to be re-cleaned as there were coffee splashes on the bathroom door - it looked like it had been turned-around quickly, but we did arrive earlier than planned so maybe that was why.  My only criticism is of the pricing of food and drink. Coffees are 7.50 euros which is expensive for any hotel anywhere in the world (coffee was nothing special in terms of size or quality either) and a GnT from the minibar came in at 22 euros which in my opinion is…\n",

The room service was very good. The pool was nice. The coffee lounge Vienna was very nice. Overall a pleasant stay. However the only regret was that I couldn't manage a table in the roof top restaurant despite having tried on two different nights.

      "Review is :We had a wonderful stay at the Intercontinental. The 8th floor club concierges were engaged, helpful responsive and very professional. The club was an enjoyable reprieve from the Athens heat. I enticed my adult children to play board games with me during afternoon cocktails. Nice family time. There were drinks & snacks to tide us over until our late night meals in Athens and breakfast at the club was perfect. Self-serve and lots of variety. The restaurant on top of the hotel had a beautiful view of the Acropolis and the food was really good. My husband said it was the best fish he's ever had. Suites were spacious-- old school decor was fun for a change. It was so hot in Athens when we were there that we only used our outdoor balconies at night. Pretty special to sit out on the…\n",

      "Review is :We stayed in this hotel when we visited Greece and the Greek Islands prior to the economic problems.  We chose this hotel because of its location and because it took a very reasonable number of rewards points (25,000/nt) for an Intercontinental, which is the high end of the IHG chain of hotels.  I used to be a regular business traveler and since IHG hotels, primarily Holiday Inns and Holiday Inn Expresses, are located all over the world, and also since the points reward program with IHG is excellent, I tended to stay in IHG locations a lot. I also still have lots of points left over since I retired so I still often stay at IHG hotels. One of the things I've always liked about IHG is that you can use a reasonable amount of points to book a room, often 15,000/night and on occasion…\n",

They do offer a shuttle service but I would prefer to pay a little extra and stay in Syntagma closer to everything.  The room is very dated and for the cost is quite expensive.  Not likely to return. Had coffee with family in the lobby bar and was charged £7.50 which I understand the reason is that you're in a 5 star establishment but really!!! That's AUD10 for a cold coffee!!    As there are no cafes nearby you have limited choices of where to go hence why I would recommend staying in the heart of Athens.  I also found the staff not very helpful at all.

Only downside is the surrounding area but the location is convenient for a short taxi ride to the city center or to the sea in the south.\n",

      "Review is :We arrived from a week in Crete and spent 2nights/3days at the Intercontinental . I choose the hotel based on previous stays at Intercontinental hotels around the world and location. We arrived in the afternoon after 4pm , and the front desk was extremely busy with Emirates and KLM crew check-in . Eventually its our turn not a smile to be seen on the faces of any of the staff, checked in and gave us the room key for a room on the 5th floor. the room was a horrible dark green tired looking room , I went back down to reception and was told yes thats the category you booked I told them i was willing to pay more to have a better and lighter room , so for 34euros more per night I was given a much nicer room on the 2nd floor with a partial view of the Acropolis. We had a shower and…\n",

For example, when trying to send laundry out, the paper was missing, so the shirts were taken to the front desk with assurance it would be fine.  Two limp, unstarched shirts were delivered.  The bed was comfortable, but the room had no view for the price we paid.  The lobby lounge area could use a bit better attention to crumbs, cleanliness in general, but the service was fine.

Club level rooms have access to the Club Lounge where you can sit on the patio and enjoy beverages, a breakfast buffet, afternoon tea and an evening snack at no additional cost (it was really nice).

The concierge on the Club Floor, Pammi, was wonderful and upgraded us as Ambassadors to a better suite on the top floor.  The Club Lounge had a wonderful breakfast, tea and cocktail spread that was meticulously maintained and replenished. The balcony had a fantastic view of the Acropolis. It was a short taxi ride to the Acropolis and museum.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating.\n",

For the first time ever we did not use the Hotel Club facilities, I normally spend far too much time enjoying the food and drinks and not enough time in the real local bars and restaurants. The hotel does have a mini-bus to take you into the old town, but as we enjoy walking we did not find the 20 minute walk into Plaka any hardship, in fact after a meal and drinks in the old town enjoyed the walk back to the hotel. As for the hotel our room was facing the front, on a high level with a view of Athens most famous sight, it was kept clean, a good size overall a good experience.\n",

One evening, we ordered Moussaka and were very disappointed as it was the size of a starter, but was priced at €19 and was obviously from frozen. However, I ordered a steak and it was very nice. Also, a slice of cake is €10 and tea is €7, so again very over priced especially when I compare it to other 5 star hotels.

Although I could have travelled from the airport in a taxi, I chose to take the subway to Syntagma Square before hopping on the airport shuttle bus.  Check-in was fuss-free, and I was also greeted by the supervisor on duty - I'm not sure if this special treatment is reserved for the hotel's loyalty programme members but it was a nice touch.  I had heard that the hotel was showing its age but I felt it looked in relatively good nick.  As was my regular practice, I had requested for a room away from the elevators, and the hotel was able to accommodate this request.  The…\n",

My first room was rather smelly being a smoking room but they soon changed me to a non-smoking room on request which was fine.  The only downside is the area in which the hotel sits which is a bit run down and the only bars we could see as an alternative to the hotel were bit seedy which is the best polite description I can give them.\n",

I would have given it 5 stars since I usually don't bother except for one incident. In the beginning there was cake and biscuits and then they disappeared because sandwiches needed to come. My son didn't have any so made a fuss about it and he started crying. I told the waitress to get back some for us but she never did. She did ask for some but they told her they couldn't be reached any more, apparently we weren't worth the effort? Truly dissapointing. Not a five star…\n",

The mattresses are OK but not 5 stars level either. There are some worse 5 stars in Athens in this respect (see my other reviews), but also some better ones. And that has to change - the bed provides too little support, is too wobbly. Not horrible, but not to the level. Everything else in the hotel is great: rooms, bathrooms, cleanliness, breakfast, service. No issues. The area is not great and looks gloomy, but I got used to it (did I mention I come often?), and you can find a couple of places selling stuff to eat, or coffee, around Neos Cosmos or even (nowadays) close to the hotel.

This hotel is not in the concentrated tourist area which might be a minus point for some but i enjoyed the opportunity to see how locals live and it was nice to get away from the touristy bustle after a long day. Small minus point for the fact that no one offered to help with my case on check in (just when one wheel broke) Big minus point was while checking out I overheard the desk girl telling new guest about the shuttle that drops of guest for free in the city center, while I had been spending on taxis or…\n",

We only received the welcome drinks and was upgraded just to the other room category although the hotel was 20% occupied only and there was a chance to upgrade me for the acropolis view but the receptionist insisted that this what she have, the other day I was in the lobby and heard one of the guests asked to change his room and been upgraded to Acropolis view  (this is really bad), since you have the chance to upgrade your loyal customer then you have to do.  Room: was clean and spacious, the furniture in good condition.  Location: Not close to the city center but the hotel offer a free shuttle with different timings. …\n",

The room we stayed in was nice and spacious. However, the bed was not very comfortable and felt too springy. We expected the mattress to at least have a memory foam topper. In terms of location, the hotel is about 20-30 min walking distance to the Acropolis. The hotel offers a shuttle to/from Syntagma Square. We took advantage of this shuttle when we arrived and departed Athens since we decided to take the airport express bus from Syntagma Square. The shuttle driver helped us with our bags the day we arrived, but seemed to ignore us the day we departed. We assumed this was because we didn't tip him (we thought tips weren't…\n",

I left a drawing that I had purchased at the Parthenon in the room and called about it the day after we got back and realised it was missing; only to be told they couldn't find it - bit rubbish in my opinion as it was only £20 euro souvenir so can't imagine why anyone would steal it - disappointing.\n",

We had a fantastic room really comfy bed and excellent view of the acropolis.the room had use of the lounge facility so had nibbles and drinks available throughout the day, we were also able to have breakfast which as we had booked room only was a fantastic benefit.  The hotel is a little out of the city centre which for us was ok,the hotel had a shuttle service which did operate ,Greek, time but was nice to have, Athens centre was only a €5 taxi away . The hotel has a nice pool area which after a day's sight seeing was nice to use before getting ready for the evening I can only…\n",

      "Review is :This is a vast hotel on a very busy road in a grotty part of the city, not a very convenient location. There are great views over the Acropolis from some parts of the hotel, notably the bar/ restaurant on the top floor. The hotel is great for business and service levels are very high.   I was put in a huge bedroom with a vast bed, but an interconnecting door to the next bedroom meant I could hear everything they were doing. Since this included playing music and laughing loudly at 2am, I soon got very cross, and phoned reception several times. To no avail. The next day, at my insistence, I was moved to a room with fantastic sound insulation and had a decent night's sleep.   There are 2 places to eat in the evening. The rooftop place with breathtaking views and eye watering prices…\n",

This hotel is more geared towards business guests in my opinion and there was a conference for several hundred people when I stayed. This didn't cause a problem at all.  The pool and loungers are all very nice but €7.50 for a coke and €25 for a salad?! We can recommend Pilots which is a cafe just a 5 minute walk away on the other side of the dual carriage way and 10 minutes walk up the dual carriageway (not literally) there are 3 restaurants, 4 of us ate at the Italian for €80, inc 2 courses and 2 drinks each.  Rooftop bar is nice, good view of the city.\n",

Staff was professional, allowed us to check-in early, provided us with a rollaway bed at no extra charge, room was clean, elevators were fast, had an outdoor pool, and location was not too far from the Acropolis (takes about 15 mins by foot).  Only complaints were:   1. Guestroom decor...appears a little worn.  The toilet flushes by pulling a lever that's installed to the wall and you have to pull down hard. Also the curtain in the bathtub is a glass swing door which is a little odd and can cause water to splash out if you don't adjust the shower head to aim correctly.  2.

We stayed on the Club suites floor and had a lovely view of the Acropolis over breakfast and evening canapés.  The bar area was closed while we were there but enjoyed a pre-dinner drink in the lounge area.  Strange choice of ambient music in the background perhaps which did tend to go on a bit.  The downside as far as I was concerned was the location.  Walking to the old part of the city is a trek and along a busy road that becomes a dual carriageway with two lanes of racing traffic - a nightmare to cross.  The road is also a bit down-market.  Make sure you take a taxi or the shuttle bus\n",

The hotel was very clean.   We didn't have any smoke smell like some other reviewers and the staff was very friendly. We didn't go to the restaurant as it was very expensive and we prefer exploring the restaurants in the city.  Also, we stayed clear of the 68 Euro upgrade (per person) to get breakfast included! The downside was the location, which was too far to walk to city center (Monastiraki, Acropolis etc) and there are lots of sex shops nearby.  We didn't know about the shuttle until we checked out but the cab ride was cheap enough : about 5 Euro to get to Monastiraki.\n",

Everywhere you turned there was a member of staff who, politely, asked if they could help with anything. From the front desk, waiters, bar tenders outside doormen, in fact everyone we met, were all on point and singing from the same hymn sheet and providing excellent service all round. Whoever is the training instructor for the staff at the hotel should, in my opinion, get a pat on the back from the board of directors and the GM.

Some negatives, but on basis of it probably being best room we've ever been given (especially relative to price) I'm going with 5 stars! It's a large international chain so unfair to rate on boutique criteria but having had weeks of the latter we actually wanted something a bit more formal that would allow us to step back into reality, albeit gently!

The rooms on the lower floors are small and need updating.  Most of the higher level floors have been nicely renovated.  If you plan on staying several days, I suggest paying the $200 to be an IHG Ambassador member.  You are guaranteed a room up grade and i comes with other benefits that make it worth the fee.  All & all, i would recommend this hotel and would stay there again myself.  It is generally what one would expect from an older Intercontinental Hotel.\n",

A special twist to the hotel is that it isn't in the nicest part of town any more, so especially with the recession and the debt crisis hitting Greece, stepping out of the front door provides quite a contrast of closed shops, potholes you could hide a rhinoceros in, broken windows etc.\n",

The bed did meet the standards one would have for the Intercontinental brand, so that was great.    The other big positive was the pool.  There is food and beverage service, the loungers are in good repair, the temperature is comfortable, there's a nice feel to it overall.

We had booked a room on the executive floor and because of our status with them we got a double upgrade. We got a suite on the executive flour  There was a problem with the internet and the manager from the business solved it himself by installing a router.  The breakfast was good, as well as the snacks during the evening hours were different the 4 nights.  There is only one problem and I will describe it for the next trip; smoking on the balcony from the lounge.  A good place to stay with a nice view on the Acropolis.\n",

We booked it on hotel points as we are IGH Group loyalty hotel members- so sadly were (I guess as expected) offered the lowest category rooms in the hotel - my husband had emailed the hotel long before we arrived asking for interconnecting rooms for our family (2 adults and 3 young children), but were told upon arrival that the hotel was fully booked and we could only have two rooms on the same low floor but about 10-20 rooms apart from each other - not quite acceptable with young children in tow!

Although it is a (longish) walking distance from the Acropolis and the centre, and there is a hotel bus service, you don't want to wander out of the hotel and walk round the neighbouring  streets. It is surrounded by ugly concrete buildings covered in graffiti. However, I was there for a conference and spent most of my time inside the hotel. My room was very large, quiet and comfortable, overlooking the pool. I was tempted to use the pool but it gets very full of people. The conference food was nice, and the bistrot on the ground floor is good. I didn't try it but there is a formal restaurant on the top floor. Breakfast was a full buffet and up to the standard of the hotel. The staff were very nice and the service excellent. Airport transfer costs a…\n",

Good location within walking distance to restaurants and local tram, and a short taxi ride to the key sights.  We discovered that it's the people in the Concierge team that make this place a success. Nothing is too small or too big for them to assist guests with.   A very special shout out to Pavlos who went out of his way by ringing his dentist and arranging for transport when we were faced with an emergency for our DD. THANK YOU Pavlos.   Checkin experience and room are nothing to write about. In fact, a couple of things in the room did not work properly, but it was not a show stopper for us.\n",

The view of the Acropolis from our room was spectacular and the room its self was big and modern. The only negative thing I have to say is that the snacks at the club lounge during dinner time were less than appetizing and since non were labeled, you had no idea what you were getting. Also, during our last night at the lounge, a young man (one of the staff members with curly dark hair) that I have not seen previously, worked more like a security guard, watching people's every move and bite. Very uncomfortable. However, with everything being said, this is one of the best Intercontinental hotels I have stayed at.\n",

It's breakfast. Sure somebody will justify it by saying huge choice and what's available.

The rooms have seen better day, clean but a lot of damaged edges and stains in my room. No chance to open the windows.  Beds have been comfortable. Prices for the minibar or anything else in the hotel is outrageous as a coffee cost 10 Euro and 5 Ouzo and a beer 90! Euro. Just outside are quite cheap bars where you can have a lot of more value for your money,  Pool was under renovation.  The price policy overall spoiled my stay\n",

Perhaps the only con would be location - if you prefer to be somewhere within walking distance of all the souvenir shops/monastiraki etc then this may not be it. This wasn't an issue for us - we took a taxi, which cost around 5 Euros. It is probably walkable if you don't have young children.\n",

      "Review is :The Athenaeum Intercontinental Athens is what you’d expect from most hotel chains that have had their moment in the sun and are now in the process of re-inventing themselves. To the hotel’s credit it does look and feel promising once you’re inside the main foyer; not a wow factor but a good standard. Yet so many lost opportunities for IHG to differentiate itself from competitors.  Airport to Hotel Check In  A tricky thing is that as an Ambassador check in is at the Ambassadors Club on the 8th floor but you don’t know that until you actually go to the front desk and are redirected. Tip #1 for IHG – how about treating your Ambassadors like special, privileged guests?

We had dinner on our first night in Cafe Vienna, service was slow, but acknowledged and apologies followed. The hotel is a little out of town, but there is a free hotel shuttle to close to the main train station, about 15 minutes, depending on traffic.

The hotel offered a free shuttle to the downtown area of Athens and their lobby was pretty decent, but those were the only positives about this hotel.  The room was VERY outdated and the bed was very uncomfortable and on top of that, we had to pay for WIFI (a little ridiculous in this day and age).  The hotel is also not in the BEST of neighborhoods and I would not recommend walking around after dark.  We also tried to book a reservation at their rooftop restaurant, but they are closed Sundays and Mondays so we were unable to try that.  We will more than likely book somewhere else if we ever go back to Athens.\n",

As an Ambassador member, I was upgraded to a room with an Acropolis view which was nice.  Pema who was in the Club Lounge was fantastic and gave a full explanation of all the services which were available to us which included breakfast buffet in the morning and canapés and drinks in the evening (there were also nibbles out during the day but we were always out).  The room was large and had a big bed, a sofa and armchair and a table for working.  The housekeeping was immaculate and the turndown service in the evenings was a nice addition.

It's location to the Acropolis is perfect.  I took a taxi for just a few dollars and walked back.  From the moment I pulled up to the curb (valet parking only) I felt special.  But once you are inside you may forget there is anything outside of the hotel.  The hotel is beautiful, spacious and polished to a glow.  From check-in to check-out everyone I came into contact with was a delight.  My room was very nice, comfortable clean and quiet.  unfortunately this was a short stay.  I'm really looking forward to a time when I can spend a significant amount of time here.\n",

Another remarkable point is the roof garden restaurant with an amazing view of the Acropolis. Last but not least hotel staff who really behaves as a five star service in any occasion with also a warm relationship and not only a professional one. Coming to negative points I've seen only one, the lack of maintenance all around. I'd like to highlight examples such as the very old air conditioning system difficult to set and very noisy. Or the lack of sockets in order to recharge more than one mobile device at the same time: I have 3 and I was not able to find a way to recharge all together. All…\n",

Highly recommend the Club Floor as the staff and service was incredible, and breakfast on the patio every morning overlooking the sunrise over city was quite memorable. The hotel also offers great happy hour service, including tasty fare that is great for a light dinner with delicious Greek wines. Light and refreshing after long days spent exploring.

The Acropolis is within walking distance from the hotel as is Hadrian's Arch (ask the shuttle bus driver nicely and he may drop you at Hadrian's Arch).

My only comment is that when I request a tea pot for my tea, I don't want a discussion with the waiter regarding the relative merits of a hot water flask vs a tea pot, I want to have a tea pot brought to my table. However, the waiter seemed a nice guy, I was in a hurry, and I didn't want to spoil anyone's day, so I put up with tea brewed in a water flask.

The area around the hotel isn't the best and there aren't too many nearby cafes if you want to grab a quick bite down the street.  Although you can walk to the Plaka area, it is a hike.  They have a shuttle that is very regular and easy to use, which was very convenient, getting you from place to place.  I would recommend staying at someone in the center of town.\n",

Best I have had in Athens. Outdoor pool is not huge, but enough to swim if you are not an elite sportsperson (I am not, I can live with 25 meters). And you can swim quite late in the year.

I don't think that I will ever go there again at least for coffee but if accommodation is like cafeteria I prefer to go at a hotel a little metres further and imagine how desperate I am cause it is a bad neighborhood next to a sex shop.\n",

All to all nice hotel with a shuttle service to the city center but not 100% as per the regular IC standards. Staff was nice too!\n",

I wouldn't even mind that the wifi cost additional 6 euros, because I got a chance to escape emails and rest. BUT that the hotel serves filtered coffee for 6,5 euros is unacceptable. Not the price but the existence of filtered coffee in five star hotel just kills the brand image. It's like acrylic manicure on a lady.\n",

We were greeted immediately by a lovely bellman, who took our luggage and showed us to the Receptionist.  We were accompanied to the Club floor, where our check-in process was completed quickly and efficiently. Our room was lovely...large, immaculate, with up to date furnishings.  Our mattress was comfortable, the linens/towels were plush and soft; the bathroom was so clean and had an abundance of toiletries and towels that all three of us had what we needed.  Complimentary water was provided each night. There is a refrigerator/mini bar that allowed enough space for a few of our personal items. A kettle with coffee/tea is also in the room.

During our check in we told the lady at the club lounge who happened to be the manager there and she straight away called the airport- we didn't expect this and this is what I call going the extra mile!  Suitcase located in London an hr later and before the next morning we got it ( it arrived at 4.30 am at the hotel). I can't recommend the place enough!!! Lovely staff, great service!

Ignore the other reviews on here saying the hotel is in a bad area. A few strip joints and sex shops does not a bad area make, and regardless they aren't anywhere near the hotel unless you go wandering.

Beware, we took a ride from the hotel to airport and were told by hotel staff that it would cost a flat fare of 38 euros, but taxi driver claimed it was 40 due to non central location.

If you are not planning to use taxi for transportation, the area around the hotel is a bit dodgy especially late at night. The closest metro station is a good 20 mins walk away.

Our room and bathroom were very spacious.  It's true that the hotel isn't really within walking distance to most attractions, but taxi fare is pretty reasonable (should be about $4 or $5 USD to the Acropolis area, though one driver charged us $8).

So I tripple check that they are not elsewhere in the room or my bag or in the hotel laundry...But NO..

After a problem on check in and confusion about my room, I was given a double upgrade - a spacious two room suite with a wonderful terrace and view of the Acropolis.  The room itself had a lovely sitting area and of course a comfy bed. The terrace meant I could have a glass of wine and watch the sun set on my own. I had a room service dinner out there one evening and it was perfect.   I was traveling alone after my partner had to pull out so I wasn't in a great mood. the staff did everything they could to make this an amazing time. the Club Floor is the best place to stay - the daily spread from breakfast to cocktails in the evening is just right.

One person I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to is the Guest Relations Manager Martha Pallis.  Martha helped us with all our enquiries on what to do and how to get around Athens.

Not much in the local area as its out of Athens centre by a ten minute drive but the free hotel shuttle bus runs you in and back on a regular  timetable. The view of the Acropolis at night from the bar on the top floor says it all. It as the ideal base to explore from and the there are excellent tours which pick up from this hotel.\n",

We were both very excited to go to this particular hotel since we had received a voucher and we also work in the same industry. Once we arrived to the hotel, how first impression was completely destroyed once we were received by the shift leader of the reception, Stavros. He was extremely rude to us when we asked how the credit card policy worked at the hotel by answering that we should know since we work in the same industry. This is completely unexceptable - we are still clients of the hotel and all hotels have different policies. He should have offered us the option to do a cash deposit if needed.

Nevertheless, The location is not great as it is distant from any major site and nearest metro station is 20 minutes long. For a five star hotel, you would expect more. The rooms are a bit old and sometimes, we felt there are areas that need to be refurbished.  Some reviews criticised the hotel for the paid wifi.

The area is not great, quite run down, and along the main avenue near the hotel quite a few sex shops and sex shows! The photo of the outside of hotel is very deceiving, because it is in a very built up area. The pool was nice and extremely clean, but also quite a cramped area, and where I was sunbathing, on a small balcony part, I could hear the traffic of the busy road by the hotel.

The neighborhood was a bit dodgy, abandoned, graffiti tagged building... might be scary at night for some.

The hotel has the usual boutiques and jewellery shops, although the prices are high. Fans of modern art will appreciate the various pieces on display throughout the public areas of thr hotel.

The rooms were large and comfortable and bathrooms were again large and functional but both the room and bathroom are now in need of modernisation, this would not stop us staying again but investment is needed sooner rather than later. The Club lounge is one of the best we have used, lots of seating although more table with chairs rather than large sofas would make it easier to use.  In the Club lounge was an excellent choice for breakfast with plenty of hot and cold selections to suit most tastes. The lounge produced different food presentations…\n",

      "Review is :Most of what we can say about this hotel is positive. Everyone on the staff was de minimus helpful and in many cases worthy of praise. Breakfast was plentiful and well worth the additional money to sign up for it. Lunch in the downstairs small dining area, in part of the lobby ( we were too late for breakfast one day), tasty and pleasant. The concierge(s) could not have been more agreeable or more helpful. A real asset. I have no hesitation about recommending this hotel while at the same time it should not be considered a luxury hotel.  To be clear, the rooms are spacious and  well cared for. One small point, if you want a room with a king size bed, apparently do not only make a reservation for the King Room, you must be absolutely clear to specify a king sized bed.\n",

Guest rooms are large and have great amenities. The concierge and lobby staff are very friendly. If you are a IHG rewards member, as we were, you receive free Wi-Fi. So if you're not, register before going to hotel or even while you are there to get the free Wi-Fi.  We decided to venture out for lunch, to get a 'local' experience, but we were tired and didn't want to go too far. Nothing nearby, small café across the street, that's about it.

There is also a small pool bar.  We ate at the Vienna Bistrot which was reasonably priced for a hotel.  There is a rooftop bar (expect to pay 20 euros for cocktails and 8 euros for beer) with a nice view of the Acropolis.  The hotel is not in a a particularly nice or scenic part of Athens with little to no restaurants or scenery accessible by foot has a quick complimentary shuttle bus to the heart of Athens which ran regularly.

There is kind of a weird 2 block void around the hotel where there are not really any restaurants or shops, but they do offer a free shuttle to take you around the city center which is great. Plus a taxi ride to and from here is super cheap. The food and drink prices are the only negative I have about this place. Now I expect to pay high prices for anything out of the minibar in the room, but €7 for a CAN of soda is out of control.

Then I realised that the free shuttle that takes you up to syntagma square was the gateway to a different experience all together. Just 5 minutes in the bus or 20 minutes walk and you are in restaurant and market city! Thank god I found this gateway because otherwise I would have gone hungry for the 10 days.

Nevertheless, it is always a joy coming home to a well-kept room (turndown service every day!) and having my luxurious baths (love their toiletries set!) were actual highlights of my stay there. They have a plethora of selection for their breakfast buffet, and while it seems their restaurant is understaffed, surprisingly they were able to keep pace with the turn over of customers.

The hotel had a very convenient free shuttle service to Syntagma Square which came and went every 30 minutes or so. The breakfast buffet was good as well. The staff are very attentive and professional. The hotel rooftop restaurant was exceptional and offered very nice views of the city and some of the Acropolis. I would recommend going to the restaurant even if you do not stay at the hotel. Though it is a little pricey, the great food, service, and wonderful view made it worth it. Overall, this was a nice hotel that complemented our great experience in Athens.\n",

On booking the hotel I was really surprised by how good the advanced rate being offered was, for an acropolis view deluxe it was under 100 pounds.

We enjoyed an after dinner drink in the great open lobby but I must mention couches in the lobby are worn and in desperate need of replacement. Breakfast was wonderful with a great choice of all the items you…\n",

The Intercontinental is located just 2 miles from the world renowned Acropolis and Parthenon as well as other historical sites throughout the city, so the location was terrific.  Georgia at the Intercontinental arranged a taxi for us upon our arrival at the  Athens airport, which we deeply appreciated after 32 hours of flying. The driver met us the second we exited baggage claim and delivered us promptly to our destination.

The staff on check in excelled themselves following an Expedia booking error where they had booked us 3 rooms instead of 2. The hotel were nothing short of excellent in rectifying the issue and even though it was not their fault, they even upgraded us to 2 deluxe rooms for the inconvenience. The bar in the foyer was a tad on the dear side, especially at €14.50 for a gin and tonic, but hey ho we were on holiday. The best part though must have been the roof top bar with an amazing view of the Acropolis at night. Stunning !! The rooms were big, very comfortable beds and of course an interconnecting door to the kids room. All in all a great place to stay for 1 or 2 nights.\n",

Breakfast is great (22 euros for continental excl. VAT) but again with that money you can have dinner by the sea.

At check out time she was uncapable of raising up from her bed and I went down to reception. The gentleman in charge of the front desk listened to my worried request for an extension of check out and in less than a minute I was granted the additional afternnon ours at no extra cost. As we say in our country \"it is Little details that enamore you\".  Beside this kidness I must add that the hotel has an exceptional breakfast buffet and outstanding service in every other respect. It is certainly a sure bet to recommend it.\n",

The rooms are of a large size, clean and with all of the amenities one would expect from an InterContinental Hotel.  The staff bend over backwards to make your stay as pleasurable as possible. The food is of a high standard The swimming pool is comfortable but your relaxation can be spoiled by the outside road noise. Saying that one does not get any of the road noise in the room. When I said that the hotel is in the wrong area, it is about ten minuets out of the center of the city in a rather run down area.

I would not say it is best location, but it is close to center and have convenient public transport or taxi always waiting at front door.  Fast internet is not free. Strongly recommend to select rooms  with Acropolis view, but those are little bit more expensive, Ask high floor and quiet rooms, to avoid noise from outside Syngrou avenue if you don't care about Acropolis view.\n",

The only downside of the hotel is the location, which is a little away from the main areas of Athens.  This didn't bother us too much as we were attending a sporting event, so didn't have much time for tourism.  There is a tram-stop a short walk from the hotel, which connects to the wider metro system, although the trams can be a little infrequent at the weekend.\n",

During breakfast, the servers made sure that our coffee cups were often refilled.  When we arrived our hotel room was not ready so we ate lunch in the lobby and the food was very good.  We also had drinks one night in the lobby area - while the service was somewhat slow - the wine was tasty after a long day of sightseeing.  Our hotel room was on the first floor and was spacious and clean.  There was coffee and a hot water pot in the room.  The bathroom was good size and clean.  We received clean towels every day.  This hotel provides a shuttle to an area…\n",

Reception as you'd expect from Intercontinental highlight though the room which was excellent, well proportioned and nicely laid out with large comfortable bed, comfortable bathroom even for me (shower ;large and good), sitting area good basically a very high quality stay with excellent turn down service and guest attention.\n",

      "Review is :As our driver explained to us on our way to the hotel from the airport--\"very good location! In the middle of things and yet outside of things\".  The hotel and staff are what I would expect from an InterContinental and please use the free van that runs you into the center of things in Athens (10 minutes away).  What our driver meant by his comment was that you are close in and yet if demonstrations are going on--as they do in Athens in these times--you are outside the area usually affected.  We had the upgraded package that included breakfast in the morning (great!) and drinks and snacks in the afternoon--well worth it and you have a fabulous view of the Acropolis.  It is a bit \"weird\" getting to the hotel so have the address available if you get a somewhat inexperienced driver…\n",

The hotel had a spacious lobby, check in was efficient and courteous, and security was good with lifts needing a key card to activate. Our room was comfortable and spacious. We dined at the Bistro Vienna - very attentive waiting staff and servings were generous. We were thankful to find quality accommodation at such short notice.\n",

It was very comfortable and the staff both at the main floor reception and club level were very friendly and eager to help.   Breakfast was included for club guests in the lounge, very fresh with lots of choices and a nice patio to sit outside and enjoy the view facing the Parthenon.  Also included were evening snacks and wine after 6pm.   The hotel had a free shuttle to take you closer to landmarks, which we used a couple of times.   It's a large hotel, but by staying on the club floor definitely feels less crowded and a little more exclusive; for sure worth the upgrade.\n",

As a platinum member I was upgraded to a better room and offered club access at half price which I gladly accepted, so it only cost me EUR 64 for 2 days which is a bargain, in the lounge itself the staff were extremely attentive and friendly, also the view from the lounge terrace is just stunning with the Acropolis in the background which is especially nice at night when it's lit up. Unfortunately I don't get to Athens very often but if I do ever return I'll definitely be staying again at the Intercontinental…\n",

As the hotel is a bit out of the centrum of the city, the hotel offers a free minibus to the centrum. If you need to go at a time when there is no minibus, taxi rides are not dear either about € 4 to the centrum. The room I had was spacious and so was the bathroom. The sower was combined with the bath tub and therefore had a high instep and the bottom of the bath tub was not wide enough to stand comfortably. Toiletry were from Molton Brown.

The executive level staff are excellent professionals and were extremely helpful and totally fulfilled our needs.  The lounge was well stocked. Breakfast is a complete breakfast with hot and cold items.  Cocktail hour had great warm and cold snacks with three types of wine, multiple beers and fully stocked bar.

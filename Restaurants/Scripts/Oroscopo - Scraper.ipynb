We ordered something light, and we’re surprised when they brought us a complimentary small bowl of delicious soup to start. On the house. Our meal was superb, and then they brought a complimentary dessert. Actually, the plate had small portions of two desserts! Everything was delicious. You are not rushed, and have plenty of time to relax and enjoy.  Later in our visit to Athen, we went back and said we’d like just a glass of wine and a small cheese plate. Once again we got a complimentary soup to start and dessert to finish. And the cheese plate was so special! There were four pieces of a soft cheese shaped to look like pears and lightly deep fried.

Then, bread appeared on the table, then soup, and finally a desert none of which I have ordered but the gentleman who served...me stated “on the house”. I didn’t touch the desert as I am lactose intolerant. When I got the bill, I was surprised to see additional charges for bread and dips for ~1.90. It is not a huge deal but surely if these things were not ordered and as stated “on the house”  they shouldn’t appear on the bill. Otherwise - quick service, a bit cold food and taste OK.More\n",

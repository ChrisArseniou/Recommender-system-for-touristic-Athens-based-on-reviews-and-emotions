We arrived and were barely greeted by a very grumpy server. When we ordered appetizers, we were asked what else we’d be ordering. We...said we had not yet decided (and that clearly set off our server). She stormed off and was sour the rest of the time during which we observed her. Our second server seemed ok except that other than for the two minutes in which he took our additional order, we never saw him again. Our entrees took an additional 56 minutes beyond our appetizers (56 minutes after putting the additional order in…). We wanted additional drinks but were never able to flag down a server so could not order. We also could not order dessert. We waited 34 minutes after finishing our food to flag someone down in order to pay. By the way, there were only three other tables seated and at least three servers. So, either these servers are major novices (stay away!) or, they’re major jerks (stay away!). Strofi, you were a huge disappointment. Plenty of great food in Athens. No thank you to Strofi.More\n",

      "Review is :We had tickets to show at the Odeon of Herodes and this restaurant is about a block away, making it a perfect choice if you are planning to see a show yourself. We had a lovely view of the Acropolis. For an appetizer we enjoyed...stuffed vine leaves with a lemon sauce which, despite including rice, somehow were very light. For dinner we had a pork dish and lamb stuffed with sundried tomatoes and cheese. The lamb in particular was good, but the pork was overcooked. The service was friendly and attentive. For dessert we had something that was almost like a light bread pudding with ice cream and marinated cherries. It was sweet but not heavy. The location and view can’t be beat which is really why we came. It was not the best food we had in Athens, but it was what we were looking for that night.More\n",

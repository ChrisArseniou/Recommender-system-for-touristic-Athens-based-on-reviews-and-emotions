We shared the grilled tuna on focaccia.  I had the Shrimp Linguine and my friend...the Lamb.  The linguine tastes like a dried version of prawn noodles, fragrant and without any taste of tomatoes.  The lamb literally melts in your mouth.  Dessert was complimentary of Zoey, a Greek version of \"cheese cake\" but with Greek ingredients and inspiration, with Masthika dessert wine.  A fantastic restaurant with excellent food.  Glad we tried this on our last night in Athens.More\n",

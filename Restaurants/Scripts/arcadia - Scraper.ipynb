We are generally not big eaters and I am sometimes hampered by my Celiac  and other dietary restrictions, But the menu here contained so many appealing choices that...we splurged and had appetizers as well as the main course.For appetizers we had the saganaki  and the marinated anchovies, both of which were perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful. For the main courses we had lamb chops and a lamb speciality dish.  Again, Both dishes were mouthwateringly delicious.  The small bottles of Cabernet wine were some of the best we’ve had in Greece as well.\n",

At the same time you receive a very kind reception and the restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere even though you are sitting outside on the busy pedestrian street across from the Acropolis museum.

Some traditional Greek choices, but also Mediterranean dishes and simple but thoughtful wine choices.  I had the grilled sea bream, and my wife had a lentil salad and carrot soup....Part of a “restaurant row” on this street, with multiple dining choices and lots of fun energy, with indoor and outdoor seating.  Service was quick, efficient, and engaging.  Would highly recommend it for a casual supper in Athens.More\n",

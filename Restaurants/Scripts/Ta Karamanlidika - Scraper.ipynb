      "Review is :Off the beaten path and not very touristy. We tried to go back a second time but they were closed on Sundays. We try not to eat at the same place on vacation but we wanted to go back for the sausages. The food here...is slow cooked, comfort food, served in a deli like environment. They start you off with complimentary corn beef. Very delicate and very good. The eggplant dishes(eggplant with feta and zucchini and the eggplant with garlic purée) were both good. The grape leaves were typical but satisfying. The sausages are great, flavor bombs with great smokiness from the grill and very juicy(watch for flying meat juice as you cut them juicy). They are served with yogurt, red onion, mustard, and a thick pita bread.  Dessert is also complimentary in the form of carrot cooked in honey on top of yogurt. You want this, even if you think you don’t. Act surprised if you already know you’re getting this because they like to quiz you on what you think it is. Service was very hospitable.More\n",

The drop-off place was not too exciting in fact a little...intimidating but after following his instructions and after the 200 meters we were in what can we describe as Party Central,  a collection of restaurants and bars at a crossroads We found the restaurant and our  table was waiting for us. We placed our order, drinks came quite quickly and appetisers we’re not at all slow. The main courses were quite quick as well.  It was very interesting as we were sat outside the restaurant and as cars and scooters drove by it added to the buzz of the area.  The restaurant opposite had a Cuban music presentation which again added to the buzz of the area. All in all a very enjoyable experience, the quality of the food and drink was excellent, the  prices were very reasonable and Andreas our waiter did a great job in looking after us.\n",

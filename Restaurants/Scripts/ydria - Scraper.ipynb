The waiters were the friendliest we came across during...our 8 day stay in Athens, and were very attentive, polite and welcoming. We really enjoyed the moussaka, truffle & cheese fries, greek salad and banana split- all delicious and reasonably priced for the quality & flavour! \n",

Although this screams \"tourist trap\" and usually we would avoid places with this heckling, I would have happily gone back third time just for the truffle fries so please don't be put off by this!More\n",

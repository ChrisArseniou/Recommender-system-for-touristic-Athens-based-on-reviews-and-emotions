It tasted like nothing much. Zero flavour. The squid smelled weird. We are nearly sure it was cooked next door, as it did not come from the kitchen behind us, but from the street in front. Greek salad that one could find anywhere.

Ordered houmous to start then my wife ordered fish (with rice and veg) for...main and I ordered Moussaka. For some reason the Veg for my wife’s main came with the Houmous, we sent it back, she then didn’t get rice with her fish, the veg came on its own and my moussaka was cold and very very dry. Because of the time everything had taken I sent it back and didn’t re-order anything else. The mains were a disaster. To be fair to the manager / owner he removed my Moussaka off the bill, hence 2 stars, although tried to say he’d tested the heat with a thermometer and it seemed fine, how it could be fine is beyond me, maybe the thermometer was broke because it took me 10 minutes from getting it to get hold of someone to tell them, and it was cold when it arrived.More\n",

Lamb and desserts were especially great while pumpkin with chestnuts was absolutely mind-blowing. Whole menu set have created very autumn feels which we...really appreciated. My wife has an allergy so she got another dessert without any troubles. We were actually full at the end of the evening and personnel kindly helped us to order taxi. Highly recommend!More\n",

My wife is vegan and I am not, they accommodated us with one vegan tasting menu and one regular tasting menu, and...the both of us were blown away. Every dish was delicious, along with the ambiance being just perfect.  We have dined at many Michelin star and high end restaurants and really enjoyed our time and food here. We had one other Michelin star restaurant in Athens on a different night and were not impressed at all. Aleria was our first dinner when we got to Athens and set the tone for the rest of the vacation.  Aleria was the first and best meal we had while in Greece for two weeks.More\n",

However, the pumpkin puree was mindblowing. I never experienced something different to that one. This exceptional dish...was a complete surprise in terms of taste, smell, texture. Whoever invented this dish was a true Maitre! As mentioned before, all other dishes as expected: the same high quality and standard. The staff handled it well, was attentive and keen. We really appreciated. The ambiance nice and cozy, a good concept for lights. Also the price-benefit ratio needs to be mentioned which is really a good one.

      "On arrival, the service was excellent; attentive but...relaxing. Likewise, the décor and walled garden were elegant and inviting. We plumped for the 6-course ‘Earth and Sea’ taster with accompanying Greek wine pairing, relatively confident that our first impressions would result in similarly rewarding dishes. I was arguably being cautious… the food was outstanding to a plate. As was the wine… each glass was perfectly paired and just enough detail was given by the manager/sommelier. The service remained relaxed but attentive throughout and one of the dishes (the pumpkin mousse) may be in the top three things I have ever eaten. A deep, savoury, truffley, salty bowl of joy which, despite the fact I’ve been home now for three days, is still front and centre on my mind. This place is worth the hype as well as it’s place in the Michelin Guide. Arguably, it deserves a Bib Gourmand or a star too.More\n",

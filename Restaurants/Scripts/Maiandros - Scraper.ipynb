It took a long time for a waiter to come over with menus. When he...tried to take our order, we explained the arrangement and said we would have a drink while waiting for a table on the terrace. He looked angry and had an argument with the man at the door in front of us. He then explained a table on the terrace was 40 minute wait and pressured us to order. The food was ok. Edible but the worst we had in Athens. The lamb souvlaki was chewy and the potatoes too greasy. We ordered a carafe of white wine which wasn’t great. They didn’t ask if we wanted dessert but just slapped the bill on the table as soon as we finished dinner. They had added an extra item on the bill for 3.50 euros. When we questioned whether it was water (we hadn’t ordered any) he said no. He then went through what we had ordered, ticking them off the bill and insinuating it was the 1 beer or 1 wine we had ordered (he knew it wasn’t as the word on the bill didn’t mean wine or beer). He then said ‘it must be a mistake at the till’ still without explaining what it was. I think this is likely a common ‘mistake’ that people let slide. Wouldn’t recommend or return.More\n",

Service was efficient considering there were two servers for the entire restaurant. My parents ended up chatting with the host and waiter and they were extremely nice. Souvlaki, grilled octopus, Greek salad, and kebabs all flavorful, perfectly cooked, and well-portioned. The waiter brought us complimentary chocolate mousse as well.

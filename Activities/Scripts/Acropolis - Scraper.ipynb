      "Review text is :A gorgeous view from up top, and fascinating history! Best to hire a guide. But unfortunately, what really made this place a MAJOR disappointment was the absolutely manical staff members walking around the archeological sites, trying to be incognito but with walkie talkie’s at full volume, yelling at visitors in broken English who were taking pictures and otherwise trying to enjoy themselves. These wannabe psycho cops were demanding that people delete certain photos from their phones and cameras because they were “promoting”. What does that even mean?? So someone can’t hold a can of Pepsi in a photo or wear a t-shirt with any sort of logo on it?? The most ungrateful, ridiculous display of power tripping I honestly have ever witnessed ANYWHERE in the world. It was almost like they were trying to demean and scare people just for the fun of it. Sick! The employees would stalk and harass the visitors, yelling at them and threatening to call the police, who would “take their phones” if they didn’t immediately delete the photos that these Acropolis staff members saw as being “promotional”. Not anyone (from what I saw) was doing anything obscene or remotely inappropriate, just some hugs, thumbs up, peace signs, and a few other random poses. Sure, people were excited, but what’s wrong with that? It was extremely sad to witness terrified visitors from all over the world, some who were even crying, being threatened that they would be thrown into some Greek jail for taking pictures on their vacations. Including several people who were celebrating their honeymoon!Shame on these bully Acropolis employees (who wouldn’t even identify themselves, state their position or names or show any form of ID), for actively trying to ruin tourists vacations. Especially since for many people, like myself, this is the first vacation we’ve had since the pandemic. Many traveller’s are still traumatized and extra sensitive to begin with after a very scary past couple of years. They should never be put in such a threatening and abusive situation by anyone, especially after paying their hard earned money to enter this site.These staff members are an embarrassment to the Acropolis and to Greece in general (one of the most hospitable countries in the world), and are literally biting the hands that feed them. They are clearly taking out their negativity and anger in life on innocent visitors, many of whom don’t even understand English. Disgraceful. To risk having your visit ruined by these unhinged tyrants, I recommend saving your 20 euro admission and going elsewhere. And I hope whoever controls and runs this Acropolis operation reads this review, and takes SERIOUS corrective measures. I (and others) will be posting some videos very soon on other social media platforms to let people judge the situation for themselves.\n",

The other entrance via the South slopes takes you via the Theatre of Dionysus and other smaller sites.

If you're in Athens for a few days I recommend getting the Combo ticket (only in the summer season - out of season individual tickets will actually be cheaper than the Combo).Of course the crowds are there because it's a must see when in Athens!

There are rock steps which will be very difficult in some portions, the paths can be very crowded during peak seasons so be prepared to be very aware of your surroundings.    There’s also not a ton to see when you get up there.   You want the iconic photos and the great view - but the informational signs are few and far between so you might want to consider a guide if you are interested in a deeper history dive.

Incline is steep but designed in such a way that the walk is not too challenging.Our family booked a Viator tour with Anastasia who was a faboulos history person and story teller.  Great guide.The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a mountain high above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. During ancient times the Acropolis of Athens was known also more properly as Cecropia, after Cecrops, the first Athenian king.Pericles in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the buildings whose present remains are the site's most important ones, including the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike. The Parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the Venetians during the Morean War when gunpowder being stored in the Parthenon was hit by a Venetian bombardment and exploded.Totally a must see while visiting Athens, choosing a guide is also important as you get to learn about the history of the structures.\n",

At that point it was extremely hot so definitely wake up early and go - you will be thankfulyou did!\n",

But, there is still something bad in all of this, and that is the construction works that are carried out right in the summer and at the time of the tourist season. This however gives a poorer view of the overall picture of the Acropolis during the summer. I think that the renovation work can be done during the winter, when there are not so many tourists. Also, no facilities were open also. This is a problem that all tourist countries have. That's why the lower rating at the end from my love and me.\n",

Our tour guide had to cancel last minute so we ended up touring the site on our own, which was not ideal because the history of the site and buildings comes alive through stories, not a small sign or plaque. Still an amazing visit.  There are places along the way to catch some shade and enjoy the beauty of the site. The site had much more greenery than I expected and the color of the conifers were a great contrast to the stone. Its very dusty on the Acropolis so keep that in mind as our shoes were super dusty and dirty when finished. Don’t forget to walk down to the Ancient Agora when finished.

Going early is not going to avoid any crowd at popular months unless you are queuing at 08.00. At 09.00 there was a small line to buy tickets and as we had our 5 day passes we walked straight in scanning our ticket. But were in a steady paced crowd through the Temple of Venus up to the top. The Parthenon and other structures are wonderful and we took our time strolling around the top enjoying the sites, and trying to avoid the groups of 20, 30, 40 massing at various point. I would still go though, there are opportunities for photos without people in them, you just have to be patient, time them, and be quick!By the time we went to leave the top section there was a queue 60 metres long ten people wide trying to get down while a queue three or four people wide were trying to come up. Chaos. Too late staff started to try to organise people into a narrow queue, stopped people coming up to let the crowd going down. We sat and watched the shambles and enjoyed longer time at the top. The place is a victim of its own success and needs to start limiting numbers of people. For this reason we much preferred sites like Messene or Delphi. The Odeon of Herodes Atticus was also disappointing. Perhaps apart from the stage area which looks more authentic or sympathetically restored, the seating of the theatre looks brand new and was being prepared with sound and lighting for some show. On this site I preferred the Theatre of Dionysus, smaller maybe, but more authentic, if I want to see a concert venue I can anytime. This called me to question the amount of other rebuilding going on, not restoration but new pieces combined with old in rebuilding. In years to come you wouldn’t want a replica site.\n",

It would be nice to add more places to get snacks or water but it's before anything a monument and it's really a place worth visiting.Our visit was however soured when we witnessed two employees sitting by the theatre area being extremely hostile and homophobic towards two young men trying to get a fun, dancelike picture (particularly relevant in the theatre) of one quickly lifting the other. It literally took five seconds but the employees were extremely rude, aggressive and hypocritical when confronted as they told the two men to not take \"abnormal\" pictures (and I was then told that I could get picutres with my husband because, we, unlike them, were \"normal\" - they even doubled down and said the boys were not to take pictures kissing or hugging, swapping between English and Italian... too bad we understand Italian).

The Acropolis was built by Pericles who wanted to mark the victory, and thank the gods, for the victory of the Greeks over the Persians.  It was 11,000 Greek soldiers against hundreds of thousands of Persians.  The Persians landed at the bay of Marathon, a young soldier ran to the city to spread news of the victory, and after doing so, he dropped dead.  To remember him the exact distance marks a marathon 26.2 miles.  The Acropolis took 12 years to build-all of the marble came from the mountain in the city, all of the funds from a nearby silver mine. Definitely a place to see-my wife and I had been here previously in 2010, and it was very rocky, difficult to walk on, and awkward to manoeuvre. Since then, the ancient stairs have been replaced by a wide modern walkway-extremely easy to navigate!\n",

We did engage an official tour guide on site, an older women “Vivi”, she spend 1 hour taking us around the site, took some family photos as we went and focused a lot on the “values and thinking behind the temples and Gods” linking them to the thinking of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. While her commentary was interesting tangent to the actual site she was not great at responding to our teenage girls questions (if anything was frustrated by them). The cost was 150 euros for the hour, she claimed the going rate was 30 euros per person and as a party of six we got a slight discount. When all said and done I would recommend Rick Steves self guided audio tour (he has a dedicated app) with maps and pictures to help guide you, I learnt more from this and found it far more informative and factual. Bottom line save yourself the money and go around at your own pace with Rick Steves free and well structured service for this most do tourist attraction. Also recommend visiting early morning, we arrived at 7.50am (we spent approx 90mins, then kids fatigued in heat) or late in the day to escape the July heat, it was 34c the day we visited.\n",

It was a really hot day and we were running out of water. The vending machines for water only took coins so either keep a bunch of coins with you or pack enough water when you go. Thankfully a staff pointed us to a faucet with drinkable water we can refill our bottles with near the entrance. Such a godsend since you can't leave the park once you scan your ticket to enter the Acropolis and all the drink vendors were outside. We downloaded the Free Rick Steve's (RS) Acropolis Audio Guide from the RS Europe App and used it to explore. I would highly recommend downloading it beforehand. Unfortunately,  there was very little shade at the Acropolis so I'd suggest going really early or an hour before they close so that it's not so hot. We went at noon and the heat definitely took away from the entire experience. Well worth the trek though.\n",

Download the Rick Steves Free Audio Tour of the Acropolis on your phone before heading to  the site. This was a perfectly paced walk through the site and so informative. Rick Steve’s tours are far and away the best. There is supposedly wifi at the site, but it doesn’t work so don’t rely on that to stream.3. Allow at least 20 minutes of walking time to just get to the ticket booth.2. Either wake up REALLLLLY early and be in line to buy tix/enter the park at 8am EXACTLY, or go for the last two hours that the site is open. End of day is probably best because the site starts getting super crowded by 9am-9:30am.3. Be mindful of if there are performances at the Acropolis that night, in case the regular hours are changed and the park closes early. My brother went when he thought he had two hours to explore, but ended up only getting 20 minutes for this reason. 4. Make sure you have ID so that you can receive a discounted ticket, if you qualify. 5. West shoes with grip…it’s slippery up there! 6. I would even recommend going alone or exploring somewhat alone to really take in the incredible nature of this site. I was really glad about this part of my visit. Enjoy!\n",

The streets leading to the base of the mountain were filled with cafe's and shops which made the walk peasant enough.  The fact that every street was on an upward trajectory, started to tire out the best of our group.  By the time we reached the lower gate to buy the entrance tickets, I felt completely spent,  leaving little for the additional ascent to the Parthenon.  The location, and sight of the ruins reinvigorated me and I was able to climb all the way to the top.  The going was slippery at the end due to the fact that most of the flooring and stairs/steps were marble worn smooth by centuries of use.  It was worth the effort.  Submersing into the history of this place is amazing.  Wondering how these ancient builders were able to construct anything in that location.

They told us we only could have 15 minutes in there and would not give us a discounted ticket, so we decided to visit on the back end of our trip.  The cost for entry is 20 euro.  The shining star for free if you don't want to spend 20 euro is the Areopagus, which was where they held court for mostly cases involving murder, wounding, religious matters, and arson of olive trees. Who knew that was a major issue in ancient Greece?Definitely a must stop if you have at least an hour.  Get the Rick Steves Europe tour app (free to download and play all the tours).

      "Review text is :Of course this is an important historical building and it is impressive. I'm glad I went, and I would recommend it. Once. I've done it and I have no need to ever go back. First, it is 20 euros per person to get in, and unless you also hire a licensed guide outside the gate for another 20 euros (plus tip, he reminded us several times), you won't get that much out of it. Second, it is crowded beyond belief. They really should limit the number of people on the site at any one time, but it seems the more bodies they can squeeze in the more money they get, and that seems to be the most important factor. The day we were there were 5 cruise ships in the port, and obviously they all sent huge numbers of guests here - as they should. Just not all at once. Third, all of those people cramming together make it more difficult to walk on what are some very slippery surfaces. No, they should not change the walkways. They need to preserve the historical integrity of the site. But the more crowded the walkways and steps are, the more dangerous. Fourth, there is no shade anywhere. It can get extremely hot, especially with all the rock and marble around absorbing heat. If they're okay with having scaffolding up for decades at a time, it seems they should be able to figure out a way to create some kind of shade in areas without taking away from the beauty of the site. I'm still giving it four stars because I do think people should go, and learning about the site was fascinating. But know that it will cost you quite a bit, and try to go when it's not too hot and there aren't too many cruise ships in port. Also, wear shoes that can handle slippery surfaces well.\n",

However the tourist experience could be better improved by having a clear one way circular path to visit the entire site, as it was sometimes confusing which way to go and being hustled by tourists walking in the opposite direction. Also could do with shorter descriptions of the monuments but that gave a more holistic feel of it's purpose.**** TIPS! ****- Buy one of the Skip The Line tickets beforehand. Easy to scan to get through the turnstiles - Go early 8am or 8.30 & Use the south entrance. - WEAR TRAINERS- Make a beeline right to the top to see the Acropolis. Its not that far to the top, if you're fairly nimble it'll take about 10 to 15 mins. It'll be the least busy, cooler and can take better photos. - Once done enjoy the rest of the other sites at a relaxing pace.Hint -  stray cats are around so you may want to have a few kitty treats to share with them if you want to make friends :)\n",

I had been in Athens more than 20 years ago but wasn't able to visit the Acropolis as I wasn't feeling well. It was nice to finally be able to visit after all this time. Looking at the Acropolis from ground level and the numerous hotel bars, it may seem daunting to get up to it but it really wasn't and was a gradual ascent. My colleague booked skip the queue tickets at 20€ each and we arrived just before 9am and it was pretty busy. There wasn't a massive queue at the ticket booths but didn't matter to us as we had got the tickets before hand. We headed up to the Parthenon first and did the lower slopes after. It was absolutely heaving with many tour groups around. The site is alot bigger than I thought. As we had other engagements in the late morning we did a quick wander around - as it was pretty hot by then, it would have been difficult to remain outdoors for a longer stretch regardless. The ruins were really impressive, as was the view of Athens. Recommend that you head to the little hill just in front of the Acropolis where you can get a view from a different angle. A must-visit, but do visit as early as possible to avoid the crowds (though it might be challenging!)\n",

      "Review text is :Well, I would say that if you are in Athens with reduced time, the Acropolis is a must-see on top of everything else. It's the best with a big distance over the rest. Maybe the national museum of archeology is close to the acropolis to visit in my opinion. In any case, it's the heritage of the ancient greek culture. We don't have a lot of things in a perfect-mint state from the past (not in Greece) so this place is the only one that we can say \"it's ok\". It will give you an idea of what ancient Greece was, the view of Athena (the city), and many other things. It has the Mediterranean spark that I can feel in Spain (I'm Spanish) or Italy in terms of nature. It's a great place that if you go to Athens you need to visit. Careful with the clothes. Summer can be really hot and scorching. Careful with the footwear as this is basically a bit of hiking into the mountain so comfortable and not slippery shoes. Definitely not a place to visit if it's raining as the stones are quite slippery and you may have an accident. Not children-friendly in my opinion. I saw people taking babies and leaving them on the floor (???). In general, you will enjoy the view of the Parthenon, the entrance to the acropolis, the Dionysios theater that welcomes the city, and the other ruins. There is a good spot where you can see Athens from the top and the sea. I liked it definitely. I won't spoil everything, just that is a must-see if you are there. Last advice: buy from the government site! do not use headout or similar companies, as you will pay more as we did (my bad).\n",

Another favorite is the Theater of Dionysus, built into the southern slope of the Acropolis.

Having said that the experience may vary in fun, depending on when you decide to hike up. I went there twice, pre and during the pandemic and I'll have to say that the experiences could not have been more different. No cues, unfriendly and egoistic tourists standing in your way with selfy sticks or stealing stones from the side was very nice. Of course I hope that we are done with Covid for good this summer, but in this case I recommend to wake up early and take your chance to be among the first people up there, as the Akropolis is great, but many people aren't.\n",

      "Review text is :Of course...when in Athens, visit the Acropolis.  Obvious right.  So it really comes down to recommendations on how to improve  your visit.  Similar to many historic sites or ancient ruins, I think the following tips will improve most visits to the Acropolis: 1) Do some research before you go.  Go online a read or watch some tours or historic videos on Ytube.  This will help give context and detail to what you're seeing because the information once atop is very limited (mainly talks about restoration efforts)2) Go early in the day.  We were visiting in the winter, so going early wasn't nearly as important to avoid crowds or heat like it would be in the summer but we were able to take great photos with absolutely no one in them. 3)Buy an audio guide or download one on your phone ahead of time or better yet, support a local guide and hire them for a tour4) Go the Acropolis museum as an extension to an Acropolis visit.  It's a nominal fee, but holds a large amount of the original marbles that were excavated and/or preserved from the site. I would go here first if you don't have a guide or don't have an understanding of the Acropolis, but would go after if you do.5) Buy the Combo ticket rather than just the Acropolis ticket if you're spending a few days in Athens.  This will let you into the Agora and almost every other historic site in the city for just a few extra Euros.6) Pack what you need - on our visit, once we passed the admission gate there were no services of any kind (food, drink) other than toilets.7) Take the time to visit/go down the south side of the Acropolis to view the theatres/odeons that were built into the hill side.\n",

There are two entrances - the main entrance to the west, and the south entrance. Both require a walk to the top, over sometimes uneven ground, but you can retrace history along the way, and the views from the top make the climb worth every step. You can do a quick visit in under an hour, but you should allow two hours if you really want to explore and take in the sites at the top and on the surrounding slopes. TIP #1: You can buy your tickets online by scanning the QR code on the signs at the entrance. The price is 10 Euros for a single-use ticket or 30 Euros for a combo ticket, which is good for admission to several historic sites for 5 days. If you plan to visit multiple sites, I recommend the combo ticket. When we visited in January, there was no line and no need to spend extra money on “skip the line” tickets advertised by third-party sites. TIP #2: There are no restrooms on top or along the walk up, so plan ahead. There are free public restrooms just outside the south entrance. They are slightly hidden and down some stairs,\n",

The word acropolis is from the Greek words akron, \"highest point, extremity\" and polis, \"city\"). The term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropolises in Greece. While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles (c. 495–429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the buildings whose present remains are the site's most important ones, including the Parthenon.  While one must climb to the top of the Acropolis (no elevator, etc.), it is not even close to as difficult as the climb was to the Acropolis in Rhodes.It was truly wonderful to see the Parthenon, Temple of Erechtheum and other structures.  And yes, there was a cat.We also saw the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, a stone Roman theater structure located on the southwest slope of the Acropolis of Athens.  It was built in 161 AD.\n",

      "Review text is :Awesome experience at the Acropolis! First, I would like to state that I think my former jerk of a husband deleted my original profile filled with awesome reviews.  So I guess I am starting on a blank page here.Went with the new husband to honeymoon in Athens Greece. What a better place to start a new life together than romantic Athens, which saw the birth of civilization!Went to the Acropolis twice during our trip.  The first time we had jst arrived in Greece and we were both exhausted. Definitely recommend going when you are well rested and have plenty of time as it's quite a climb up.  We took the wrong way a number of times during our first time here, and when we arrived, we only had about 30 minutes to explore so we decided to come back the following day also.The next day, we were able to find a better more straightforward path.  The Acropolis and Parthenon are quite an experience! We entered through the main gates, which are quite magnificent.  We explored the Parthenon which is being heavily restored, and saw the different temples - mostly of Athena, Erechtheion temple, temple of Athena Nike, as well as the guards in typical Greek uniforms which perform various duties with the Greek flag.  The area surrounding the Parthenon and the various temples is a bit of rough terrain so bring comfy shoes to navigate and get around. Luckily for us, it didn't rain during either of our visits, but it can be treacherous with rain.  This was definitely one of the most memorable sites and experiences in Athens.  The Acropolis and Parthenon can also be viewed from most of the city given that it's so high up.  It is light at night which is absolutely beautiful. Reading the various explanations throughout the site is worthwhile, given that it helps understand the different eras and restoration cycles of the site, and helps understand its history as well which is significant.  Tour guides are plentiful throughout the site.  It is important to note that tickets are 20 Euro during high season and only 10 during low season. We bought the 7 excursion package for 30 Euro which we ultimately didn't end up using in full, wouldn't recommend it as some of the sites are far removed and hard to get into, and about the same price during low season. The theater right by the Acropolis is also worth taking a look at, Odeon of Herodeion which during high season has shows.  There is a small shop located at the bottom, we didn't go in. To note, there is no food at this site, so do recommend taking water particularly during the summer months.  If there is one thing you do in Athens when you visit - visit the Acropolis and the Parthenon!\n",

I would advise a morning visit would be better as I think it gets busier in the afternoon.  A good option would be to get one of the hop on hop off bus tours and get off here as it saves you a walk up and down.  Having said that, there are some lovely tavernas on the way up or down for coffees etc.  The site itself is amazing but definitely wear trainers as some of the surfaces are slippy and rough.

In the end I paid an extra entrance also for Acropol, taking pictures. The areal is big. Luckily, there are some vending machines with water. Panthenon is the most famous and the most preserved building upon them all. It will be probably a highlight of your visit. If you want to buy tickets, buy them online, even before tourniquets for entrance at the place. Queue at ticket shop at the place is always a long one.\n",

It's sad to see how much damage and decay has befallen the Acropolis, but it's still a magnificent place. It can get very crowded though, even in the off-season, as you'd expect for such a popular worldwide destination. If you have the time, I recommend you go to one of the entrances and buy your tickets the day before, and then get to the Acropolis first thing when they open in the morning. It was very relaxed and quiet when we visited at 8am but was getting very busy when we were leaving around 10am. There's a multi-site ticket available for not much more than the single-admission - well worth getting if you have time to visit more of the ancinet sites of Athens. Make sure to also visit the nearby Acropolis museum - it's a gorgeous modern building and it houses a lot of sculptures, panels and artifacts from the Acropolis.\n",

      "Review text is :TL;DR version: As one other reviewer posted here, visiting the Acropolis is more stressful than it is enjoyable, romantic, or fun.While the Acropolis is beautiful and certainly worth the effort to climb and enjoy, the staff there make it incredibly difficult for visitors to do so. The flow of traffic is somewhat difficult to navigate, and many visitors have audio tours in their ears. When they happen to wander in the wrong direction, the staff attempt to steer them back on course and have to do so quite loudly or harshly — atop of patch of very slippery marble. Disappointingly, the staff try their hardest to control the way people take photos, and this is where we ran into trouble. A rather overzealous woman stationed at the southeast corner of the Parthenon shouted at us from across the marble field to delete our photos “out of respect for the site.” Unfortunately, the fact that she had screamed so loudly to us meant that every single person in the area had heard the commotion and turned to watch the (non-)drama unfold.After we approached the woman (it took a minute or so to actually walk over to where she was), we asked her “Which photo was the problem so that we know not to do it again.” In the end, after reviewing our photos, she apologized (we had not crossed a barrier, we did not pick anything up, and were not climbing anything; it should also be noted that pictures may be taken of all the structures without flash). It made for a very awkward and uncomfortable experience, and we departed from the top of the hill not shortly after (due in part to simply being tired).Unfortunately, it is now painfully clear the awful reputation of the guards at the Parthenon is one they deserve to have — they are, for all intents and purposes, mall cops. Not even one minute after our collision with this woman, we heard her whistle again at another group of people. Athens has been an absolute joy so far, home to some incredibly nice people, and all of our interactions at other attractions, supermarkets, and retail shops have been lovely. I’ve been able to practice my Greek as much as I can, and I’ve loved every second of it. It is a shame that the staff at the Acropolis are so hyper-focused on fighting the wrong battles. I saw many children climbing the ruins, people slipping on marble, and elderly persons in need of assistance with no guards around to offer any. Also, the rather large guided tours clog the entryways (particularly at the Propylaea), making the Acropolis a rather precarious site. In my eyes, efforts could certainly be made to improve safety over policing those who had not been doing anything wrong. If you are expecting the same level of kindness or professionalism one would see at any museum across the EU, at the Colosseo, Palatino, Les Invalides, or the Catacombs of Paris, forget about it.\n",

When you're under 25 the ticket is free.\n",

There is nowhere to buy food or drink but there are watering taps and toilets at the top. Check before you drink as the heat turns the water into bath water temperatures. We entered from the main gate and exited through the theatre (not the amphitheatre which is still in use) and we’re greater by a string of restaurants with cold water and cold beer. Unfortunately the experience was tarnished by a NATO delegation doing a media tour. There was no prior notification ( I understand that for security reasons but simply stating that it’s open later would suffice.) We arrived at half past 8 and had to wait in the searing sunshine until 11:00 without any access to toilets as they were also locked, before the last VIP’s sauntered down the path to the exit to much boos and hand clapping.

From her extensive knowledge of archeology and history, she fast- tracked all the important information that I needed to know without reading every placard in the Acropolis Museum. It can be overwhelming to be in Athens in the summer heat, but enthusiastically and energetically, Faye lead me to the great sites and her guidance was invaluable!!

There were guides outside the Acropolis offering tours and we joined up with another couple to pay 20 euros per person. We found it well worth it.The ticket for the Acropolis is 20 euros, but for 30 euros you can get access to a few other sites around the city. We did the 30 euros and regretted it as we didn't end up using it (we only had a day in Athens). Also, it doesn't include access to the Acropolis museum (which we wrongly assumed) and that's an additional 10 euros. The museum is really great - nicely designed space to learn more about the history and see the original artifacts.\n",

A gorgeous sunny morning in low season made it a perfect time for visiting, having it practically to ourselves.Entering through the magnificent soaring Propylaia we admired the gorgeous Temple of Athena Nike, constructed in the 420s BCE to celebrate Athenian victories over the Persians. Even though the Erechtheion Caryatids are replicas, it is a great sight infused with myth and mystery. Later we saw the graceful originals in the brilliant Acropolis Museum.A Statue of Athena Promachos was a striking monument in antiquity. It honoured the Protectress in gratitude for victories in the Persian Wars and stood about 9 metres high.  What can be seen today of the Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia comprises elements of foundations and walls. It is likely that the Cult of Artemis commenced on the Acropolis in the 6th century BCE.Walking around the Parthenon was marvellous yielding many fabulous views of the stunning Temple. The Pentelic marble changed appearance as the morning light progressed. It was easy picking out the modern segments in the columns, all part of preservation and renovation that has been underway for decades. On the way to the Theatre of Dionysus we first gazed at the wonderful Herod Atticus Odeon, where many famous artists have performed, including Maria Callas in 1957.On the route we saw some notable remains of ancient remains - Stoa of Eumenes II, Byzantine Cistern and Temple of Asclepius and Hygieia.\n",

Would 100% recommend going to the Acropolis museum before you go up as you learn everything there is to know about this magnificent structure and its history. This makes the difference from looking at an old marble monument to using your imagination looking at every Parthenon frieze with it telling a story. The only downside was the scaffolding as they are doing restoration works however rather a Parthenon with scaffolding than no Parthenon at all.We entered by the gates nearest to Acropoli metro station and got in for free as it was Oxi Day (28th Oct). We spent around 2 hours here but you can take as long or as short as you like. The views of Athens once up there are incredible with sights of Piraeus and Glyfada on one side and the white washed walls of Athens all around on the other. Please note that the attractions included on the €30 ticket are all FREE every Sunday between November - March. We would have paid the €20 entrance fee to see it though as it is just spectacular and a must if you are in Athens, it just so happened that the day we had planned to see it on was a Greek national holiday so we had saved €40 and counted our blessings! The €30 combined ticket is definitely worth paying for if you are interested in the Temple of Zeus, the Acropolis Museum, the Archeological Museum and so on. However if you are there to just see the Acropolis, go on a Sunday between November to March and spend the money you have saved on a meal in a local restaurant around the Acropolis and a well deserved drink! *WHEELCHAIR USERS OR MOBILITY ISSUES PLEASE READ* ———To finish I’d like to add that I had dislocated my knee during the week we were in Athens and still managed to hobble to the top with a good partner and a slow pace.  There IS a lift for wheelchair access but it has been suspended as works for its replacement are in progress (this was emailed to me 4th November 2020).

I could have done without the incessant, ear shattering squeals. That aside, the site is absolutely a must-see in Athens.\n",

Incredible amount of history here and you can just imagine yourself here a few thousand years ago. Really gives us an insight into how life might have been. The route around the site takes us around and down to the old theatre of Dionysus, which is well preserved from 500 years BC, which was really interesting and gave us an idea about cultural life around that time. The orchestra was an important part of performances even then, and apparently there was an annual festival for poets and musicians to show their talents in a competition. There was an example of a bust made in honour of one if the participants even though he didn't win, but must have been very good, Menendere. There were hundreds of seats (5000), in the auditorium, so the concerts must have been good. They listened to plays, comedies and tragedies and satire.

The first 20 minutes is a hot hike up to the theatre of Dionysus and then to the Propylaea. Then through the Propylaea you will see the pantheon in front.We were there at about 1030am and there we some shady spots. The status of the maidens in Erechtheum was beautiful. Toward the far end is an amazing view point of the city of Athens. There was toilets half way up near the theatre of Dionysus as well as adjacent to the pantheon.An amazing place!

Teaching the ticket kiosk staff to recognize the acropolis's own online ticket voucher would also be a good start. If you really want to go overboard, why not suggest to your staff that paying visitors are essential and should be made welcome, rather than a nuisance.

After 10 minutes a lady tells us we have to walk faster and when we reached the top we  were told we had to walk immediately back downstairs.The way the people were asked to go downstairs was not friendly. It was quite aggressive. The people were treated like cattle and I really couldn't believe my eyes. We had to walk so near to each other because they wanted everybody out at 20:00 o'clock. Walking with so many people so near to each other not taking into account that there is the corona virus.The stairs are quite slippery and my sister got nervous because of the workers yelling at the people. She fell off the stairs with her 2 year old son in het arms. My nephew of 6 years old also fell off the stairs and the same happened to a man  walking behind us. So I paid 20 euros to go through a gate to be told they will close and then to be treated I a way that was far from human.

We picked up the combi tickets of €30 per adult (the children went free as under 18 and British passports) the previous evening at Hadrian's library. No que which was brilliant. Got to the Acropolis via the South eastern gate at 9am. Skipped the ticket ques(hurray!!). Walked through the entrance check barriers. Got up the hill and visited all the 8 structures within an hour and 10 minutes, with several little water breaks and several photos at each spot.

We see something beautiful, something eternal, something that speaks through every century to us. So many days and nights and beautiful strolls around the Acropolis. Smelling the hot air, watching performances in Herodotus Theatre and having the Acropolis as a crown, looking up in hope. Hope for eternity and beauty. Do visit but also experience as an Athenian would; stroll down the many sokakia, eat a fish or meat \"pikilia\" (tapas plate) at Dioskouri, stroll in all laziness around Dionysiou Areopagitou, go to Psyri for a coffee that lasts for hours. Enjoy and be happy.\n",

I will just give two small bits of advice:  Firstly go to this place with a guide or join a highly regarded conducted tour. I was on a group tour, and we had a wonderful guide.  He gave us an enormous amount of information, and regaled us with numerous anecdotes.  You may go only once to this place in your life, don't try to save money by not using a guide!  My second bit of advice: it is positively dangerous to go here with inappropriate footwear.  The ground is very uneven, and there is a bit of climbing (and descending!  coming down is more dangerous than going up!)  I saw two people slip and fall.  We went on a bright sunny day, so everything was dry.  On a wet day, it would be dangerous even with good shoes.  So take care!\n",

      "Review text is :The Acropolis in Athens is more than just the Parthenon. There are several buildings, temples and theaters on this world-famous hill.Of course the Parthenon stands out and is the most famous of the hilltop buildings of the Acropolis. But don't rush up there, there's lots else to see and wander around.We came in through the south entrance close to the Acropolis Museum. A sunny day, no lines at at all at around 10.30am. A better choice than the main entrance.It's a nice stroll going up to the Parthenon. Some really nice views on the way. And you will also pass the very impressive Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus, something you might miss out on, when you enter from the main gate.The biggest crowds are just a the entrance to the top, around the Statue of Athena Promachos and Propylaea.Once you're on top, you'll be able to really take in the amazing views of Athens. A very large town, suprisingly big. The Parthenon of course is the heart up here and an eye-catcher. But take your time to wander around and to visit the other sight. Most visitors spend maybe half an hour or so. Pic, Selfie....and they are on their way. It's a shame, because the whole area here is full of history and wonderful architecture. Even though hugely popular, it's well worth a visit. It's busy for a reason.\n",

      "Review text is :The Acropolis is a must see for every visitor to Athens – it’s said to be the most important ancient site in the western world. If possible, go first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds. We went mid-afternoon on the day we arrived in Athens as we were leaving the city again early the next morning. It was not the best thing for us to do for when we approached the entrance to the site we were swamped by hundreds of tourist groups talking in very loud voices and pushing and shoving. So it’s better that you enter at the east entrance near the Theatre of Dionysis as tour groups don’t use this entrance. The ancient temples on top of the hill are gradually being restored. The grandest is the Parthenon, dedicated to Athena Parthenos, goddess embodying the power and prestige of the city. Built in 438BC, it is the largest Doric temple ever completed in Greece and the only one built of white pentelic marble. Restoration of this magnificent structure is ongoing and unfortunately scaffolding is ever-present. Other temples are also undergoing facelifts and most of the original sculptures and friezes have been moved to the new Acropolis Museum and replaced with casts. Tour groups start arriving around 9am so if you can get there earlier you get a head-start. Wear sturdy shoes as the area around the site is uneven, stony and slippery. If you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'Helpful' button; those of us who write reviews love to get them and it motivates us to do more to assist you in your holiday planning.\n",

      "Review text is :My father lived in Athens for 2 months back in the 70s and I was interested to visit the country first hand myself.  I found my first visit spell-binding, very unique and grand, but the temple of the gods was derelict. What was obvious when I went there was the country was falling apart. Lots of grand old buildings graffitied with political slogansMy perspective of Greece was always a Euro football win in circa 2002, and bearded philosophical artistic people, like the ones I met on my degree, so was keen to meet the greeks in there own country.The country much like downtown Rome has remanence of Byzantine empires and a legacy of greatness which was in the center of the greek people. I was fascinated by the things id heard from the city and went to the Acropolis on the second day. How will the Plato book I received make sense, compared to the architecture - or the mythology I studied as a child? I was not disappointed this was the place the wrestlers, the gladiators, and the fighters. It is an iron age fort, a palace to the kings and homer once spoke about this in nietczhes 'birth of tragedy', built to defend the royalty from invaders, it has strong pillars made from stone, a grand entrance and is very high up.\n",

There were only a few other people there, so we took our time and wandered around the site, taking it all in. It was delightful!  We actually managed to get some photos without other tourists in them!  We saw the imposing Parthenon ahead of us (covered in scaffolding) and headed past the Temple of Athena Nike and on to the far side wall.  Looking over, we had a perfect view of the Odeon (Theatre) of Herodes Atticus below.  Continuing on, we saw the Theatre of Dionysus and the New Acropolis Museum below.  The lookout at the very back provided a beautiful view of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch, and the city below.  We watched the sun set over the Parthenon and then made our way to the Erechtheion with its magnificent Caryatid statues.  It was a truly magical experience!\n",

I only wish that the construction was a lot further along so that I can see more of its previous splendor.  However, what's left of it is still cool to see and experience.  I didn't research the venue before my visit but because of how truly great the structures were, it encouraged me to educate myself on the subject afterward.  It made me wonder why the restoration was taking so long; why the roofs have all blown off; what the space was originally used for; and the list goes on.As one of the main attractions of Athens, it makes me wonder why it closes so early (3pm).  Even if it's for safety reasons (the grounds are very uneven), surely they can extend hours to 5pm.  NOTE:  My friend and I got there at 8am and had the place to ourselves for a solid hour until all the tour groups started coming in in droves.If history or architecture is not your thing but you were dragged to the Acropolis by family, then at least enjoy the 360 degree view of Athens.\n",

When traveling in February and March there is no need to book online skip the line tickets as it’s not so busy especially if you went early morning. The attraction opens up at 8:30 in the morning. And if you need a guide you can hire a lovely lady on spot at the attraction site. (Although she did ask for the hefty sum of 100 euros). We ended up getting the 30 euro tickets that included entry to multiple touristic attractions within the city, with the exception of the Athens museum and the Olympic stadium. I would highly recommend purchasing it if you’re doing the one day Athens tour. At the top,  the view of Athens is breath taking and you can even catch a glimpse of the temple of Zeus below.I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes that have good grip on the ground as the steps are incredibly slippery since they are made out of marble. If with kids, pay extra attention as no fence around the edge. There are security guards everywhere though.\n",

(2) Read up on the Acropolis online and download a map of the Acropolis on your mobile, before your visit. You don't need a tour guide. (3) if you are visiting Greece during summer like we did, keep in mind it is going to be very hot. Carry water and use sun cream. Proper walking shoes is a must since you have to climb stairs to reach the site. The climb is easy. No worries on that at all. (4) visit Acropolis in the evening, after 5.30 pm so that you can see the Parthenon lighted up. Also a good idea to escape the heat. (5) Buy a ticket online in advance, to beat the queue. Buy either a solo ticket or a combo ticket which covers Acropolis plus other  historical sights of AthensThe visit to the Acropolis would take one and a half to two hours. Amazing to think how the Greek built a city on a hill, with such imposing structures with huge columns and beams,  centuries ago\n",

As the other reviews state, wear comfortable shoes because its quite a bit of walking/climbing and the terrain is uneven. The site is also very exposed to sunlight, so don’t forget a hat and/or sunscreen. Also, there are quite a few people outside of the park who will try to put bracelets on your arm for “free”. They are not free and it’s a really awkward situation. My advice is either say no and keep moving or plan on bringing a euro or two per bracelet (which are actually very cute).\n",

It may seem just like pillars if you go without a guide and do not get the background of the place but the history is very interesting and the views are what you will not get from anywhere else in the city.Enjoy your trip with this, walk slowly and make some stops along the way and for sure you will be fine and will be able to go up the hill.\n",

(There is a discount for disabled people and their one companion.) He took me as close as possible to the chair lift that goes to the elevator.  Without that you are looking at what would for me have been an impossible climb up hundreds of rough uneven stone flights of steps.  The lift is a platform that slowly ascends up the long stairway.  Those stairs are shallow and doable if you can walk at all.  When you get to the top of that you then are taken into an industrial cage elevator that ascends the vertical cliff.  This elevator is NOT for the faint of heart; in fact I was asked in broken English if I had any heart problems.  I am severely claustrophobic but this elevator, being an open gauge cage, did not bother me at all.  It takes you in your chair slowly up the face of that cliff and when you roll out, facing the magnificent parthenon, and slowly roll past the 7 maidens of the temple, you will find you cannot catch your breath because of the spectacular scale and beauty before you.  Pictures fail, words fail, nothing can prepare you for the spirit and aura of this place.  The views are incredible- all of Athens, Lycabettus hill, churches and mosques, the entire Agora, Mars Hill, the far mountains, even the coast on a clear day.  It was difficult to navigate up at the top- much of the terrain is very rough even for my sturdy chair.  Even where you can navigate the chair, prepare to have your kidneys rattled.  But I am so so so grateful to the extremely helpful and encouraging staff, my family, and my knowledgable driver for making this possible for me.  It more than exceeded anything I could have imagined.\n",

As we were exploring a storm came in and washed us literally off the Acropolis, but it just added to our adventure.Our last day in Greece, we went back in the morning, it was gray and dreary, but we took pictures that turned out to be amazingly beautiful. I am not a photographer but the light appears to have been perfect for the pictures.  It actually snowed while we were at the top!

We also thought it ironic that the disabled elevator seems itself to be poorly signed and up a considerable climb (unless we missed something).There are around a dozen separate parts to the site and it would seem tailor made for an audioguide. There isn't one though and you have to make do with the static signs (in english and greek). A good suggestion on here was to download an 'unofficial' one beforehand but there really should be their own one, as seen after all at the Panathenaic stadium for example.

With our Rick Steves guide book in tow, we decided to take on the monument without a tour guide. (& I’m glad we went this route as being in a tour group just looked like a hassle.) We found it fairly easy to navigate around, & while there were informative plaques throughout, we opted for the descriptions in our book instead. The massive crane inside the main structure was an unfortunate eyesore, but I believe they are currently working on a preservation/restoration project. The views of the city were spectacular though. The ground was very uneven throughout & even slippery in some places, so be sure to wear appropriate shoes.

      "Review text is :On our shore excursion trip to and from Athen’s cruise port, we took bus, train, subway and walk to Acropolis.1. A couple looks like from Morocco approached us with a widely opened map. We were also having a small map of how to get to the hill of Acropolis from a nearby Subway station. Since we took an opposite direction ( counterclockwise) we had to look around. A decently attired husband asked me something in English. I thought he was going to help me. Instead he put his body close to me, then his wife started to say something. My wife immediately pushed me aside away from the couple. I was saved from pickpocket.2. On the way back we took a train from Acropolis STN. The train car gradually became full and just two stations before Marathon stadium (a big event at the stadium) it was so full as all pax bodies touched the others. When the train stopped one station before the stadium, my wife suddenly pulled my arm and got out of the car. I followed my wife and stood on the platform. Surprisingly, there was an old Greek (?) man standing by just next to me. I felt a bit strange, but I chased my wife who already inside of another car. I pulled my wife’s arm and brought her back in the same original car. There was the same old man next to me back in the car. Within a minute, a lady in front of us talked to me with Greek accent English (similar accent to my Greek student during my US college time) which somewhat made sense so I replied. Very soon the train stopped at the Marathon stadium - all crowded people got off. We two were left in the train soon arrived in the final destination and walked back to the cruise terminal. I became thirsty and picked up one beer can and tried to pay for the can of beer, I’d noticed, then, that my small coin holder from left hand side jean of front pocket is gone! A bit lucky it had only less than 20 euros. How smart the thief was amazingly. This was one of the funniest pickpocket experiences. The man had his hand in my jean pocket while I was standing at platform!Better prepared for pickpocket! After this incident I attached a string for a coin holder.Acropolis was the same condition of my previous visit a few months before the Athen Summer Olympics ant this place is for only one visit - 10 euros each. Note that washroom are available without entering the gate.\n",

The best part was going in November when the weather was beautiful (60s) and the admission is half price (10 EU) with little in the way of lines.  The Acroplid seemed to have its own set of feral cats and dogs to greet you.\n",

We entered by walking up a very long steep climb past the amphitheater and then up to the top. It was good exercise for those who are looking for something more strenuous, but maybe a little steep if you are not prepared or able to make a long climb. There may be better ways to get to the top especially if you are going by tour bus. The ruins were beautiful and the views from the top were spectacular. This is a place that i would go again and again, it just tells such a great story about Greek civilization. They are doing a lot of restorative work at the top but it didnt bother our ability to see what was there and use our imagination for what wasnt.

Definitely bring water and if it's hot, bring a hat.  Try to arrive as soon as possible and leave yourself a lot of time.

Definitely a must see if you plan on visiting Athens but try and avoid the hot times of the day and most of the crowds.  Early morning or late afternoon is best. It is a long climb up but totally doable - there are plenty of places to rest so take your time - venture off the path to get a birds eye view of the Odeon.  Once you go up the stairs - be careful climbing over the tourist groups who just stop and sit on the steps - past the Monument of Agrippa and through the magnificent Propylaea, you are greeted by the magnificent Parthenon.  You can see the restoration that has been happening as this is shown as the white marble.  Wear shoes that can grip the ground and try not to walk on parts of the path that are marble as they are very slippery - find the sides of the path or the gaps with lots of pebbles. The toilet block is basic but adequate and the water from the dispenser outside is refreshing. The former museum has now been emptied and its treasures now reside in the New Acropolis Museum. The Caryatids on site are copies and most of the originals are in the New Museum which is at the bottom of the Acropolis before you enter and start the climb. Do some research before you go - this place just begs to be admired but respect it by not climbing over the ropes or smoking which a lot of tourists seem to do until the officials start blowing whistles.  Also - please do not touch the marble columns - they are not magic and you will not get a thrill!\n",

Of course, things will be very different in season. I also did find the climb up the hill to be very easy for a reasonably fit person. The site itself is very impessive, but I would take a guide if I can suggest, because there is not much of explanations and the ones which are present, are quite limited and cover mostly the architectural part of the monuments, but won't tell you much about the mythology side. As for me, the mythology is equally, if not even more exciting. :)  Don't just go straight up the hill and away, walk also around it as there you will see even more interesting sights. And make sure to visit the Acropolis museum - it's a separate ticket, but it will help you to understand, what you see. And it's not a big exibition, so it won't take much of your time. Enjoy!\n",

This does NOT include entry to the museum. The sites remain unchanged with workmen everywhere and many areas cordoned off. The scaffolding is still everywhere and it remains unchanged over 25 years of visiting this site (do the restorations already guys) and makes photography sans scaffolding difficult. Very important women watch with eagle eyes over the rope boundaries, blowing whistles with glee if a hapless tourist wanders off a designated path. Make sure you see everything because if you exit the Acropolis you cannot use your ticket again and must buy another. The walk around the mountain is well worth it, with hidden gems signposted showing glimpses of the past magnificence this bustling acropolis was. Sites like the bronze forge, the well, Dionysius' theatre, the statue Grove etc are all there to see, but, again, scaffolding and repair works - understandable, but a very long process... definitely worth a visit, especially if you haven't been there before.\n",

It's worth the extra 10 Euros. The terrain is steep and uneven in places, so wear comfortable shoes. Especially on top of the Areopagus Hill which has a very smooth, slippery surface at the top.

Wear reasonable walking shoes as the stones leading to the area gets slippery even when its not wet.When we there on 14 Sep, it was pretty scorching hot but windy. The kind of wind that will blow away not just hats and caps, tourists inclusive . Quite a number of tourists slipped and fell. We did too while trying to cross to another spot.Reminder not to climb onto any part of the ruins as this is not allowed supposedly to continue with preservation efforts which is understandable of course. There will be staffs roaming to ensure and tell u to refrain from doing so, using their whistle on hand.Good luck with the visiting and enjoy loads of instagrammable moments!\n",

      "Review text is :AcropolisAthensPersonal Tips for Getting the Most from the Acropolis721651045Tip #1- Buy your tickets on-line from the official \"TAP\" site and not from the myriad of other on-line sellers. This will save you $$ and still allow you to skip the ticket queue. Tip #2- Despite this ticket being valid for 5 days, it only allows access to the Acropolis and slopes ONE TIME. This means you cannot make multiple entries on different days to visit the other sites on the same ticket. Therefore, plan on seeing all of the various sites and museums during the same visit!Tip #3- Hire a good guide. A knowledgeable guide (who you can understand), helps to make the Acropolis 'come alive', otherwise, it's just another picturesque 'pile of rubble', especially if you have children or teens in your groupTip #4- wear good solid walking shoes. The grounds are uneven and stony and hurt your feet if you are not wearing thick soled walking shoes. Also for those with gimpy knees, bring a walking cane/staff. There are a lot of stairs and many have a vertical rise that is relatively high that can put a lot of stress on unsupported weak/suspect knees.\n",

A couple of things to note:- Enter via the south slope so you don’t forget to see Dionysiou’s theatre- Entry for adults during summer season (which ends November 1st) is 20 euros. During summer season it might be interesting to buy the ticket that includes entry to the ancient agora, roman agora, zeus’ temple, hadrian’s library and couple of other sites for 30 euros. Acropolis + Ancient Agora is already 28 euros, so if you’re planning to see more ancient sites it could be a deal. During winter season everything is half price, so then individual tickets are cheaper.- The acropolis might have quite the waiting line during summer. You can buy the combined ticket at any other site that’s included in the ticket. Doing this might save you some time. The Acropolis and Ancient Agora have the biggest queues (they’re also the two attractions that are worth it the most)- Don’t trust Tripadvisor’s opening hours. Check the Acropolis site to be sure. I arrived around 4pm in order to take pictures during daytime, catch the sunset and then take some pictures of the place as it gets lit up by night, but it closed at 6pm (this was a Saturday)- On your way to the Acropolis (or another ancient site in Athens), you might bump into some happy guys shouting “hakuna matata” and talking about a reggae festival. They will try to “give” you a bracelet, saying that it’s a gift, after which they will try to get money for it. If you want to buy a bracelet, go with the flow. If not, you will now see them coming from a mile away.\n",

      "Review text is :I scoured the Internet for info on an Athens Pass/Card/multi site/Combi Ticket and this is what I learned.You can spend 20 euros to see the 5+ temples/amphitheaters on the Acropolis (Parthenon, Temple Dionysus, Odeon Herodes Atticus, Temple Athena Nike, Erechtheum) or for a fee / cost / charge / of 30 euros you can see all the Acropolis sights plus  Hadrian’s library, Ancient agora, Roman Agora, Zeus Olympian Temple, Aristotle’s school Leikion, Stoa of attalos, and the cemetery kerameikos,  You can also get the 30 euro multi site / combi ticket/pass from any of these less busy sites and then skip the line to buy the ticket when you visit Acropolis because you already have the ticket. Kids are free (even foreigners from outside the EU) but they still need a ticket to enter the sites. Hours are 8 am - 6 pm in Winter and tickets become less expensive starting in November. I tried to buy tickets in advance but was unable to online so I bought the ticket at the Acropolis. Also I did a lot of research on a bus/ archaeology multi site combi ticket and discovered its more expensive to purchase them this way and the pick up points are farther away from the Acropolis. There was No line at the south entrance ticket office at 9:00, but it got busy by 9:15 am when tours began to arrive. On the north slope it is shady and not busy, because there is nothing significant to see there. The South slope area is really busy with the Temple Dionysus and Odeion Herodes Atticus there. These are both Amphitheater areas where lots of people can sit and watch  a performance but the Temple of Dionysus is in disrepair and no longer in use. The  Odeion Herodes Atticus is beautiful and you can only enter if you are watching a performance but you can see the old walls and seating from inside the Acropolis area looking down to the stage, or from outside the acropolis gate looking up to the seating area.By 9:30 am in late October the Acropolis was busy but the crowds were much less by 3 pm each day. The weather was in the 70’s while we were there.None of the museums are included in the 30 euro multi site pass. There are a lot of street vendors surrounding the Acropolis sellin food drinks and souvenirs. You cannot take food inside the Acropolis. The area is very lively at night with street performers and vendors selling glow in the dark toys for kids.I have attached a photo of the 7 sites included for 30 euros and a map of where they are located.if you plan to see two other sites beside the Acropolis, you will save money by buying the multi site ticket.\n",

I had read a lot of blogs, reviews and tops before going. I set off later then I had planned about 8:30 am instead of 7:30am. However, due to it be shoulder season I found that it was not that busy at all when I arrived. I was staying in the Center of Athens and walked there from my accommodation. The walk is not as bad as I had thought after reading all of the reviews and didn’t take long at all! Once up there, there is a viewing place you can walk up and take some lovely photos. I did this first and then went to buy my ticket. Did not have to wait in a line for a ticket and I bought the €30 ticket for all 7 major sites. I was leaving Acropolis not that all after 10am and it was getting fairly busy. So my top tip is make sure you arrive before 10am during shoulder season. Otherwise all was well and not too crowded for taking pictures and what not!\n",

The climb is via many steps but many far less mobile than us managed the ascent to the Parthenon and temples at the summit - and were rewarded with some memorable views, even with scaffolding. We echo advice we were given to visit the Acropolis Museum before this trip as there is a chance to see many of the original artifacts (rather than the replicas on the site itself) and to learn about their long history through well-labelled notes.

Looking down onto the Theatre of Herod Atticus was a bit disappointing as they seemed to be setting up for a show and there were lots of lights and modern items ruining the view. At the Parthenon there was scaffolding at the front and other construction work going on. There are some wonderful views of the city from the top.

My first visit was in 1983 and I was underwhelmed and last in 2019 and I was again underwhelmed although overwhelmed by cruise ship day trippers. Viewed from afar and it’s a different story. From Philopappou Hill the view is amazing the scale of the acropolis and the skills involved building it come into context. The scaffolding is also less visible and the day trippers no more than ants.\n",

      "Review text is :When we think about Athens we automatically think about the Acropolis and the Parthenon. The Acropolis is the dominant hill and the Parthenon among other historical buildings proudly stand on the top of a flat rock.The Acropolis is more than the Pantheon, you can see the ruins of the Propylia, the temple of Athena Nika and the Erechtheion as well.If you visit Athens, it is a most to visit this place at least once in your lifetime. It is the best historical site in terms of actual standing structure. From the top, walk around and look down at the city. Beautiful views.My suggestions:1.\tSkip the lineBuy a multi-site ticket at another attraction and pass the ticket booth at the Acropolis.You can go to one of the following less crowded attractions first: Ancient Agora, Roman Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Temple of Olympian Zeus, Kerameikos, Aristotle’s SchoolSo when you get to the Acropolis ticket booth you do not need to do the line-up! To me, the difference in price was totally worth it.2.\tVisit the Acropolis Museum firstUnfortunately you can’t skip the line at the museum but it is a good way to see the original version of the art with more information.3.\tAllow sufficient timeGive yourself time to appreciate the location, the buildings and also the views at the city below.4.\tPickpocketsCareful at the bottom of the Acropolis near the ticket booth yep! It happened to me – group of young girls.5.\tClimbI’m not so in shape and the climb was easy, so do it, try. On your way up, go at your rhythm and stop.  Sometimes, you can be surprise of things you can see when you sit down and look around. Wear good shoes- avoid flip flop and high heels.Enjoy the most see attraction in Athens.\n",

The climb was steep, but just take your time. Make sure you have good shoes with traction. The marble can be slippery.  Wet or dry.  I used a guide for this one.   Just too much history to miss. “Athens Walking Tours” is excellent.  They have a large variety of tours and are inexpensive.  I took the “5-hour” tour for 99 Euro.  30 of that covered the tickets.  It covered parts of Athens (Plaka), Changing of the Guard for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Parliament, National Garden, Acropolis, the Museum, and other sites. Worth every penny.  Just check their website carefully to make the right selection for you. Make sure you visit the Acropolis Museum afterwards so you can truly understand the splendor of the ancient Acropolis. This incredibly spacious, modern, and comfortable museum houses wonderful artifacts and also explains the reconstruction efforts.\n",

Having just visited the museum with Nadia, she was able to bring the ruins to life for us so that we really understood the significance of what we were seeing and visualise how these monuments would have been many centuries before.  So much better than just wandering around without really having much idea about it all, as many other people seemed to be doing!  A word of caution, you really do need to wear sensible shoes up there as the surface is very uneven and slippery in places (even when the weather is dry as it usually is).

You can buy tickets at any of the 5 or so sites. $30 for a ticket to all sites and good for a week.     There are water vending machines inside by the south gate nearest the acropolis subway station. 50 cents and bring coins as they often eat cash.     September/October are good weather months to visit.      Very busy from around 10am to 2pm as the cruise ship tours are there then.      Wear hiking shoes leave your flip flops at home.         Sunscreen and carry water with you.          The climb is steep and rough but they have concreted allot this year so it is much smoother but most of it is very rough. If you are not in good shape you will have a tough time. The flights home are full of people who found out the hard way.

In any case, this is a place worth visiting as pictures and videos just don’t do it justice. Take your time and walk around the Erechtheion several times and each time you will see more detail. Be prepared for the long walk up the steep path to the Propylaea (and don’t slip on the exposed marble). Take your time and rest along the way if you need to; there’s plenty to see.

On the topic of the Acropolis though it is a must visit. A short walk up to the top of the hill will show you many sights including the Theater of Dionysus. Once at the top there are many other sights apart from the Acropolis such as the Temple of Athena Nike. It also provides beautiful views of the city and the countryside around it.I would recommend getting here early however or booking your tickets online via the official site to save both time and money as queues can easily take up to an hour. Another way to save time is to visit one of the less popular sights on the pass, buy the pass there for the same price then skip the queues later when you get to the Acropolis.\n",

It is truly beautiful and the whole experience is incredible.Following advice on here (thank you all) I aimed to get there at 8am opening.  Due to delays on transport I ended up getting there about 8.30.  Accessed it by tourist information and Acropolis station.This is by all accounts the easier access point but beware...its still hard going.  Fairly steep in places with slippy rocks.Having read this before I went (thanks again every one on TA!) I brought some Karrimor ultra dyna grip walking trainers.  I am clumsy and honestly dont think I would have made it without them....I did see a few women in high heels and plenty of people in flip flops so depends on the person I guess.  I also saw 3 people fall over...Once you are at the top of the hill almost entering the Acropolis...there are some high steps.  This is quite common in Athens area...I struggle with those massive steps with no barriers (scared of heights!), but a kind lady helped me up.  There is a staircase on the left of this which you can access too though...so that's helpful...would rather climb the normal stairs with the handrail than the huge ones!Once up there you can spend as long as you like there which I think is awesome.  Really enjoyed walking around at my own pace and experiencing it.  The tour groups started to arrive around 9am which is around the time I made it to the top but just went the opposite way round to them so wasn't too crowded.I left around 11.30 and they were allowing access only in one entrance and exit only the other...I had to leave via the steps and it was access only through the slopes (by the theatre) This was fine and you come out just by Aeropagus Rock and can hear the singing from pilgrimages and there are lots of craft stalls which is fun.Overall I loved it but in general have found here very little health and safety and zero signage...so just take that into account and you will be fineEnjoy the experience it's truly spectacular.Also one more word of warning - if anyone tries to give you a bracelet they take your hand and tie it on...using 4 or 5 knots saying it's free then demand money.  They are very aggressive.  Polite Nos do not work I shouted at the top of my voice \"Please leave me alone \" &, that worked but I have watched so many people be roped in whilst sitting nearby people watching.There are also rose people who do the same with Rose's and beggar ladies with children...do not make eye contact...say No firmly and they do leave you alone.\n",

Once you get through the bottleneck at the west gate, the entire Acropolis opens up and there is plenty of space to explore all it has to offer. We entered around 10 am on a Sunday and while it took about 10 minutes to get into the west gate once we got there, we didn’t find the crowds overwhelming.\n",

Bring lots of water and wear light athletic shoes that have some grip as many walking stones are slippery (like marble). I wore running sneakers and found that they were too hot. They have a couple of water bubblers near the top so you can refill your water bottle so you don't have to carry a mammoth bottle from the start.

He also has podcasts for the Agora and the archeological museum and a city walk one. The Agora one was good too but I haven't listened to the others yet. As for the parthenon, 20 euros is a fairly pricey... but you're only visiting Athens once aren't you? And the parthenon really is a magnificent ancient sight. Amazing views and late afternoon offers incredible photo lighting.

We descended down the path to the main entrance, and up or down is fine, but is more challenging, because of the gravel & dirt slopes. All that out of the way; it’s awe inspiring to visit!\n",

I sort of think that when people talk about the difficulty it is in reference to how you decide to approach the entrances.  Later on that week we climbed Mars Hill and it was a lot more of an upward walk on the roads etc. to get to it.The rocks are slippery but if you pay attention and walk on the area between them you have no problem at all.Be smart in the shoes you wear and bring a bottle of water.Was not overly crowed when we were up there and it is a beautiful as every photo you have seen shows it to be.

Once up the top the crowd dissipates more and you can find your own space.  It really is an amazing view and well worth the effort.  Be prepared for scaffolding around the monument.

There was significant confusion as people tried to enter, thinking that tickets could be purchased at gate, so this caused more unhappy patrons as they had queued for almost an hour to find out that they had to get in ANOTHER queue nearby to get tickets! Fortunately the guides at entry gate allowed those who did so to return with their tickets to the head of queue. Some pathways are uneven and treacheros as marble is very slippery. There are guides everywhere supervising as some stupid people try to climb the monuments,  a sharp whistle and shouting soon sorts that out. I recommend that you purchase tickets for all monuments as some are not on the Acropolis but well worth viewing even as they are scattered within the city and it is cheaper than purchasing individual tickets. Keep your ticket as it must be shown at each site. This is a real wonder of the Ancient world, a definite bucket list item. It is very crowded and hot and not really suitable for wheelchairs or those with mobility difficulties. There is security checks of backpacks on entry and only water bottles no other drinks allowed. No toilet facilites or refreshment available but there is that not far from entry. Allow at least 1-2hours to explore Acropolis alone.\n",

We missed the raising of the flag by an inch but saw the military parade going down which was great as well.However we were disappointed by the rudeness of the staff at the entrance as well as the lack of info for what is the biggest must do in Athens. At the ticket office we showed our student ID's for free entrance as stated on the website to be promptly told that my international student card (ISIC) was not accepted... In other places staff accepted it or were very apologetic and agreed to let me in if I could show some other proof like a document from my school. Had to pay the normal entrance fee of € 20 instead as this ISIC is the only proof we get in our college and was treated very rude.The lack of info signs and lack of audioguide for what is Athens biggest attraction just made the impression that this is a milk cow for the Greek state more obvious. Luckily we downloaded the free Rick Steves audioguide beforehand on our smartphones which gave us the info we needed. Still I'd rather have some good info for the price they ask...Tip: Go at 8am when the acropolis opens and take the 2nd entrance (close to the acropoli metro stop on the right after following the first signs for the acropolis). There are almost no lines there and going early will give you a glimpse of the ceremony the army does every morning. After that the acropolis gets very crowded\n",

The woman there was the rudest person I have ever heard.She was selling frozen drinks but had no bottled water. The rudeness was beyond comprehension.

I was warned about the crowds and so went at 09:00 in the morning.  Even then there were quite a few people, but it wasn't overcrowded.  It's a steep walk up, so wear trainers or sensible shoes.  Loose fitting sandals may give problems.  There's no refreshment along the route or on the Acropolis itself, so take a bottle of water.  You will need it.  Information for each of the ruins is present, but there's little of it.  I advise reading up on the history of ancient Athens and of the Acropolis before you go so that you're not just looking at some ruins without knowing their significance.\n",

There was nothing to read, to help facilitate learning or any other redeeming factor here. Apart from the significance of the building itself, our enjoyment was completely quashed by the fact it is clearly managed terribly and not at all cared for by the management. We had to drink tepid (probably unhygienic) water from the toilet taps as it was so hot and there was nowhere to get water or shelter. This was basically apparent at most of the sites in Athens so 'absolute dump' was the phrase of the week to be honest.\n",

You can simply buy the tickets online for the same price, search for the \"ETickets\" Greece site, pick the 'EN' option and go through the various forms. You will eventually receive an email with a QR code. On the day, go to the Acropolis gates and just use your phone to scan your code and the turnstile lets you through.If you are afraid of the internet, there are also Acropolis Ticket Machines where you can use your credit card and buy the tickets. It's faster, more convenient and the lines are shorter. The ticket machines are near both gates, they are right by the ATMs.  Which gate to use - There are two gates. There's the main Acropolis gate which everyone goes to. But there's also a gate at the Theater of Dionysus side. It's on the eastern side and you can get to it pretty quickly, it's right across from Makrigianni street.When to go - the Acropolis now suffers from overtourism, if you have had this place on a bucket list your experience may be spoiled by the constant streams of tour groups, the 4.1 instagrammers per squared meter and the oppressive heat and dust. For this reason you may want to go as early as possible, hoping that nobody else has the same idea (spoiler: many others have the same idea as you). The first available slot is the 8 AM, so go to the gates, with your prepurchased tickets and queue there right at 745 AM. However note that even at this time there will be plenty of people.\n",

Because of our travel, we got to the Acropolis in the middle of the afternoon, which wasn't wise.  We waited in line for tickets for about 25 minutes--not much shade.  Tickets were 20 euros a piece. Once we had our tickets in hand, we walked up the steps and did the self-guided tour.  The walking was hardly straightforward--the ground was uneven and very slippery because the surface has been worn over time. I'd hate to see the place in the rain as the footing would be treacherous.  We took many great pictures and the view was commanding over the city.  There is a restroom and drinking fountain once you're inside the structure and there's a major effort underway to rescue and preserve the buildings.  All in all, we're glad we went and the only sour experience was the cab drivers that line up to take you back to your hotel from the Acropolis will take advantage of you--it cost us 15 euros to return to the Hilton.

It’s simple; 20 euros gets you into the Acropolis and 30 euros gets you into the Acropolis plus several other great sites including the temple of Olympian Zeus, the Ancient Agora, Hadrians library, The Roman Agora etc.  The trick is to buy your combo ticket at one of the lesser sites where there are few if any queues.Then there’s the issue of time.  Getting there early is obviously a good idea but alternatively we found it relatively quiet going in at around 2 p.m. when many are still at lunch.The site itself is fantastic, not only is there the Parthenon but several smaller temples and a great amphitheater.  Basically it lives up to expectations.Expect a lot of walking, some on rough ground and lots of people. Take water as there is none on site.  I would say you will spend 2-3 hours depending on your levels of energy and interest.\n",

The Parthenon is undergoing restoration for decades now, so it has some new parts and some parts are under scaffolding. Nevertheless it is beautiful to see and very impressive! The entrance is grand and there are two other temples to see. And of course; an great view of all of Athens. Unlike the signs you can’t go directly from the Anafiotika village (the cute small Amafli looking houses) to the Acropolis. Go back to the road and follow the signs or maps to the entrance.Price and ticketsA ticket is quite expensive; 20 euros. But hopefully a lot of it is going to the restoration. And for 30 euros you can buy a package ticket where you can also visit the Agora site (and museum), the roman agora, the library and a few other sites. Unlike what you expect, it doesn’t provide access to the Acropolis museum. If you just want to see the Agora site and Acropolis don’t buy the package deal since Agora ticket is € 8,-. And the Agora site is really intriguing, since this was the economic, democratic and social heart beat of Athens. The Roman is agora is small and less interesting. The most of the library you see from the outside. TipsBack to Acropolis, it’s quite a climb and a lot of the plain isn’t paved so sturdy shoes with a good profile helps prevent slipping on the slippery marble. Most of it isn’t shaded so don’t go in the middle of the day and wear plenty of UV protection (sunscreen, hats, rash guard or even an umbrella). We used the free audio tour of the app Rick Steves audio tours. Works well! He has devised a route and along the way tells interesting things about the Acropolis and it’s buildings. In the app there is also a map. And there are some other free tours available.\n",

A visit when the works are complete would be much better. We bought the 5 day €30 ticket but were disappointed to discover you can only visit the Acropolis once in those five days. Would have been nice to return to watch the sun set and see the different colours in the marble with the dusk. Oh and wear sensible footwear as the marble is like ice and is super slippery! We’ve seen a lot of tourists with broken arms and legs and wouldn’t be surprised if they have all fallen over on the slippery marble. Just warning you all!\n",

In Roman times it also served for gladiator fights, which were banned later with adopting Christianity.After the Romans the stadium experienced a decay phase, when it's terrific white marble was used for house building around.The revival phase started with Pierre de Coubertain who initiated the first modern Olympics to be held on this stadium in 1896. For this occasion the stadium was renovated with the same white marble we see today.The entry fee is only 5 Euros and is well worth it, including an audio guide.Be sure to climb the stands for great views of Athens and Acropolis.On the far left end is a tunnel leading to a small but nice museum with Olympic torches and memorabilia.\n",

      "Review text is :The Panathinaiko or Panathenaic Stadium is a must-see when visiting Athens. This was the site of the precursor of the modern Olympics, the Panathenaic Games that took place every 4 years from the 4th Century BCE to the 6th Century AD.  We had first spotted the stadium from the east end of the Acropolis, nestled in a ravine between two wooded hills, Agra and Ardettos, and it was a fairly easy stroll from our hotel.This is the world’s only stadium made entirely of marble, but the current structure does not date that far back. The narrow valley been the site of a race course since the 6th Century BCE, even prior to the Panathenaic Games, and initially spectators just watched from the hillside. 200 years later, during the 4th Century BCE, formal seating was built. In the 2nd Century AD Herodotus Atticus - the builder of the Odeon theatre at the Acropolis - constructed the precursor to this particular stadium completely out of white marble. Using the same white Pentelic marble of which the Parthenon was built the new stadium seated 50,000. Gladiator fights were apparently held here in addition to athletic competitions.  After the collapse of the Roman Empire the stadium fell into ruin, was grown over, and even became a field of wheat. Stadium marble was repurposed for local construction, similar to what happened to the marble of the Colosseum in Rome.In the late 19th Century the stadium was rebuilt for the start of modern Olympic Games, the first of which was held in 1896 here in Athens. Once again using white Pentelic marble the stadium was expanded to seat 80,000. Two special seats were created for the King George I and Queen Olga of Greece; you can find these seats at the lowest level on the right side when facing the curved end of the stadium.It is a U-shaped stadium, not a complete oval. At 200 meters in length it is not of regulation proportions for current athletic games. It was rehabbed for the 2004 Olympic Games and hosted the archery events and was the finishing line for the marathon. It continues to be the finish line for the Athens marathon.Be sure to check out the small museum displaying the posters of all the modern Olympics as well as the official torches used to carry the Olympic flame. The Olympic flame is lit at the Temple of Hera in Olympia and a relay carries it around Greece. The final stop in Greece is the Panathenaic Stadium where the flame is transferred to the runners of that year’s host city.The track features a comfortable black rubber surface. The rubber track may have been 21st Century in origin but the stadium features a drainage design from 19th Century, a critical design feature as the stadium would have to handle the drainage of rainfall pouring off the 2 hills into the valley. In addition to a drain surrounding the athletic field the drainage was facilitated by having the track raised 30 cm above the surrounding ground level.From the U-end of the stadium we had a good view of the Acropolis and the Parthenon.\n",

One of the main historic attractions of Athens, it is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble.A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by the Athenian statesman Lykourgos (Lycurgus) c. 330 BC, primarily for the Panathenaic Games. It was rebuilt in marble by Herodes Atticus, an Athenian Roman senator, by 144 AD and had a capacity of 50,000 seats. After the rise of Christianity in the 4th century it was largely abandoned. The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870 and 1875. After being refurbished, it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 contested sports. It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004. It is the finishing point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon. It is also the last venue in Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to the host nation takes place.\n",

Also, contrary to the previous reviewer, the entrance fee is in fact EUR 5 and not EUR 10, so well worth the experience, especially if you're an Olympic/running/history fan. It's an amazing experience and there are loads of tiny details all around that you would never even see if you didn't go in and see the place up close (eg. the cool tunnel through which the athletes emerged, the unexpected view from the Parthenon from the rafters of the stadium, the two seats for the rulers right at the far end of the track, etc. There are too many details to list).More so than the Acropolis/Parthenon/Temple of Zeus, etc. this place in the early morning light was the favourite spot for our group of four.

There's also a bit of fun in walking the track in the centre. There is a free and useful audio guide that runs about 35-40 minutes, though my machine kept automatically shutting off. Worth noting that there are steep steps and no railings, of course, so not suitable for those with mobility issues.The 'museum' is mostly historical Olympic posters, and the upper floor was locked the day I was there.

While it was used back in 330BC it has been improved over time to welcome the 1896 first modern Olympic Games.The less than 60,000 spectator marble horseshoe shape stadium is solid.  We understood that the decision of hosting the first Olympic games did come with an important challenge, funding.  The city was, at the time, under financial difficulties and the construction of the stadium is undeniably associated with the financial contribution of prosperous entrepreneurs like George Averoff who made it possible and who’s statue is on the front of the site.From there you can easily have access to the Zappeion,- National Garden, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Hadrian’s Arch and the National Garden.\n",

I'm somewhat of an avid fitness enthusiast (my friend too) and we decided to get up early one morning to get a little run in on our vacation to Athens a few weeks back. We arrived around 8:30 am and with a small entry fee (I think it was 5 or 6 euros) we were able to spend a considerable amount of time there. The place was practically empty and it was fantastic having it all to ourselves. We ran several laps and ran up and down the stadium steps (which were insanely steep at points and so much fun), ran down through the tunnel where past olympic athletes entered the stadium (pretending to be one ourselves!), and had a blast. The views from the top were gorgeous.  We stayed for quite a while and did the audio walking tour which was great to hear a full history on the stadium as well. Highly recommend. You can feel the weight of history there.  So worth the trip and it was one of our Athens highlights!\n",

Unfortunately, free tickets do not include the audio tour.The stadium has ramp access to around the track and the track itself but unfortunately there is no way to get to any of the seating (which is good for photos).There is a small museum space in a tunnel - the tunnel is a very steep hill. At the top of the tunnel is some signage and pictures about Greek history and there is then a set of stairs to the main museum with the Olympic torches (there is no step-free access to here and I was unable to see it).Overall the attraction was nice to visit, and I wouldn't say it is inaccessible enough that disabled travellers should skip it, but it was disappointing given it is advertised to be accessible online that key parts of the museum space were not. Otherwise it was a very nice view and good for photos - given the cheap price I think it is well worth a visit.\n",

BUT there is so much more: a whole museum dedicated to the Olympics, flags of various nations hosting the games, artifacts of some of the most momentous happening, both thrilling and sorrowful.

It was refurbished in 1870 and since then has hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the modern Olympics with the relay of the Olympic torch.  It is also the finishing point of the Athens Classic Marathon.There are several \"sweet\" spots in the stadium with the most important one being front and center.  From this spot the acoustics are outstanding, permitting singers to perform without microphones.  Excited to try this out I was disappointed to be told that by order of the governor or Athens, no singing is permitted!  Apparently some overly exuberant American students performed a rather bawdy song, recorded it and uploaded it to YouTube.  Thanks, guys.\n",

One of the main historic attractions of Athens,it is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble.A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by the Athenian statesman Lykourgos  for the Panathenaic Games. It was rebuilt in marble by Herodes Atticus, an Athenian Roman senator had a capacity of 50,000 seats. After the rise of Christianity in the 4th century it was largely abandoned. The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870 and 1875. After being refurbished, it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 contested sports. It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004. It is the finishing point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon. It is also the last venue in Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to the host nation takes place.We enjoyed very much our tour in Kalimarmaro. We higly recommend it.\n",

Best way to get there is with the red open top City Sightseeing bus - it stops right outside and has an excellent commentary of the stadium in 12 languages as one approaches. It gives one an essential background of what one is about to find before them because this is no ordinary stadium. This stadium is unique for two reasons; it is built entirely of marble for the First Modern Olympics in Athens in 1898 and follows exactly the design of the original Olympic stadium that stood here on the precise spot in the 6th Century bC. The configuration of the running track is astonishing too. It is still used today for concerts and athletic events and is where the Marathon finished in the 2004 Olympic Games of Athens. There is a 5 euro fee to get in, discounted if one has a red bus ticket, and the walk around the arena is quite delightful. We took some wonderful Instagram pics there. Not to be missed.\n",

I decided that I only had a few more hours in Athens before my flight and after taking the short walk from my hotel to the stadium, I may as well go.There is a free audio tour that is actually quite good.  It goes through the history of the stadium, which is very, very old, and its refurbishment for the first modern Olympic games.  It also talks about some of the caves underneath and some of the pagan rituals that were associated with them, as well as their usage as changing rooms during the more modern Olympics.  The tour also highlighted the fact that, uniquely, this is the only fully marble stadium in the world.  If only for that, it is an impressive feat, and it certainly is worth seeing.  Seeing something so large made out of marble really does make it compare favorably with even some of the more modern Olympic stadiums, such as those in Beijing.And if you enjoy taking photos, there are some beautiful views of Mount Lycabettus and the Acropolis from the higher seats that are worth taking.  This made for some of the best pictures that I took during my trip to Athens.Overall, this is a place that I just arbitrarily picked, but it was actually one of the highlights of my trip to Athens.  Highly recommended.\n",

It’s a small museum but it does have some interesting Olympic items.  There is also a small gift shop in the museum.The stadium is also the location of the finish line for the annual Athens Marathon.  You have to be careful when climbing up into the stands since there are no guard rails.  There isn’t much shade in the stadium or stands so a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are recommended.\n",

It was very upsetting to me to see this behavior. I am Greek and I’m embarrassed to see a Greek person who is security for a big tourist attraction to treat an animal like that. It made me very sad and really ruined the rest of my day. When I went to ask him what he did with her he just kept saying he called animal control and that she was in the park.

A wreath of the holy olive tree of Zeus and demolishing one the city-state of the winner demolishes a part of the city walls; to bear the winner's name; as protector of his city. How much our world needs us now to propagate for these sublime and noble notions; peace, coexistence, cosmopolitan, sportif ethics, patriotisme and appreciation of humanity away from the materialistic and formal trends. Stadium is a word of pure Greek stem. The stadium is downtown the city of  of Athens and it's an architectural masterpiece. It is very close to Syntagma square, Plaka, the National Gardens, Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Arch of Hadrian. You can also see the Acropolis from there. There are amazing statues erected in front of the Stadium one of them is of the famous disc thrower. The place is suitable for groups and families with children.

      "Review text is :Built in limestone in 330BC on the site of a 6th century BC racecourse, this stadium is now the only one in the world built entirely of marble after being re-constructed by Herodes Atticus in c. 138AD. It was used to host the Panathenaic Games which were both a religious & athletic festival to honour the Goddess Athena.The stadium measures approximately 260m long with tiers of seating arranged around the track. The track itself measures 204m long by 34m wide. Bloody displays & spectacles were banned in the 4th century AD so the stadium became unused & fell into disrepair.In 1836 an excavation uncovered some traces of the stadium & a major refurbishment went ahead in the late 19th century ahead of the 1896 Olympic Games. At these Games the opening & closing ceremonies took place in the stadium as well as various Athletics, Gymnastic, Weightlifting & Wrestling events. The stadium has more recently been used to host the Archery events plus the finish of both the men's & women's Marathons at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium has featured in pictorial form on all the Summer Olympic medals awarded in 2004. 2008, 2012 & 2016. It really is worth visiting this stunning & historic site.\n",

The audio guide takes you through the history and each part of the stadium. You can also walk onto the centre stage and go for a 400m track jog which many people did. My friend and I decided to sprint 100m against each other but he ended up pulling both hamstrings! I still loved the experience of being in this stadium, and thoroughly recommending coming here.

It comes with a free audio tour that you collect as you enter the stadium - I highly recommend you use that as you make your way around the grounds. The steps to get to the higher level of the stands are very steep and uneven thanks to decades of exposure - so for those of us with short legs or daunted by the number of steps it might seem worth skipping. My recommendation, climb up at the middle of the horseshoe - it's a great view and worth making that climb. Just ask a friend or fellow tourist for a hand when you get to the steep steps that you need to cross to the access the upper level. If you're hoping to fit in other sites, you might consider skipping the Poster & Torch display inside. Don't! It's a pretty cool walk through the cave, and if nothing else it's an excellent break from the scorching heat (if you're there in the summer like we were)!

We couldn't purchase the Olympic poster that we wanted to and I think it is unacceptable that your store isn't open yet the site is. The hours of the store were advertised as the same times as the site. We noticed the staff that work here are unhelpful and not really doing much...But I'd recommend this site!\n",

Having paid the entrance fee we were allowed to climb the steps to get a view down onto the track from the top and some typically touristy style photos. After walking around the top of the seating and back down the steep marble staircase we embarked on the cool walk in the tunnel that would have graced thousands of athletes over the years and into the museum. There is plenty of things to learn and Olympic torches to see.After a visit to the museum we walked the track that was last used in the 2004 Olympics before getting a photo on the podium.Unfortunately the entrance is not included in the Acropolis Combi ticket but it is certainly worth paying the extra €5 euros if you are a sports fan.If you are not wanting to pay to enter but want a view over the stadium there is a neighbourhood and hill that resides to the back of the stadium wherein you can get a fantastic view.\n",

Taking pictures, running around the track pretending to be a winner, standing on the first, second or third place podium gives you a simple sense of what it would have been like with fans cheering, crying and screaming your name.  One place many people miss, is to go through the tunnel on the far left corner from the street entrance. Make sure to walk this tunnel, this is where the Athletes came through after waiting in the rooms at the end, to come out and perform.  Those rooms on two levels have been turned into a favorite small museum representing the glory of the games that were created by the Greeks so many many years ago when first started in Olympia.  Don't miss this site during your visit, you will throughly enjoy the feeling of what it is all about.\n",

There is a plaza between the stadium and the street, so you can see the stadium and appreciate the size and construction, but it is fun to pay the 5 euro admission charge and go for a run around the track (or pick up an audio guide for the facts and figures). There is also a small museum through one of the tunnels, it’s mostly just posters from the history of the modern Olympics, with an interactive terminal that offers more facts and figures. By the way, the word stadium comes from the length of the track, one stade, a measure of length in ancient times, equal to about 185 metres.\n",

After being abandoned and later excavated in the 1800s, it hosted the first modern games in 1896. It was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004.

Very good audio guide (12 or so stops around the stadium). An historic site but would also make a great venue for sporting events or concerts today, Would benefit from an on-site cafe.\n",

Acropolis just as good view so if going there don’t bother with this.However if a hike up and then a meal or ice cream at one of the cafes at the top appeals to you then probably worth it.

      "Review text is :(I'm writing this not just for the experience but because Tripadvisor should be ashamed to have a random almost-10-yo negative experience with rather selfish advice as the first review for others to read.) Just got back from a family visit to Athens, rode the teleferik up Mt. Lycabettus which we had never heard of..and it was awesome! No, they don't make it abundantly clear that you DO NOT require a return trolly ride back down (you can buy a one way up as it's a nice long walk back down the mountain) but that's a very welcome option for mama or pop-pop or anyone who simply can't be on their feet for too long (you're going to walk alot visiting the abundance of Greece's ancient sites.) It's ridiculous to complain about there being nothing to see while the teleferik car ascends the interior of a mountain...IT'S THE INTERIOR OF A MOUNTAIN and therefore no windows, no sightseeing or entertainment. Which would be a waste if not an ingeneering imposibility; the view once at the top is the best in all of Athens. You are at a significantly higher elevation than the Acropolis and if you go later in the day as we did, you get incredibly beautiful views of a lit-up Parthenon and what seems like the entirety of Athens herself. In April 2022 the ride is 7 Euros, so about $7.50..SO worth it. There's a restaurant with equally great views of Athens also near the top, and at the very top is the small church of St. George which you can pick out against the Greek sky from virtually any other site you visit. We crammed ALOT of visits into our 7 days - if you only had one day in Athens, Mt. Lycabettus should figure somewhere near the \"top\" of your list (see what I did there?)\n",

What some might not know tough, is that if you climb the lycabettos mountain, you'll have some great views over the acropolis, the city and its ancient ruins and even up to the see. The climb seems rough, and the mountain seems far a way from the city centre, but I'd say it is very doable. I think it is only a 15 minute walk from the city centre to the foot of the mountain. You'll come across some great neighbourhoods, with hips cafes and fancy stores, along the way. The climb to the top of the hill is doable but it is quite steep. No need to bring walking shoes or anything, but keep that in mind. Before reaching the top after about a 30/30 minute climb, you'll find several little seating areas along the way. At the top there is a lovely little church and two cafes. It is nice to walk up one way, and take another route down. Would highly recommend taking this hike.

There are several benches and overlooks to stop and take a break.  There are numerous trails throughout the area and we sometimes took shortcuts on a trail and hooked back up with the road a little farther up the hill.  About two thirds of the way up, you take a paved trail with a lot of stairs to the top.  Many cars were dropping people off at this spot.  At the top there is a small viewing area, a bar, restaurant, and the Chapel of St. George.  The views are spectacular and well worth the hike.  I got some great pictures of the Acropolis and Parthenon from the viewing area.  When you look at the mountain from below, you would think it would be a difficult climb, but don’t let that scare you from making the climb.  If you really don’t feel you can make the entire climb from the bottom, get a taxi to take you up to the drop off point, or alternatively take the funicular.

There we were approached by taxi drivers who said that they would take us to top fo 8 euros as the funicular would have been double that we took advantage. The drive took us around the other side of the hill and we were dropped at some steps which was quite a climb. On deciding to walk down we discovered we had hardly saved any walking distance by taking taxi so if you are relatively active it is quite easy to do complete climb - we are pensioners. Well worth the effort as the 360 degree panoramic view it incredible. Well designed cafe set into the top along with a small Orthodox Church. Of course we did it in February, the hot sun of summer may make it a difficult journey as there is no shade\n",

We cabbed to the tram and hire a local car/taxi ( very nice mercedes) for half a day.  Round trip tram for two would be 30 euros and we agreed to 50 euros  for the car/driver.  We drove to scenic areas for pictures, declined to walk the steps to the monastery but could have, and let the mountain for other sight seeing.

Most of the mountain is a charming and somewhat upscale neighborhood with steep, winding streets and staircases overflowing with vegitation and trees. Great to stroll on a hot day as it's shady,but the climb could be tiring. Near the top there's a cable car which takes you to the peak and there you can enjoy an unmatched 360 view of Athens and a great view of the Acropolis. The cable car has very limited operation hours, mainly till noon and also runs every 30 min, so keep in mind to check the time table and opening hours, so you won't be stuck waiting to go up. There's also a restaurant on top of the hill, but i wouldn't recommend eating there as it's mainly a tourist trap.\n",

My cousin was actually standing far in the back away from the crowd when she was pickpocketed and she was there for less than 5 minutes. They even have signs to warn you about the pickpockets but everything happened so quick. Honestly, viewing the acropolis from the hill wasn’t worth it as it’s too far away to see and unless you have an excellent professional camera, you cannot capture the acropolis clearly. It was also inconvenient  trying to call the banks to cancel the cards, but good thing we did it early as the thief tried to withdraw over $700 at an atm.\n",

Once we reached the top, we walked through the restaurant (we didn't eat there...it looked like a tourist trap) and up to the top of Mount Lycabettus. The lookout area was very small and crowded, and it felt like a competition to get a view of the panorama. The church of St. George was cute. Honestly, I felt like we wasted the good part of the day to reach the top of Mount Lycabettus, and it was a real letdown.

There was a short way for the funicular to go up and back down and we had to stand both ways. The funicular was also inside a tunnel, with no view. Once we reached the viewing terrace, it was very crowded, especially on the side facing the Acropolis. It was very cool and windy. The Acropolis is so far away, it's not a very spectacular view. But, the worst part was the haze, which caused everything to look gray and fuzzy. The most interesting aspect of being there at that time of day was when the city lights began to come on as the sun was setting.\n",

I also enjoyed looking back towards the sea and the Acropolis.  There is a small chapel up there and a couple of restaurants, which I hope to get to go to next time!  It was such a nice day, I decided to walk back to the Plaka area by taking the trail off the SW side.  Both the visit and the walk down were well worth the time.\n",

To reach the top one may walk (could be a bit exhausting if the weather is warm) or take the funicular for 7,5€ round trip price. The wind can be rather strong on the top of the mountain, take care of your hats! There is a restaurant (only one) there for those who want to dine with a view, but the menu was short and prices, understandably, a bit high, so we decided to go for a less windy place. But the mountain must be recommended for the views: a walk from Syntagma, Funicular ride, time enjoying the view for a while and walk back took us about 2,5 hours.\n",

We wanted to see the sunset from there and it was very spectacular. There is a restaurant and a few cafees up there, but we instead chose to eat at the foot of the hill, in the Kolonaki area. We then walked up (about 25 minutes with breaks) and arrived at the top in good time for the sunset. There are seatings along the rail at the top, so we could sit and enjoy the view. It got crowded around 8 pm, an hour before sunset (9 pm in July). It was hot up there so bring water, but there was a person who sold 500 mL water bottles for 1 euro.Would definitely recommend going, especially in the evening so you can enjoy the sunset.\n",

There are two ways to reach the top - either by walking up or with a cable car that costs €7 for a round trip. My husband and I were very excited about taking the cable car as we thought that we would get a beautiful view of Athens. However, the cable car is a 3-minute journey that takes you from the bottom to the top inside a capsule (tunnel). There are no views to be observed, and I would assume that the walk up the hill, though more exhausting, would yield better views. The restaurant on top serves delicious food but is pricey.\n",

You can see the main spots, Parthenon on top of Acropolis, Piraeus, Olympiakos Stadium, to the south, Parnitha to the west, Kifissia, Maroussi and Mount Penteli to the north and Ymittos to the east. There are a few vantage points here and if the weather is clear then you will enjoy being on top of the world almost.It is surprising to see how much higher you are in relation to the Parthenon, whilst on Acropolis hill you dont feel it is so much higher.

The cable car is relatively cheap, I dont remember the exact price, but was under 10 Euro, and takes you straight to the top on a VERY steep transfer. Once at the top there is a restaurant and bar, with a surprising amount of room for tables to sit at. We didnt eat here, so I cant comment on the food, but we did sit and have a drink and the views even from there are spectacular. A few dozen steps above the restaurant is the summit of the mountain where the views are incredible of the entire city. We went on a fairly cloudy day in June but could still see for miles. Whilst at the top of the mountain a thunderstorm rolled towards us, and you could literally see the blanket of rain moving closer and closer to the mountain which was really cool to see, and then sitting in the restaurant having a drink whilst the thunder and lightning was going off (some of the lightning hitting VERY close to where we were) was an incredible experience as well. There is also a little chapel at the top of Saint George, and although it is nice, theres not a whole lot to see in there.If you're looking for a great view of the city then this is a must, be other than that there isnt a whole lot to do up there.\n",

Eventually a man appeared out of what looked like a cupboard and took them to scan. When you're at the top, the views are honestly amazing.

      "Review text is :I went to this at around 9 am on a weekday in October, I'm not sure of the exact date. But go early as it is a popular viewing area and can get crowded with locals and tourists, this is when it pays to have a selfi-stick or a tripod (for the serious photographer). There are 2 ways to get to the view: 1) take a vehicle (rental, taxi, bus) or the method that I prefer 2) walk/slight hike to the viewing point at the top. Once at the top you can enjoy a mostly 360 view, I say mostly because there is an old church that is pretty much in the middle of the viewing area, which then you'd have to walk to the other side to enjoy the view, but good news there are restrooms at the top on the left side (I believe) of the church. There is also an older gentleman that sells cold drinks and snacks (a little overpriced) to make some extra cash. There is also a nice restaurant that is on a lower level of the viewing area, I didn't go in because I had already eaten breakfast but it looked pretty expensive which usually means that it was overpriced for tourists, none the less it was an overall great experience that takes up about  1-3 hours of your day depending on your method of transportation to, up and down the \"mount\"; more like a really big hill.

Your hearth will be touched by the amazing panorama about the city of Athens and will be so nice to recognize historical places from there. Now, practical advise: take a taxi from whenever you are and ask the driver to drive you to funicular on Lycabettus. The streets are so narrow and there are missing parking places so, the best is you not to care about this. From there you can go up via stairs (15 min to the top) or via funicular. Just be there!\n",

The smell of pine trees and  blossomed oranges followed us all the way down.It was an amazing journey and I am very glad we did it.If you decide to go by walking keep in mind you should be with a comfortable shoes, have a hat and a bottle of water.

The views are spectacular and you really can see for miles. Although in the distance, you are actually standing above the Acropolis in terms of height and perspective so good for photos! There is a well equipped cafe at the top which does have toilets even though they take some finding. There is also a tiny church which although worth a look, was sadly a bit of a tourist thoroughfare when we visited. We did walk back down and although a nice walk it is still quite demanding. I believe in honest reviews so I wouldn’t say it was a gentle stroll down. The path is steep and at times uneven. There are also sections of gravel and elongated steps so although it’s not arduous it isn’t for someone with a knee or leg injury or a pushchair etc. You could however walk around the road that comes down the mountain which is less tricky but it is still quite steep. You then have the steep decent down into Athens proper. Don’t let that put you off as it’s a great view point.\n",

There is a little souvenir shop at the terminal where I bought a little bronze owl, a bit like the ones at the Acropolis museum. The ride up in the funicular is only a few minutes and it’s hidden away underground so that you get out at the top faced with a great view. It worth it for the view and there is a cafe there if you need it. The view is spectacular in every direction and it’s quite plain to see why Athens is called the Edinburgh of the south with all its hills! It’s a nice walk down again passed old and gnarled pine trees and we ended up in a market in what is otherwise an ordinary part of the city.\n",

We paused numerous times to admire the beautiful city, sea and landscape, and took plenty of pictures. Unless you struggle to walk, skip the funicular and walk. Take your time, soak it all in and enjoy. Who expects to see the sea in one moment, and then snow capped mountains the next? We certainly did not. Loved this and highly recommend taking the time just for you and your soul.\n",

For the photographers that read this, ideally you would shoot the Acropolis with a telephoto zoom lens at  135-200mm focal length (35 mm equivalent) and a tripod after sunset is necessary.  The nice thing is that there is a cheap cable car that takes you to the top so you don’t have to lug your equipment.

Once you’re up there, it’s breathtaking. You can see the entire city of Athens. We went around 2 PM so we had enough time to take photos, take in the views and then grab some food at the restaurant up there. One of the restaurants isn’t nearly as expensive as people say it is. It all depends on what you’re eating. They have souvlaki for €3 if you really just want something cheap to enjoy while you take in the views. I had the spaghetti carbonara for €11 and thought it was delicious. After our late lunch, we got to see the sunset and nighttime from up on the mountain. Definitely a must.

We couldn't find the cable car either, but from Syntagma Square this walk isn't nearly as far as it looks. The trip down is pretty easy. Enjoy the huge cacti and flowers along the path on the way up. The view of the Acroplis from here is wonderful. Our hotel was by Hadrians arch and we walked to Lycabettus from there, went through the Plaka on the way back.

I definitely recommend to take the cable car up, it is 7,5€ round way per person. The ride up takes only a few minutes, but if it is a hot and sunny day it is definitely recommended. On the top you will go trough the restaurant to the top where you have a small church dating from 1800 hundreds, and around the church you have the most amazing view of the Athens area!

The restaurant we tried at the top is not that expensive depending on where in the world you come from. A 50cl beer was 6 euro compared to around 3.5-4.5 euro in town but still cheaper than a number of other countries. The gift shop at the cable car entrance at the base of the mountain has a nice range of keepsakes but is fairly expensive.

Well recommended!Tip: cable car costs €7.50 each way. Get a taxi for €10 instead, especially if there's more of you.\n",

It was a disappointment to the kids in the car because they were expecting the ride up with a view. However, once at the top, the spectacular view was well worth the money and the disappointing \"ride\" to the top.  You could see for miles and really appreciate the expanse and beauty of Athens.  You could also view the Acropolis among the urban sprawl of  the city, which really put things into perspective.  So if you are looking for a terrific view, this provides that view.  There is a trail that you can walk if you prefer to hike up instead of taking the cable car.  It is a well maintained sidewalk that loops its way to the top so it is doable even if you are not in the best of shape.  We took the walkway down and enjoyed it as well.  We did the trip during the late afternoon but I heard from others that it is really cool to do it at dusk so you could see the lights of the town.\n",

There are several places to access the trail but this was the most convenient way after navigating our way by foot from the Plaka where we were staying near the base of the Acropolis. Along the way we had stopped by the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Panathenaic Stadium and the National Gardens making it a very long but interesting journey. After crossing a couple of busy streets we zigged and zagged our way along one way streets through the tree lined Dexomeni neighborhood to the historic Dexomeni Park where we stopped at an outdoor cafe for a pit stop. This is just before you reach the start of the trail across from the hotel.The hike up the hill can be hot and still while at the same time but summit can be refreshingly breezy. Many people recognize Mount Lycabettus from looking across Athens from the Acropolis. The view back to the Acropolis across the streets and monuments of Athens makes this hike worthwhile. Other than drinking plenty of water and bringing along a good navigator I would recommend not touching the cactus that grow on the rocky slopes near the top of the hill. I was warned but I still wanted to find out how sharp the hairlike spines really were. They are sharp and they hurt and if you needed another reason to stay on the trail then the cactus are a very good reason.\n",

If you aren’t fit or of good health, you can take a taxi up most of the way up but you will still need to walk up several steps.There’s a Church, toilet facilities and a cafe at the top. What you go for though, is the breathtaking views of ALL of Athens. 360 degree view. It’s fantastic. It’s no wonder they call it the balcony of Athens. I can imagine getting there later in the day it may well be busy, but going before 10am, was quiet and enabled us to get some fantastic pictures and just really enjoy the view.I walked up in flip flops. They are sturdy ones, with a thick sole. I wouldn’t recommend walking up in any flimsy footwear due to some uneven ground in places. As always, make sure you take water with you when you’re walking up a mountain in the heat. There isn’t a fountain at the top, but as I said, there is a cafe but we didn’t use it.\n",

      "Review text is :Here's a place that offers a nice view of the City of Athens. In order to go up there you got the following options: 1. You enter Kolonaki region and you follow the road that will lead you to the big parking space. From there, you can have a very good view of Athens, but nothing more. If you want to go higher, you should follow the beautiful path and climb some stairs in order to make it ot the top. There, you will find a cafe/restaurant and the small Church of St. George. This is the best place you can go in my opinion.2. Again, you go to Kolonaki region, but you are heading to the \"cable\" car. Using the cable car, you will go up to the top in 1 minute, so it's far easier that way. But before you decide to go, try to learn the hours that is open.Also, it is better to climb up there at evening/night. It is more beautiful by far! Try to catch the sunset... ;-)\n",

Man, it was hot and hard, but I am glad that I walked all the way through the nicer area of Athens - Kolonaki, the apartments and shops are more upper-scale. I had to walked up lots of stairs to get to the trail-head, and stared the hike. I was soaking wet with sweat at 7:00pm. There is funicular to take  if you don't want to hike all the way.At the summit there is a cute tiny chapel and a tower, also a Sky Bar that you can get a drink at €5 and snack at under €10. Just relax and wait for the sunset.I was very lucky that I went on a full moon day and also the date with the Blood Moon. The moon was RED, so amazing, and you see Acropolis all iit-up under the dark sky, all these for FREE!! You just need to get there on foot!I hiked down after 10:00pm, and on my way back to hotel I stopped at couple bars and have drinks in that Kolonaki neighborhood.\n",

Moving on from the bad start the rest was beautiful amazing views even had a beer with locals and tourists at the top. It's a must visit in my view\n",

We made it as far as the Funicular and decided we had walked/climbed far enough. If it was a cooler day we would have walked all the way up. The Funicular is a little cable car that goes up an internal tunnel so there is no view. There is a weird light show on the ceiling that nobody quite understood, but that's okay. At the top is a restaurant with the most incredible views and a small church. It gets quite crowded in the lead up to sunset, but is well worth the effort as it is a spectacular view over the whole city.\n",

It’s also a high point in terms of one of the best tours ever.  A little back story...1968, I was in Athens and Greece on a college study tour and had visited Mt. Lycabettas and Cape Sounio. Fast forward to 2018 (yes almost 50 years to the day) and my wife and I visited both, this time with Dimitris, tour guide extraordinaire...of Private Greece Tours. I must say that this visit with only 3 people rather than 80 on my first trip was a whole lot more enlightened and personal.  (I review Cape Sounio-Temple of Poseidon and Private Greece Tours in separate reviews) Dimitris provided more details and interesting anecdotes then the first time...or maybe I paid attention more because of the size of the group.  In any case, Mt Lycabettas overlooks Athens and the view...incredible! Even the Acropolis, the other highest point in Athens, is easily seen among the seemingly close packed neighborhoods. The contrast of Modern Athens with Ancient Athens is obvious and needs no explanation. To paraphrase...”A view is worth a thousand words!”\n",

The food is very good and the prices are excellent. I got what is considered a snack size gyro, but it was pretty much full-size for me. You’ll want to get yourself a good spot to watch as the sunset sets over the mountains that are at the edge of Athens. There is no shade so bring water. A good camera and a zoom lens if you have one to get the best photos. If you’re in the right position you can see the sun setting through the bell free tower at the tip of the land where you’ll be standing. You are able to tour the church as well. The walk up is a little difficult. I saw more than a few people struggling and needing to rest. If you are not in good shape or are elderly you should take the funicular up. This hill and viewing point is the highest in Athens and gives you a birds eye view, as you can view the Acropolis from above it. Great view and fabulous sun sets.

When you reach the first restaurant, do not be deceived, as I nearly was, into thinking that this is the end of the road. Walk through the restaurant and keep following anything that leads upwards, until you finally reach the peak. Be advised - it's quite a long way up. You can do it easily, but it's pretty sweaty.

Follow the graduated foot path to Mount Lycabettus viewing area. 2) Take a cab to the Teleferik cable car station. Buy a cable car ticket either for one way or two ways and wait for the next operation schedule for the cable car. The wait could take up to more than 30 minutes or whenever there are sufficient number of passengers for the trip to materialise. However the cable car ride is just a short duration of 3-4 minutes The price for different categories of visitors are listed prominently. There’s also a souvenir and refreshment shop on site. Similarly the trip descending to the base of Mount Lycabettus would take you as much time as ascending it. So you could choose to walk down instead. 3) Similar to (2), one could walk up to the Teleferik cable car station along Ploutarchou Ave by ascending it’s never ending stairs and slopes along its lovely and quaint neighbourhood.4) Simply walk up to the base of Mount Lycabettus along Loukianou Ave. The slopes and stairs are less punishing than (3) and the distance is shorter. There are also numerous cafe along this stretch of road. At the end of this road just follow the winding path up to the top of Mount Lycabettus. At the viewing area of Mount Lycabettus, one could have an unobstructed all round view of Athens up to the ports at Piraeus. There’s a church of St George on site but it seems like perpetually closed. I think if one were to come on an evening, the night lights of the city of Athens would be mesmerising.\n",

Nope. The staff there have no idea what I was talking about and signal was so bad up there that I can't get hold of the website to show the info to them. Food came 35 mins after ordering and no apologies for the wait. Staff was rude and felt like forced to work.  At the top was another nightmare. People hogged the main area to take a picture so it was like a mass of sweaty bodies clumped together to get a decent picture without heads of the sunset and acropolis at night. when I went there in January at 1pm, there was literally 5 people and that was it. yeah it was 10°C but at least u get to take a panoramic picture and the cold tend to make people more humble. even the walk down was not bad. so lesson learnt, will never come back in the summer and never again will I dine at the restaurant there.\n",

We took a taxi to the main entrance and from there hiked to several vantage points for our nighttime photography session.  In mid-October, the weather in Athens was perfect and reminded me of southern California.  Warm and dry but not too hot.  It was a clear day and we expected a great view of the Acropolis.  More crowded than usual at our preferred viewpoint, we chose to hike further down the trail at a lower part of the hill but it still offered the right perspective for a decent composition.  I had lost track of time while observing the sunset and making images, and darkness fell very quickly as we finished our shoot.  On the way back down, I was surprised there was little to no lighting along the trail and had to watch my step carrying a full camera kit and tripod.  My guide had the presence of mind to use his phone as a flashlight.  Overall, a visit to Mount Lycabettus was the perfect ending to my first day in Athens.TIP: We discovered that taxis are very few a night.  What makes this experience memorable for me was the walk down the road in search for a ride.  Fortunately the surrounding residential area is very safe.  Having a guide really paid off at this point as he called a taxi company and eventually we were picked up.\n",

There is a chapel, and two restaurants, and as we were on a tour went up by the funicular railway.This was a journey of around four minutes and a good experience.  There are no views from the funicular though, advertising and lights flash across the roof and walls during the journey.  Not like a disco lol but certainly different..We would have liked to have walked down but apparently the walking route takes you to a different point to the start of the funicular.  There is a small shop at the bottom and two cafe/restaurants at the top.  There are also toilets although the ones on the higher level near the k grill are hard to find - ask for help to find them.There is also a chapel, and I hear a theatre/amphitheatre  too but didn’t see that.Make the effort to come up and take in the views !  It’s definitely worth it though we were sad not to get to see the views at night too which we are told are stupendous with the city lit up! The K grill had some appetising sounding food too at a reasonable price but didn’t have time to eat here.\n",

The view of the Acropolis is actually much better at the many rooftop restaurants and hotels in Syntagma than at Lycabettus, which is over twice as far away. We ended up staying just 15 minutes at the top before riding the cable car back down.If you want to exercise, it's not a bad idea to walk up and down and skip the cable car.

      "Review text is :Read all reviews with a grain of salt and exercise discernment. I read several negative reviews, didn't really care for the tourist trap, but good thing my friend wanted to go. It was an excellent decision.0) First of all, when & how & why you get up there, and what you do once there will pretty much determine the degree of your satisfaction. I list some cautions and hopefully great advice below. Go before or after the ruins are closed to visit. You can't visit any official historic/cultural sites, might as well spend it on Mt Lycabettus. Dusk was excellent time.1) Don't take the funicular ride through a dark tunnel, unless that's one of a kind experience you've always wanted to have. The whole point of climbing a hill is to see the varying vistas along the way. You have to climb the foothills to get to the \"station\", wait in line, buy a ticket, wait some more for the cable car to show up, all inside a building. Why? That's like driving 0.5 mile to the clubhouse to workout in the gym.2) A taxi driver at Zeus Temple offered us a ride up there for €30, if you wish to minimize the stair climbing, that's a good option. There are 2 spots way up there where a car can take you, on the northeast side, there is a huge parking lot, still a long walk to walk but much few steps. On the south face, there is a road that dead ends some what far up the hill where locals parked along the road, a taxi driver would know. That's a good alternative, probably cheaper than the funicular if there is more than one of you. Don't worry about getting down, it is so fast and easy, no reason to ride anything.3) Walk it. Compared to our climb from harbour to Mt Eros (580 m elev) on Hydra Island, this is a walk in the park. Okay, not really, but if you are reasonably healthy, and not unfit (I have never hiked or climbed mountains and never go to the gym and do not run or exercise, it's no big deal for me though mid 50's and have aches and pains in my back, thigh, arm, shoulders, etc. you get the point, it's really not an arduous climb like so many reviewers claimed but then, they are Americans!)  Because it's quite steep, even the ramped portion can stress your cardiovascular system, just don't push or rush it. Take your time and many breaks. The climb down, that's really easy, just don't wait until the light is gone, several of us had to resort to smart phone torch lest we make a misstep and fall down the hill.4) How best to go. We took the subway to St Evangelist stop, right next to it to the west is the War Museum (didn't bother, couple fighters parked outside), further west the Byzantine Museum (the ground is an awesome example of landscape architecture design, the villa is quite stately & impressive, but we didn't go in). Next is Aristotle's Lyceum, there is nothing to see just archeological dig of foundations of what was there, excellent botanical plantings & nicely designed landscape features & furniture (benches), but it is where Aristotle taught & the notion of well-rounded classical education, body, mind & spirit. Reading the plaques was very educational. Helps if one has read the writings & history of the storied Athenian philosophers which I haven't.5) Don't take the Ploutarchou road, everyone tells you to. It dead ends at the cable stop. There is no path or stairs or signage for walkers. Take the street called Loukianou, one block west over which starts at the Byzantine Museum & ends near the dirt path that leads to paved ramps & stone steps. Up to this point, you are already climbing through the paved city with terrible uniform housing high-rises all around you, but a mere 10% to 20% of the elevation, and if by the time you got here you are already breathless, skip the stairs, go to the cable car. Don't end up in ER in a foreign land.6) Persevere & don't curse me. The point of going up to a peak isn't just for the exhileration, the foreplay is important which makes the climax so much more rewarding. The top plaza fronts tiny St George & affords views looking south & west & north. There is always a crowd & each tourist for himself. A redhead and her beau sat at the western apex, the best spot & ignored everyone else for the entire time we were up there, as are others who have time to kill. They won't yield their seats. You have to look around, spot people who are short-timers, they've got other places to go things to do, stand behind them, endure all their posing & conversations, some even on the phone because they just wish to share this incredible moment with those who can't be there. You know, how considerate of them! Then take their spot, take your shots, look intensely for a few seconds, OK, minutes if you must, then YIELD the real estate. Don't do unto others what was done unto you. Be kind. There are a lot of wickedly selfish people on top of Mt. Lycabettus. If you are one of those who believe in inherent human goodness, your time up there will change your mind. Most people are selfish pricks, given the chance, like on tiny St George plaza on Mt Lycabettus, that's the caution for the climb, you get to observe human depravity once you get there.7) There is a flag lowering ceremony by 3 soldiers. Greek soldiers, don't know what to say, but they do make lots of noises with their shoes. If you saw the changing of guards at the Hellenistic Parliament, this is like it, but less pomp & circumstance.8) There is no view of the Parthenon or the Acropolis from here, way too far. If you go there for that, you will be disappointed, unless you brought your binoculars or long telephoto lens, which would make the climb all the more difficult. Otherwise you won't see any ruins, just panorama of the city & its mountains & the sea. It's quite a sight, truly, we were there at dusk, too bad it wasn't one of those glorious sunsets, still, it's worth the climb.9) Greek tragedy. There was a middle-age man, not lean, in the middle of the plaza with an ice-box, buy a beverage from him. All the tourists seemed afraid to even ask how much. He needs to change his attire tactics, making it fun like the Turkish ice-cream hawker performer. I think he sold less than a handful of drinks. I wasn't thirsty & after that long a climb up, I am sitting down at a table & take in the view & have my beverage served in a nice glass.10) Do yourself a favour, do go down a short flight on the NE end & find yourself a seat on the terrace of the restaurant/bar. For some reason, there isn't a maître d' to get you a nice spot. Whoever complained it's expensive have no idea what they are talking about. Beer for €5, cocktails for €9, appetisers for between €6-12, even the main entree is cheap (with options under €20) if you consider its location (total monopoly) and the views. The cafes in Plaka charge more than this. Just think if you went up to the Hyatt Regency in their revolving bar or restaurant anywhere else in the world, you would pay way more than this. We each had a drink, water was complimentary & ordered 2 finger food, they were EXCELLENT, beautifully presented & tasted GREAT, adding in a tip, came to €30! That's less than the cheap taxi ride to the airport.  Ignore the folks who bad mouthed the restaurant, treat yourself to a relaxed time, sitting on top of the (Athenian) world, enjoy a drink, some refreshments, and soak in the Athenian sky and its magical light. You have arrived at your destination, enjoy the fruits of your hard labor. Keep in mind it can be windy and a bit chilly depending on the weather. Now they do have dining areas that are enclosed or roofed over, but you didn't come all this way to be inside a building!So few people patronised the terrace restaurant, and too bad they didn't open the lower terrace that has a southern view, while the plaza is jammed pack with tourists. I think most just figure it's gonna cost them an arm & a leg, so they didn't bother. What a missed opportunity for a truly inexpensive meal or refreshment! I commented to my German friend, they should put their menu out on the plaza, or pay the church rent to have it on its side walls. I bet that would give them at least a ten fold increase in patronage.\n",

The view at the top was limited unless you wanted to go into the restaurant which was built in a manner that excludes you being able to walk round and see a 360 degree view. No where much to walk unless you wish to descend which is pointless if you bought a round trip funicular ticket. My first time at Mt. Lycabettus although we have been to Athens before. I would not repeat the exercise and would not recommend it. My main aim in going up was to see the Parthenon because from the Acropolis you can see Mt. Lycabettus however it was not possible so I presume that sight is saved for those going into the restaurant.\n",

We did visit and were not disappointed.  The views are absolutely stunning.  What I didn't appreciate until we got there, is that you can either walk up and down, or else get a funicular style railway ride up to the top, which I think was 5 Euros each for one way, or 7.5 Euros both ways.  We took the railway up and walked down.  The 360 degree views of Athens from the top are absolutely stunning and there is a beautiful tiny Church at the top that you can look around.  There is also a bar/restaurant where you can rest whilst taking in the views.  The walk up/down is on good paths and steps, so is easily doable, depending on your level of fitness and how hot it is.  We discovered on our short trip to Athens, that if you try and hail a taxi outside or close to a tourist attraction, that you will be charged perhaps 3 times what you would if you walk on for just a few minutes.  We always asked the fare before we got in and declined if we felt we were being ripped off.  The yellow cab Taxi drivers we actually used, were all lovely and really informative about Athens.\n",

Went for dinner in the restaurant which is reasonably priced, and waited until dark.  The hilltop has 360 pana views of Athens from the top and the night scene was amazing.  It can be extremely windy at the top of the hill though so wrap up in winter. Got some great shots of the Acropolis in day and night.Would recommend the railway which is open until 3am! as the path back down is unlit and, in my view, a little dodgy looking.  The neighbourhood around the bottom of the railway seems pretty safe, we were happy to walk around there at night without a worry.Absolute must for anyone visiting Athens.\n",

On the top of the hill there is an Orthodox church, several cafes or taverns.. There is a funicular supposed to take you up, but I could not find it.

It's only about a 10 minute walk from Syntagma Square to the Kolonaki district and then it's easy to find the path to the top. The small chapel of St George is worth a visit, but primarily you will be spotting the main landmarks of Athens old and new - be sure to identify the port of Piraeus in the distance, beyond the Acropolis. Closer at hand you'll locate the Panathanaikos Stadium, and the Temple of Olympian Zeus.

By the time we had climbed all of the flights of stairs up to the funicular station we were utterly exhausted. There are hundreds and hundreds of them. However it also gave us the chance to see the nice area where this hill is situated which was some distance away from where we were staying. The Funicular runs every 30 minutes on the hour and on the half hour. It costs seven euro per person for the return trip. There really is nothing to see while you go up however as it is inside a tunnel. Although there are random words flashed up in a light sure on the tunnel wall as you go up, this appears to be simply advertising for Metaxa which is a Greek drink. The entrance to the funicular is in a building with Metaxa written on the side and it is made out of yellow-ish glass. Ones at the top of the hill you get a really good view of the whole of the city, especially the Acropolis. It is easy to spend half an hour just wondering around looking at the views. There is a restaurant at the top also if you want to stay longer. However we just stayed for half an hour and then went back down again.

It's an amazing, 360-degrees unrestricted view of the entire city of Athens and the surrounding mountains.Getting there is easy. Personally I'd suggest walking - it's not as hard as you might think. From below (i.e. the city center) it seems tall and menacing, but there are clearly marked paths, stairs, and all-in-all an average person doesn't need more than 30-40min to walk there from Syntagma square. If you don't walk to walk, AVOID the funicular. It's much better (especially if you're in a group of 2-3 ppl) to simply get a cab that takes you almost all the way up there (there are a few stairs left when the road ends) for a very small price.There is a cafe-restaurant on the top, where you can get snacks or refreshments at reasonable prices. There is also a very picturesque church.\n",

After that we returned to the cafe hoping for a coffee and light meal, but again struggled to attract the attention of a waiter, and sitting around 4 or 5 tables each with people smoking, we decided we may as well just go back down. When we reached the bottom we hailed a taxi who wanted €15 to take us back to our hotel, but we declined his rip-off offer as it only cost €7 to get up there. Sadly we waited for over half an hour in the dark for another taxi before giving up and deciding to walk back. When we asked the cable car cashier to call us a taxi she said no and assured us another taxi would arrive but this did not happen. So a very nice view for at a highly publicised tourist destination was badly let down by terrible wait service and appalling public transport support.Our tips - bypass the cafe, just enjoy the views and pre-book your return taxi.\n",

      "Review text is :Standing about 300 meters above sea level, Lycabettus Hill is the highest point of Athens. Take a walk to the top to see the view, one of the best ways to spend a morning or late afternoon in Athens. The hill is a tourist destination and can also be ascended by the funicular railway which climbs the hill from a lower terminus at Kolonaki (The railway station can be found at Aristippou street). The view from Lycabettus Hill is best enjoyed at sunset. At its two peaks are the 19th century Chapel of St. George, and a restaurant with a very nice view. There is also a large open-air amphitheatre at the top, which has housed many Greek and international concerts. Among the artists who have performed at the Lycabettus theatre included Ray Charles, Joan Baez, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Paco De Lucia, Al Di Meola, John Mc Laughlin, Gary Moore, Peter Gabriel, Black Sabbath, Nick Cave, Pet Shop Boys, Deep Purple, UB40, Placebo, Morrissey, Radiohead, Moby, Massive Attack, Faithless, Whitesnake, Tracy Chapman, Nightwish, Slipknot, Patti Smith, Vanessa Mae, Brian Ferry, Tito Puente, Buena Vista Social Club, Orishas and Scorpions.

You can walk up to the funicular railway, provided you don't mind stairs. I walked from my hotel in Plaka and it took about 20 - 30 minutes. Once you reach the railway ( also accessible by taxi or Metro), round trip tickets are 7 euros. The railway leaves every 30 minutes until closing at 3 am in summer. The views are stunning and you can look down onto the Acropolis and all the way to the sea. It is possible to have 360 degree views and there is a cute little church at the peak. There is also a cafe and restaurant with fantastic views. Would be great at dinner time. I highly recommend a visit here if you have the time (about 2 -3 hours).\n",

We took a taxi to the highest point that they could drive, and then walked up. We stopped for lunch at the restaurant there; I personally would recommend going somewhere else to eat, as the service was subpar with a long wait for coffees and just mediocre food (we could have forgiven the long food wait, but the french fries they served were cold). However, the view of the city at the top was worth the trip. We went mid-afternoon; I would try to go again during sunset. We took the funicular (Teleferik) on the way down. I wasn't super impressed by it, since the ride is in the actual mountain, and it's only a few minutes; however, it definitely beat walking. Overall, a pleasant afternoon but not something I would say to a first-time Athens tourist with only few days' time, \"Wow, you should really do this!\"\n",

But up until the beginning of the 20th century the sacred olive grove with over 150,000 trees shimmered silver-green in the bright Athenian sunlight. These trees derived from the first sacred olive tree: the goddess Athena's gift to Athens. It is from this tree that Plato's Academy acquired its twelve olive trees. Aristotle said that whoever harmed any of these trees would face the death penalty! Every four years the city of Athens gave over 2,000 panathenaic amphorae to the winners of her games- over 70 tons of oil! Sadly, from the early 1900s because of urbanization and the influx of refugees from the Asia Minor catastrophe the destruction of this beautiful, vast forest was imminent.\n",

The Acropolis lights come on just after sunset. The funicular (\"Teleferik\") ride was not crowded at all, and the round trip price is now 7.50 euro.It takes about 5 minutes.  Taxi from the city center should be about 8 euro. On the way back, there will be taxis waiting at the bottom station, and you should expect to be ripped off. I thought I had studied everything about the taxi fares, but I got stumped when the driver said the price is double at night, and I didn't recall what the night hours and rates were, nor hours were. (The night rate applies from midnight to 5 am, and the rate per km increases from 0.74 euro to 1.29 euro - hardly double, and we were going at 9 pm. So the driver lied - surprise, surprise!)But the view is worth it, even considering the 15 euro taxi ride back to the city center. You can walk from Syntagma square to the Teleferik station in about 15 minutes (two-thirds of a mile, or about 1 km) Check Google for the sunset time for that day, and be there about 30 minutes before, stay as long as you like. There is also a restaurant at the top.\n",

People say it's expensive but it's the same as any decent restaurant in the states. Great sunset views over the city. Take the tram up and walk down through the neighborhoods after. If you follow the stairs down you will run into a bunch of cool bars that are more local. This ended up being our favorite night in Athens. Cabs are hard to find near the tram station so waking maybe your onlyOption to get back into Athens city center.\n",

You get a good view of the houses etc below. Also can see Acropolis and old Olympic stadium etc... pretty much a bunch of white looking houses below. There were 2 or 3 restaurants up the top.

      "Review text is :Loved the views over Athens and watching the sunset with a glass of wine. Be warned - the glass of wine and two beers took 45 mins to arrive. The young Aussie girls who brought a picnic and wine certainly had the right idea. Recommend the cable car. We walked from Athens city centre - lots and lots and did I say lots of steps to the furnicular. Taxis can take you to the cable car which I would recommend for anyone not fit or infirm. Orizonte is the restaurant on the hill - it is expensive and although they confirmed our reservation for a table for 3 by the wall for uninteruppted views of the sunset our table was not by the wall and was a table for 2. They did change it for a table for 3 after arguing that I only booked for 2. They aslo argied that the confirmation is automated so they don't confirm special requests and then went on to contradict themselves by saying they had other booking for the wall before us. Their attitude was very, very unusal for the lovele Greek people. We left. Unfortunately, Orizonte also has an interset and monopoly in the cafe. So it doesn't matter to them whether you ea at the restaurant because they own the cafe as well!. What really shocked us was the fact that the waiter who was looking after us was run off her feet. She was absolutely lovely. We found out that if people leave without paying the cost  of their drinks and or meals then she has to pay for it. The management of Orizonte and their cafe is terrible.\n",

      "Review text is :Lycabettus is one of two hills in the centre of Athens, and it is absolutely beautiful with some of the most stunning views of the city. The other hill is, of course, the Acropolis. You can walk up the Hill, which is what we did. There are steps from various places. The steps can be a little demanding, depending on your fitness level, but you can stop now and then, so you will not be exhausted by the time you reach the top. There are several hundred steps, I think, but they are worth it. There is only a very small chapel at  the top of the hill and an entrepreneurial drinks sales man! That's all! And of course a few dozen visitors enjoying the wonderful views of the city and beyond. It is like a dream. You have to be there to really appreciate the beauty o9f the place. There are different stories about the naming of the hill, and one is that it derives from the name for 'wolf', which in Greek is \"lykos\", or \"lycos\". So the place was meant to be 'the place where wolves went, or took refuge\", hence \"Lycabettus\". Interesting!\n",

We didn't take the funicular train up - we had a taxi take us halfway up and wait for our return - all the taxi drivers know where to go - and we walked the rest of the way which took about 5 minutes. We went at night to see the city and the Acropolis lit up.  It was breathtaking!  This is the highest point in Athens - almost 1,000 feet above the city.  Anytime you go is a great time to go.  Most people love going at sunset - too crowded for me.  I prefer to see the city at night all lit up with less people around me.  It's a personal preference.  There is also an amazing restaurant up there.  You can make a night of it.  When in Athens - there are 3 places, in my opinion, which can't be missed...Acropolis, Sounion and Mt. Lycabettus.  You won't regret going - and it really doesn't take too much time at all.\n",

The driver insisted that he could take us further up the mountain and that it would be a very short walk to the top. Unfortunately, it was a very steep climb, which was not short at all, and considering I had my 75 year old mother in law with me, I would've thought the driver would have been more considerate. So we eventually made it to the top after many rest breaks and sat down at the restaurant to order lunch- which was pleasant. The view is amazing from the restaurant and from the top of the hill. We travelled back down using the cable car- no problems. We grabbed a taxi at the bottom and asked our driver to take us back to Monastiraki where we were staying. He was very pleasant and we enjoyed his conversation. But- he decided he wouldn't take us directly to our apartment and dropped us off at a point of his choosing. He told us it was a short, easy walk back- but it wasn't! Very frustrated with our taxi drivers today!\n",

We took the tram to the Syntagma station and walked the remainder of the way using our Around Me app.   We stumbled upon the Hi-Fai Grill House (highly recommend) where we had a snack before our long walk up the hill.    We rambled through winding streets and were helped along by some passersby who could tell we were looking for Mount Lycabettus.   We took the funicular to the top and paid for the ride back down as well.   But I wanted to walk down.   So I took a path down and then my husband decided to walk down after I had left the top of the hill.   Luckily we could text message to locate each other as we took paths down on opposite sides of the hill.   (there are many walking paths so I recommend you stay with your group if walking).    We met back at the St. George Hotel as that was the only close landmark that we both knew.  The views from the Lycabettus are amazing and it's worth the trip.\n",

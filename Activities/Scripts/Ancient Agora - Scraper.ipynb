If you want to properly experience it without rushing I recommend going after lunch, bringing plenty of water and allocating a few hours to this place.There's a museum in the main Stoa building which displays a lot of artifacts found in the area and explains some of the customs. There's plenty of statues, ruins, nature, etc to admire. There's a temple there which is very well preserved despite suffering from a fire. In general, I think you will find this one of the more interesting in visually stimulating sites to visit in Athens. If you've taken the metro you might have seen this site from underneath as the metro line runs directly through it.We truly enjoyed our time there, just wish we went there after lunch so we wouldn't be rushing so much.\n",

It was such an incredibly hot day and there wasn't much shade in some parts so make sure you apply/reapply sunscreen if you go during the summer. You buy tickets for this place at the front follow RS's instructions through the artifacts. He even guides you through the little museum inside the rebuilt market. The temple inside is also very beautiful. It's worth taking a look and taking a few pictures with. The one downside was that the back exit gate that leads to the Acropolis is closed. Since it was such a hot day, we ended up not walking to the Acropolis from the Agora and took an Uber instead. Hint: I'd highly recommend Ubers over a Taxi since paying for the ride is more convenient.\n",

      "Review text is :We thoroughly enjoyed over two hours strolling throughout this superb area admiring the evocative remains of what was the centre of daily civic life in antiquity.It was fascinating to learn that it was in use for millennia before becoming the Civic Centre of the City, including as a cemetery during the latter Bronze Age. But undoubtedly it’s as the former that is best reflected in the great remnants and restorations.A gorgeous intricate Corinthian Capital is to be seen, as is a fine statue of Emperor Hadrian, who foremost of the Romans contributed most to Athens. Only the torso survives but it exquisitely shows a wolf suckling the twins Romulus and Remus of Roman legend and the Goddess Athena standing atop the wolf.  A number of Stoa are displayed - South Stoa I, possibly used by metronomoi who were officials in charge of weights and measures; Middle Stoa that dates from around 180 BCE; and the undoubted jewel that is the Stoa of Attalos.Wonderfully restored in the 1950s it hosts the interesting Agora Museum with artefacts including fascinating Ostraca that were used to vote to banish or ostracise citizens. A lovely Byzantine Church of Agios Apostoloi with grand stone craft is well worth perusing. It is one of only two original edifices in the complex. The second is the gorgeous stunning Temple of Hephaestus, completed in 415 BCE and one of the highlights. A vista of Pentelic marble columns against the saturated early morning blue was delightful. Regarded as one of the best preserved Greek temples from antiquity it is a marvellous treasure.A Dais that bore ten bronze sculptures representing the Tribes of Athens is still evocative after more than two millennia. It is known as the Monument of the Eponymous Heroes  Vestiges of Altars and Temples to numerous Deities are extant, including to Ares the Olympian Deity who was God of the Spirit of Battle. Further Altars are to Zeus and Zeus Agoraios, a most powerful God.Impressive and ornate with arrays of Corinthian columns, the grand Odeon of Agrippa was a gift to the Athenians from Emperor Augustus’s Son-in-Law. Impressive sculptures line the outlines and the fine performance space could accommodate an audience of around 1000.  A water mill residue comprising two large circular mill stones is a further fascinating picture of ancient life, as is the Great Drain that provided essential drainage preventing flooding in the Agora.\n",

      "Review text is :The Ancient Agora is huge and we needed a good few hours to get around everything. There was a good museum there with some of the art and statues taken from the site. Well preserved with some conservation work still ongoing, we were glad of our guidebook to supplement the information boards as we went round.Interesting that the government was by an administrative assembly (boule), which was made up of 50 people from each of the 10 tribes of Athens, 500 governors in total that served for a period of 35 days each before swapping, so by the end of the year, all tribes had been represented.(10 month year at this stage). There was the remains of one if the most important buildings that hosted debates and was also where goods were measured, a kind of weights and measures department (tholos).Lots of temples and historical buildings or remains of them. I was interested to learn about the history of Athens, before the Romans invaded in 86 BC. They developed a strong economy and were doing ok for centuries, then the Persians invaded and knocked them flat, robbing them of their wealth and treasures. They picked themselves up and became even stronger over the next 300 years, but then the Romans invaded in 86 BC, and were in power until around 500 AD, so they haven't had it easy really. A lot of the Ancient sites we saw are from the Roman era, but not all, and it was good to see the whole story.In the Ancient Agora there is the middle stoa which would have been a place for business and commerce and also for people to meet one another. It was said that Socrates would have frequented here.Apparently also Socrates was held in the prison here and it was here that he died after taking hemlock. Very sad, and I didn't know of the circumstances of his death.  As suspected, turns out he was accused by the authorities of anti democratic teaching but really it was questioning the authority of the deities, for which  he was found guilty and was executed by being made to drink hemlock. I'm not sure if that makes me feel better about it or not, knowing that he didn't choose to go that way.Spent nearly 3 hours here.\n",

The collection of the museum includes clay, bronze and glass objects, sculptures, coins and inscriptions from the 7th to the 5th century BC, as well as pottery of the Byzantine period and the Turkish occupation. The exhibition within the museum contains work of art which describes the private and public life in ancient Athens. In 2012, new sculpture exhibition was added to the museum which includes portraits from Athenian Agora excavation. The new exhibition revolves around portraits of idealized gods, officially honored people of the city, wealthy Roman citizens of the 1st and 2nd century AD, 3rd-century citizens and finally on work of art from private art schools of late antiquity.\n",

The first floor contains many artifacts displayed very well.  It has ice cold water from a drinking fountain near the bathrooms. The second floor is an arcade with many sculptures, and a fantastic view of the complex.  Though signage is poor, make sure to go to the Hephaisteion (also called Theselon) across the property opposite the museum.  This temple is well preserved date to about 400 BC.  Another highlight here are the Triton statues.Tip: The best deal is to pay 30 euro for the 5-day tickets that includes The Acropolis and slopes, Ancient Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Kerameikos, Roman Agora, Olympieion [Temple of Olympian Zeus], and Aristotle’s School Lykeion.\n",

There is little in English to teach you about the sites so download Rick Steve’s audio guide/App to your phone or research in advance to appreciate what you see in Ancient Agora.Agora is known for the most preserved temple, the only one with the roof still intact -the Temple of Hephaestus. It is roped off so you cannot go inside, but you can walk around and admire the details and the grandness of it. It invokes a feeling of awe. It’s up on a hill so you will need to walk up some steps.Also, at the other end you will find the Stoa of Attalos, a two story building that has been restored and is now a museum. The Stoa is the old marketplace so it’s a long building with many columns and headless statues on the ground level. There is a museum with ancient artifacts from this site from pre history times!  Upstairs are statues, busts and models of the site. There is a nice view of Ancient Agora as well.Agora is also the home to the Holy Apostle church, Gymnasium, Odeon Agrippa, and temple Apollo Patroos.Definitely get the multi site ticket for 30€ so you can skip the line to buy tickets at all the sites and save time and money when you visit more than one site. You also get to visit the Acropolis temples, Hadrian’s Library, Roman Agora, Zeus Olympian temple, Aristotle’s school Leikion, and Kerameikos cemetery.There is so much to see here you do not want to miss it!

We had downloaded Rick Steve's free audio guide and we are no history buffs but it gives just the right amount of facts and things to look out for without being too much or boring for our daughter, without the guide we would mostly have been looking at loads of marble rubble that  had no meaning to us. The audio guide also gave us different things to look for in the little museum, it even tells you where the toilets and water fountains are. We all agreed we enjoyed our visit. It was relaxing, interesting and as you are so close to all the shops and restaurants you can stop for a refreshment before or after you leave\n",

The map clearly shows how distant the Acropolis was (? separation of church and state in the oldest form?) and the sporting stadium as well.  Everything from city hall and public records to libraries was within the Agora.  I get it now.\n",

When I entered the small museum, the ladies in charge informed me and some visitors that it would close in ten minutes' time. To emphasise the point, they began to turn off the lights as I took a hurried look at the exhibits. The ancient artefacts looked interesting, but I was only allowed a few minutes to examine them. Outside again, I picked my way across the site by the Middle Stoa and walked towards the Temple of Hephaistos. Just as I approached it, a man began to ring a bell and shout that everyone should make their way to the exit. When I tried to take a photo of the elegant temple, the battery in my camera suddenly gave out. However, I took a good look at the temple, which is in remarkably good condition, and gradually did make my way to the exit, having seen little or nothing of the rest of the site. Annoyed by the brusque treatment by the staff, I told the lady at the gate that my tour had been very rushed but unsurprisingly she made no apology. I left well before seven o'clock. A disappointing experience.\n",

There is a route map in there too but some of the way is rerouted so take the stairs on the Agora facing side of the temple down. And the map isn’t on scale so we walked right past the statue (after the temple). Which is just after the stairs. In the museum look for the numbers he’s mentioning on the right corner of the glass. But there are other free tour available.\n",

If you were on top of The Acropolis you probably saw structures of the Agora while taking in the city views. The Agora is available in a combination ticket with the other major attractions so look into that option when you arrive at your first ticket booth. The Agora contains many things to see including a museum, monuments, temples, garden grounds and a spectacular view of The Acropolis. You can easily spend the better part of the afternoon or morning at this one location if you look at everything. The Temple of Hephaestus alone is worth entering the Agora as it is the most intact of the Athenian structures.\n",

The main entrance is off Adrianou (signage from the Acropolis is non-existent, there did seem to be another entrance at the back but this was closed since it was the Low Season) We spent 1-2 hours exploring the site which was good value for money at €4 each. Being a big Socrates fan it was great to see where he discussed philosophy, a lot of the site is in ruins with Information boards describing how the buildings were used. The impressive and intact Stoa of Attalos with its Museum and the Temple of Hephaestus were definitely my favourite parts. It was also great to see the Panathenaic Pathway and learn about its history and the views up to the Acropolis are sublime too. A worthwhile visit!\n",

There are bits of ancient Athens which though ruins have not been redeveloped though much of the stone had been taken and re-used elsewhere over the centuries. For most of Agora you just see the footprint of buildings and the odd pillar, but it once was a very important place in ancient times where Greek philosophers used to meet up and stroll around together discussing weighty matters. You could say it was the cradle of Western civilisation in fact. From it there was a direct path to the Acropolis and it must have been marvellous when the buildings were standing and the local population were going about their business. One place they would have gone was the local temple which miraculously is still there and is the most complete Greek temple anywhere. I don’t remember it’s name but you can’t miss it if you go there. You can’t go in it, but it’s a wonder to wander around it imagining ancient times. A re-built building based on the ancient buidings houses a museum. It’s well worth a visit.\n",

AGORA has the meaning of an old public market, where people used to spend free time among each others, changing opinions or debating over topics that used to be important for them at the moment. Indeed, among and near these centuries old things you can definitely feel the vibe of the life as it was back then, both simple and full of senses and truths that are still valid nowadays.

Wandering around these spectacular ruins with so much historical significance during the course of one hour I saw no other humans except for a Filipino couple taking selfies. A black cat, a parrot, and several blackbirds were the only forms of life I otherwise encountered. My advice is to first head to the museum to pick up their \"Ancient Agora\" plan as these were not available at the ticket booth. Then set forth on your visit in a clockwise manner, taking your time to get to the Temple of Hephaistos. Then after finishing your walk have a look at the museum.The one area I was most interested in seeing is actually outside the gates in between the street and railway tracks: The Stoa Poikile, or Painted Porch. It was here Zeno of Citium taught Stoicism. It was painted with resplendent frescoes and later had famous paintings such as \"The Taking of Troy\" by Polygnotus; what an odd fate that laying track for the Hellenic Electrical Railway in the late 19th-century ruined the ruins and that this once-famous ancient repository of art is partially covered in modern graffiti!That said the grounds are not particularly well kept up and some of the signage appears decades old. Perhaps that's actually fitting for when you have the place all to yourself; it seems haunted by figures from antiquity.\n",

The museum on site is interesting with lots and lots of information on the various eras in Athens, as well as info on the archaeological pieces they have on show. I particularly enjoyed the story of ostracism. This was a form of voting they used in ancient Athens to get rid of people who they believed were insurgents. A quorum of 6000 people were required. They carved out the name of the person on a piece of pot who they felt was a troublemaker or who was possibly a threat to Athens. The person with the most votes had to leave Athens for 10 years. Fantastic piece of info! There is yet another temple looking down on the Agora. Interestingly, while in the Acropolis, you can see this well preserved temple, low down in the city. Yet, while there, you have a climb to get up to it. This sort of positioning puts the Acropolis into perspective. Even without the 5 site ticket, the Ancient Agora is well worth a visit.\n",

      "Review text is :We walked all day at the Ancient Agora in the footsteps of Socrates and Plato on September 30, our last day of 2 weeks in Greece. It was the cultural dream of a lifetime. “You want ancient? We've got to see the Ancient Agora,” my husband said. Although Hurricane Zorba was pounding Athens a second day, the Agora is in a valley so less exposed to wind than Acropolis hill, and the cruise ships were gone from the day before, so hardly any crowds. Next time we'll check Piraeus port schedule to plan to avoid ship days.To walk to the Agora,we headed north from our hotel on Erechthiou St again, then north of the Acropolis (see my review of Art Gallery Hotel). We planned to take Rovertou Galli and Apostolou Pavlou St. to the Agora's south entrance, by walking around the west side of the Acropolis--a short stroll.  But we had to stop again and again all along Apostolou Pavlou St., in awe of each different view of the Parthenon in the distance.Then just outside the Agora, suddenly history wasn't distant. At our feet we stumbled on the Stenopos Kollytos ruins, ancient marble homes with beautiful tiled floors like the House of the Roman Mosaic (photo 1). It was all in the open because Athens has too many treasures to enclose, mansion after mansion, a whole town. Kollytos was one of the districts into which Athens was divided. It was the home district of Plato.  We found the foot path to the south entrance of the Agora, just across Apostolou Pavlou from Thision Cinema—but the path was completely flooded by the storm.  So we walked all the way to the north end of the Agora, enjoying the ever-changing Parthenon views, to enter the Agora's main entrance near Monastiraki Square Metro. Once inside the Agora, a huge complex of buildings and ruins in many different states, we found we couldn't identify 2/3 of what we were seeing, as some have noted. But don't skip the Agora—it's fabulous. Please just do the research! I wished I'd done a lot of studying maps before hand. But luckily we had an online mp3 audio guide to the Agora, so we could identify most of the sites inside the complex. We began on the Agora's east side at the Stoa of Attalos, a reconstruction of the long vaulted marketplace once at the Agora's entrance. Now it's a museum with some of the world's most amazing sculptures (photo 2). Then we toured the  Middle Stoa, once perpendicular to the Stoa of Attalos, running east to west.  It's  just pillars now, but it was huge. Walking along the Middle Stoa across the width of the whole Agora, we imagined ourselves among all the people shopping and working there every day and so many historical events.On the west side of the Agora, we climbed a small hill to the Temple of Hephaistos, the beautiful “miniature Parthenon” inside the Agora (photo 3). The view of the Agora from that hillside is a wow.  It shows that in Socrates' day, the Agora was linked by broad paths to the Acropolis, so the Acropolis was not isolated, but integral to the Agora (photo 4). People did  business at the stoas in the Agora valley, then walked as if by nature up the Acropolis to honor the gods at the Parthenon. It was a world in which the material and the spiritual were coherent.\n",

Two buildings are well preserved and or restored on the site. . First is the Temple of Hephaistos dating originally to ca. 450 BC. As with many ancient buildings in Greece it was converted to a church, this one Agios Georgios in the seventh century. Evidence of street fighting during the 1820's Greek resistance to Turkish occupation can be found on several columns.Also in this site is the 1000 AD Church of the Holy Apostles, a small Byzantine church  known for it's being the prototype for later churches.

The Stoa has been converted into a nice little museum with collections of some of the artifacts found on the grounds of the Agora, although the National Archaeology Museum has by far a more impressive collection.

We visited after going up the Acropolis & it is quite a long walk to the entrance of the agora.  There used to be an entrance up near the Acropolis but it had a chain & padlock on the gate.  There was no queue to get in at 10am.\n",

It's a tranquil haven for history buffs. The restored Stoa of Atallos houses innumerable sculptures on two floors. The Hephaestion is the best preserved temple of its kind anywhere in the world. The Church of the Holy Apostles is a small gem of early Christian sanctity. Views up to the Acropolis give you a genuine sense of what it was to be here in classical times. I'm not sure any other place in the world can do that, though I stand to be corrected. You can get entrance as part of a 30 euro package that include the Acropolis And the Roman Agora. But it's free for U18s and EU students (get on this year fellow Brit students) though you may need to provide proof.\n",

As a student of Ancient Greek and Greek history, I was overcome by the quality of the ruins, the sense of geographic space within the park, and the overall understanding the experience provided. You don't need to read classical sources, but it helps. I would recommend Plato, who articulates much of the Agora's layout in his Dialogues. It's quite possible that the space that Socrates taught \"away from the Stoa\" (and thus, the Sophists) is the little grove/train track area that run adjacent to the remains of the \"Red Stoa,\" the old home of the Stoics.The site is full of great temple ruins and a well-made replica of a stoa. Be sure to check out both floors of the reconstructed stoa; the upper-floor holds Roman copies of Greek statues and a nice three dimensional layout of the park.Outside of the stoa lies a Byzantine church, more stoa, and the ancient Gymnasium. Traversing the whole thing takes about an hour or two.  If you're interested in history, this place is a must. Wear sneakers. The days of sandal-walking are long-over 'round these parts--the ground is treacherous, especially near the main ruins. Bring a camera. I would recommend tackling the Agora in conjunction with the Parthenon. The experience dovetails nicely, and provides a full look into the center of ancient Athens.\n",

Not very steep to walk up and the. Use the opportunity to walk down the opposite side of which you accessed the site.On the way there or back you can decide to eat at the very many eateries or even just have something to drink. Owners all very friendly and fans which spray a fine water mist are very welcome. Portions of food can be very large - be warned. Well priced and great value for money.

I felt like I was walking among the ancient Greeks just being there, but that might be too subjective.

Outside along the walls are displayed statues and marble carvings and there is a museum shop and as well as WC. Inside is a small museum display of archaeological findings in the Agora. The Museum provides shelter from the harsh weather and gives a fresh resprite from the heat.Then right ahead at the end is the Chruch of Holy Apostle. Outisde the church is part of the collapsed Aquaduate. The church is well preserved restored. Inside there are murals of restored christian arts. Towards the right, on a small hill is the Temple of Hephaestus.

It is a great opportunity for photos.The site itself can get quite hot with little areas of shade in the site excluding the Stoa so be sure to have drinks and a sunhat on a hot day!Be cautious of the opening times as it closes at 15:00 at the moment which seems crazy so be warned!\n",

For some bizarre reason, the Acropolis is packed with tourists, and this place was mostly empty. Now, there’s not much left of it. But the plaques are very informative, explaining each site and showing images of what the structures once looked like. You can also listen to a Rick Steves audioguide as you walk through (it’s free), which is what I did. It really helped. There’s also a fully reconstructed building called the Stoa of Attalos. I’m sure it’s not 100 percent accurate, but it’s more than enough to give you a good sense of what the building once looked like. Inside is a very cool little museum, showing items they found at the site. You’ll even see an Ancient Greek voting machine. Also part of the site is the Temple of Hephaestus, which is likely the best preserved Ancient Greek temple anywhere. But for me, it was the smaller things. There’s the remains of a well you can see, and it still has marks of wear on it from the ropes they used to pull up water. This is where Socrates walked. It was the center of life in Ancient Athens. It’s where the huge parade went on its way up to the Acropolis. This is a must-see location. Don’t just walk up to see the Parthenon and call it a trip. Until you’ve been here, you haven’t seen Athens. But a word of warning: This, along with some other sites, closes at 3 pm for some inexplicable reason. I think it’s absurd and does a disservice to visitors, and needs to change.\n",

And by glory times we mean the era between 5th century BC (classical Greek antiquity) and 1st century AC (Roman domination). The buildings and ruins encountered in there spread from the early 5th century to even a Christian church built on 1000 AC. The whole area although in the middle of Athens is well far away from the ambient noise of the modern city and offers a serene experience to the visitor. It offers a variety of monuments of which (in my opinion) the best preserved is the temple of Hephaestus (Latin Vulcan). The Attalus Stoa (portico) is also impressive but it was rebuilt in the 1950s by the American school of archaeology. It is well situated between 2 metro stations (Monastiraki and Thesion) so it easily accessible. You have a visual to the Acropolis and can appreciate the full glory of the place. The entrance is 8 Euro for adults (30 Euros if you wish to purchase the full ticket for Acropolis and all other sites in the vicinity).

Along from the main entrance, either side of the ruins, there’s a 1 kilometre straight track/road where they used to race their chariots. It’s a really interesting and fascinating place. If you’ve got kids you can also let them off the leash as there is a vast space for them to run around but probably tell them not to jump on the thousands of stones or columns as the attendants are paranoid about you touching things you shouldn’t as I found out to my embarrassment. There’s also an excellent museum with thousands of artefacts that have been restored over the years. You can only appreciate the craftsmanship by looking at the beautiful sculptures, jewellery and practical tools and instruments used thousands of years ago. You’ll also see what they call a miniature version of the Parthenon but original and totally complete. They reckon it’s the best preserved type of its kind that exists in the world but that’s simply what was written.

      "Review text is :Agora was high up on my chart as it was one of my most wanted things to see in Athens.The Agora is on the northwest of Acropolis and was surrounded by temples, stoas and statues. The Agora was as important as the Acropolis to the Athenians in ancient time.It had been the marketplace for the Athenians since 6th BC for 1,200 years. This was the central hub for social, religious and commercial activities. Agora was also the centre of democracy as this was the place where many political decisions were made. There are lots to see in here. However, the highlights for me were:1) Temple of Hephaestus (will review it separately)2) The Odeon of Agrippa and the 3 serpent-tailed giants and Tritons on huge plinths: This musical theatre was built by the son in law of the first emperor Augustus in 15AD. It was an amphitheatre with space for around 1,000 audiences. It was destroyed by fire in 267 AD. Outside, there are still 2 Tritons and a Giant statues standing today.3) Middle Stoa: it was the largest building in Agora and was destroyed in a fire in 267 AD.4) Tholos: It was the head quarter for the executive committee from the council. The officers lived in this office during the interval period of 35 days. It was a circular building and people called it a \"beehive\". It was no longer in used since around 400 AD.5) Great Drain: Its main purpose was to i) carried the rain water from the Acropolis to the Eridanos river, ii) collected the wastage from the buildings of Agora to the Eridanos river. Later at around 4 BC,  they built the cover slabs on the West Street (outside Tholos) for the drain.6) Statue of the Emperor Hadrian. His head and one of his arms had gone missing but the rest of the body is still standing. 7) Stoa Basileios: It was built in 500 BC and it had 2 wings. It was used as a civil office and handled legal affairs concerning ancient cults. Like the rest of the Agora, it was destroyed by fire in 267 AD.Although so little of the Agora remains today, Agora is still one of the most important historic site in ancient Greece. It is as important as Acropolis. In my opinion, it is a MUST SEE if you are in Athens. Highly recommended!\n",

It holds the Agora's Museum and from the second floor, you have a great view over the Agora.3. The best for last: the Temple of Hephaestus, This amazing monument is the other monument to survive ancient times - aproximately 2.500 years old and still standing, well preserved.

Though not much to see a visit to the museum in the adjacent Stoa of Attalos gives a very good idea of place.I’ve been to Athens five times now and I’m of the opinion that tours should be more structured starting at the National Archeological Museum and from there go to the Stoa, the Agora, Hephaestion and include Pnyx and Areopagus ending with the Acropolis and a nice dinner at the Acropolis Museum restaurant at around 20:00.Probably not possible in one day but surely worthwhile!

And oh the sights! The reconstructed Stoa is one of the three prominent buildings, and houses an archaeological museum inside featuring everything from voting chips to ancient training toilets to shields won in battle. On a small hill overlooking the Agora is the Temple to Hephaestus, one of the best preserved in the world. The best thing to do is wander the site for a few hours and find as many municipal buildings as possible (the mint, prison, speaker's platform to name a few).

I believe this would have cost 8E a la carte for entry. It's is very accessible and easy to navigate. There are many markings on the property but with the few they had you can get a sense of what was on the land before. It's right by the Monastriaki train line and the area around it if you want to eat or find souvenirs. Better yet, it's a 3 min walk to the Da Vinci gelato. You can by the multi site ticket at any venue and not wait in the long lines of the acropolis. The Agora was about a 6 min walked down from Hydrain's library and worth the time we spent.

There are also toilets and water fountains in the museum.We visited in the afternoon when it was relatively busy for the Agora but still empty compared to the Acropolis.

This is THE birthplace of democracy. The ruins are in varying levels of what remains, but the layout is intact. There is also a small, but wonderful, museum with artifacts onsite. The central road through the site runs up to the Acropolis and was used for the annual parade which culminated atop to honor Athena. There is a small historical church and the ancient Temple of Haephestus (later a church) perched up on a small hill in near-perfect condition. With all that said, you can spend an hour or all day here getting lost in a centuries past and enjoying the leafy quiet in the middle of the busy Plaka tourist district.  The admission price is small (8 euros) and I would suggest either a guided tour or downloading Rick Steves' audio guide tour to your phone or ipod (free at his website) to make sense of the place and really make it come alive. Otherwise, it could just look like a pile of ruins and it is so much more. As the Ancient Agora is located at one end of the Plaka district, and the Plaka is not large in area, it is easy to wander through and end up here.  There is also a long row of restaurants running along the street outside of the entrance for lunch, dinner or snacks.\n",

Your first stop on the right is an ancient spring (used since Neolithic times) called the Klepsydra. Continue walking and you'll see a metal staircase that will lead you to three caves dedicated to Pan, Zeus and Apollo respectively. Continue on the walkway and look up to see the Mycaenean spring which could be reached in ancient times by an interior wooden and rock-carved staircase leading to the spring 40 meters below in the interior of the Acropolis. Then you'll encounter the drum of a column belonging to an older temple which evidently fell as it was being built into the north wall. If you look up there are other remnants of older monuments built into the wall. Then there is the outdoor shrine to Aphrodite. As you turn right and are on the east side of the Acropolis you'll see the cave of Aglauros, named after the daughter of one of the first kings of Athens, Kekropos. Athenian youths would give their military oath here for two years of military training. The walkway takes you south to the theater of Dionysos which seated about 17,000. Above it is the Choreographic monument of Thrasyllos which was actually in the cave (later made into a church- the Virgin Mary) of the Cave). Next to the theater is the sacred site dedicated to Asklepios, god of healing. At the end is the Odeion of Herod Atticus. There are many more things to see, I have only briefly mentioned the most striking. Enjoy!\n",

Many people only go to the Acropolis and the museum, but do find the time to visit the ancient agora and the museum of the stoa of Attalos. The agora was the place where social, religious and commercial activities were held. It was the center of the city. There's few things that has survived the years, but you get a great overview and information about the place. The temple of Hephaistos is a must see as is the museum in the stoa of Attos. It's not a big museum, but the artifacts were great!Come early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid heat and crowds...The pamphlet you get at the entrance is limited, as is the signs in the place. Read a little about the place before you go so that you may more easily understand how the city worked and thus get more out of your visit. I had my son, who knows ten times more than me about old Greece, walk me through the place and all the extra information from him helped a lot.\n",

They would go shopping, they would go to meet friends and others to socialize, they go to visit a temple or hear someone speak or whatever. There were so many things a person could and would do in the Agora! There are not too many buildings standing t oday, in fact hardly any, but there are remains of several and they bring those times back to life in a way. The Agora is just below the Acropolis and all you need to do after you purchase your ticket is just walk around at your own pace. We did walk leisurely for some time and really enjoyed the walk and everything we saw. The temple of Hephaestus stands out, as it is the best well preserved building. it is a beautiful place and well worth the few euros entry fee. You can choose to only see the Agora or you can get a combined ticket to see the Acropolis and other sites., and this is probably better if you have the time. You will be glad you did.\n",

I recommend using the Rick Steves self-guided tour - otherwise it's difficult to appreciate what you're walking through. Signs are sparse. Definitely walk over to the Temple of Hephaestus - not just for the temple itself but for the views from that high point. Also, try to find the statue of Alexander the Great.\n",

It's the best  preserved temple I saw in Greece and really gives you a feel for what the buildings were like 2500 years ago. Second is the stoa. We heard mention of shops on several tours but all we ever saw was foundation stones. But they have actually rebuilt an example of an ancient Athenian mall. It really helps you visualize the period. Within the space is a museum housing finds from the area,  Lastly there is a small Byzantine chapel which has some excellent examples of painted walls.  It's also very cool on a hot day.\n",

If you roam around the ruins and visit the ones a bit further out from the centre towards the direction of Acropolis, you will come across a place which, most likely, was a prison where Socrates died. It is marked. Artefacts in the museum of Stoa of Attalos are few but appealing; including bronze disks used by jurors to render a verdict and ostraka, with the names of politicians to be exiled. Stoa of Attalos also turned out to be the place where Treaty of Athens was signed in 2003, paving the way for EU Big Bang expansion up to 24 members in 2004, so there is something unique in each corner of the Agora.

Tickets are required to enter the grounds, but given the age of the ancient ruins (more than 2000 years old) I do not mind paying the 8 Euros.

No way, I thought, am I going to spend any time looking at old architectural bones.  However, when I unintentionally stumbled upon the site, I said \"what the heck\", purchased a ticket and entered.What fascinated me was the beauty of the statues that were created almost two millennia ago, at a time when there were no iPhones, no lasers and no mechanical tools.  Yet the sculptors of that era had better artistic sensibilities than most artists today, as well as the skills to use primitive tools to manifest these sensibilities.And I realized then and there, standing in the Agora of Ancient Greece, that we've really made a mess of the world.\n",

Amazing cocktail bars, graffiti murals and a large area to explore with people eating drinking and dancing in the street. I did not rate Athens the first two trips I made in 2015 and 2017 but when I found this place in 2020 I came back in 2021 and will keep coming back as my first and last port of call while touring the islands!Another good area unspoilt by bucket loads of tourists (yes monestraki isn’t if you go where I have said there and very few tourists) is Phillipou again great bars and street food filled with locals and local prices not acropolis rip off.\n",

      "Review text is :Most visitors to Athens, especially first-timers, may not have heard of Monastiraki. The Parthenon atop the Acropolis is iconic and everyone’s primary reference when it comes to Athens.  Perhaps they might even have known about Syntagma Square, long famous for its changing of the honor guard, more recently notorious for frequent large protests during the current economic recession.  While those 2 sites are definitely on the must-see visiting I strongly urged newcomers to explore Monastariki Square and the surrounding district of the same name. There is no question that the can be crowded with fellow tourists and locals and you could be at risk of being accosted by beggars if not actually be pickpocketed. The same could be said of any major city square popular with tourists. We visited several times in early February, prior to the COVID19 pandemic, before the imperative of social distancing and it was not too crowded.  It was also early February, the low season. We did not do any shopping as we walked past the many stalls. It is much more than the flea market and a shopping district that it is known for. The historical aspect of the square is not emphasized enough.  We checked out the Roman agora (marketplace) and walked through the Roman ruins of Hadrian’s Library.  We visited the small Greek Orthodox Church of the Pantanassa or the Dormition of the Theotokos at the north end of the wedge-shaped plaza. It is a tiny remnant of a large monastery that once occupied to entire square. Hence the term “monastiraki “ literally “small monastery”.  The church dates back to the 10th Century AD or CE and is thus over 1000 years old. As you look south from Ermou Street (the wide end of the wedge-shaped plaza) you see the Orthodox Church on your left, the Metro station in front on your right. Just across the station on your left is a many-domed structure, the Tzisdarakis Mosque. It was built in 1759 by the Ottoman Turks who ruled Greece for 400 years or so. Just south of this former mosque are the ruins of the Library of (Roman Emperor) Hadrian. Rome ruled the Greeks for about 400 years and, after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire at the hands of the Visigoths, Greece became part of the Eastern Roman Empire, better known at the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire lasted 1000 years before it fell to the Ottomans.  It was during the rule of Constantinople that Orthodox Christianity became the primary religion in Greece. Further south, towering above the many buildings on its lower slopes rises the Acropolis, topped by the iconic Parthenon, built during the 5th Century BCE, during the peak of the Athenian Empire.In this one square, therefore, you have over 2500 years of Grecian history laid out before you.We did not go shopping so cannot comment on the quality of the offerings or the prices. Definitely explore the side streets and alleys of Monastiraki and Plaka; some areas are so laidback that you almost feel like your are in a Greek village and not a major city.If you have a chance grab a table at the rooftop bar of the A-for-Athens hotel across Ermou street from Monastiraki Square (north, flat end of the wedge). Come late afternoon before sunset, place your orders, settle back and savor the scene and your drinks.\n",

During the day in the Flea market, I was pick pocketed and they stole my passport. I only discovered this loss later that evening at Athens Airport and had to return back to the city, and book a hotel and then go thru an emergency travel documents application process and only able to travel three days later. All these cost money of course and were totally unplanned.The people who stole it, had initially approached us to sell flowers, when we said no, they tried to give us the flowers as a gift, for free. We refused this too, but they persisted, and kept pushing the flowers up close to us.I now realise that the big bunch of flowers was a cover / camouflage to hide their hand and to do the pick pocketing. At the same time another in their team distracted my wife so that she could not see what was going on. So it was all planned and organised.I reported it to the \"Special\" tourist police, and they basically just wrote out a notice and handed it to me for insurance purposes. I tried to tell them / describe the suspects and they were not in the least bit bothered. They said if I wanted to do that, then I needed to wait for a further one hour and file another legal report.  So of course, I did not want to have to wait another hour. The Tourist Police also seemed bemused that why was I making such a fuss, as this was a very common occurence, and he showed me his register of the last day which had dozens of entries. His point being this is common and I should get on with it.He also said that even if the Police did anything, they would be out in a day or two and would be back to the same old tricks. That was like his justification for doing nothing. I was thinking privately, that its no wonder therefore with that attitude of the police, that there is so much of it around, as although the \"laid back\" attitude of the Greeks is generally charming, at this point it was clearly one of the problems. I even wonder as I didn't make the follow on legal report, then are these figures even making it to the official crime statistics.Since returning, on mentioning it to some friends, I found that quite a few of them also have had such problems in Athens.Hence my note of caution, do visit Athens of course, its lovely, but when visiting make sure you put valuables in something that cannot be pick pocketed and if people come up close and offer gifts such as large bunch of flowers, then remember this note and back away holding onto your valuables!\n",

Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, Jewish, Christian, Islamic and Modern. The view from Ermou Street just after the passage of the historical Bairaktaris traditional taverna and the view by the end of the famous Athinas Street just by the time one arrives at Monastiraki. The Acropolis of Athens, the most famous Classical monument, architectural wonder dedicated for Athena the protectress goddess of the city, symbol of Athenian excellence and the triumph of Civilisation over Barbarism. Down under, is the Roman Agora and the famous library of emperor Hadrian; the Roman emperor who received Greek education. Then it is the Christian monastery, from which the area got its name. Notably, as Athens was iconic in Classical and Roman times, it was a fortress for Christianity and it witnessed a rich and glorious Byzantine era. Saint Paul the Apostle, visited the city by a boat that anchored in Faliro (Piraeus now) and taught the Athenians the gospel in the first cen9tury AD. Finally, one can see through the capture the (Palio tzami) or the Old Mosque, which marks the Islamic era in Athens through the Turkish Ottoman occupation. The mosque that is not functioning was used as houses for the army then now it hosts the museum of folk art. Beside all of this, with a wider scope you can also see the modern life's shops, market place, restaurants and hotels. Moreover, another hidden gem of Athens, Greece: The riverbed of river Eridanos can be best traced in Monastiraki square (an open site in the middle of the square excavated in 2007) and an open archaeological site inside the station (rediscovered during the works for the metro 1990s).

Stop for some gyros (specifically at the place just around the corner, Savvas!!), and grab a cocktail on a rooftop patio (A for Athens) to people watch and get a good look at the Acropolis. Most of the shops sell the same stuff stall after stall. The further you walk the better the price. Some owners may negotiate prices but I felt it rude to ask unless they offered.

Once I figured out the scam, I found that these men are running the same scam in Rome, Paris and many other city centers of the world. This is a criminal scheme and these men should be arrested. If you hear “Hakuna Matata”... DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THESE MEN!!\n",

Consider , a streeet full of fabric vendors, all in one place so you can browse many different places without traveling all over town. How about stores that sell table cloths or others that sell hardware like drawer pulls and towel racks. Again,all in the same location.  There are blocks with farmers stalls selling dozens of types of olives, or whatever vegatables you might want for dinner. My favorite is the meat markets. Each area has 1 or 2 items to sell, like chicken or goat, beef and pork, etc. Another area has seafood of all types. I've never seen so many octopi, fish, squid and shrimp in competing stalls all in the same wing of the meat market. In other parts of the Monastiraki you will find spice vendors, dairy and yogurt vendors, candy stores and eggs by the dozen or one or two. What a terrific experience.\n",

If you want to dance you can do that too as some restaurants have live bands, feel free to get up and shake a leg to some traditional music. While it is wheelchair accessible it may be a bit difficult for a wheel chair to traverse the narrow streets with so many people.Getting to Monastiraki is easy as a train station with the same name is directly below, you get there on the green line.I will recommend visiting if you're in Greece, this is a must see. 5 stars experience\n",

It is lively and colorful and full of people. Every shop and eatery speaks English and the local people are all very friendly. You can get to the square by bus, metro, taxi or on foot from several of the surrounding districts.Unfortunately, being the center of tourism, Monastiraki attracts all the lowlife and there are plenty of dodgy people to look out for including beggars, pickpockets and street peddlers. Don’t let this put you off from this experience but do take great care with your belongings especially wallets, cameras and phones which can be swiped of your table. We ordered a selection of dishes at one street cafe and a passing beggars swiped one plate right off our table in front of us. I only lost 2 chicken Slovaki but if it had been my phone it would of been much different.Sunday is best day to go as they have an antique market and flea market and there’s all sorts of interesting junk to browse through and get your photograph taken next to. I would suggest going to see the changing of the guards at 1100am on a Sunday and coming straight here afterwards for browsing eating and drinking\n",

It is with a heavy heart i post this to warn other buyers of this danger.  It has spoiled my experience of Greece and Athens shopkeepers in particular.It would appear that I have been caught out with my jewellery purchase from Takis jewelery and diamonds - a father and son team.  At the start of the numerous emails after I returned to my own country, they said their bank had failed to pay me ie the instructions from them to refund my credit card had gone to their bank and it was the bank they were following up to make sure the bank paid me and said it was a problem with their bank that they have never had before.  When the money never came I kept following up.  Numerous emails later (5 months to date) they now claim they did not receive the stamped export document that i submitted at the airport (using their paperwork and envelope) and that’s why they cannot pay me.  Buyer beware!  It may well be true.  I will never know.  So! If you need to buy jewellery, to save yourself any headaches, there are shops where you can avoid having to claim the tax back at the airport as they are allowed to sell jewelery to you tax free.  and I have gotten nowhere getting my money back since leaving the country.   Note - If they refund me the money that i am entitled to i will update this post to advise you.\n",

A few steps from there is our favorite outdoor restaurant Terina.Many shops, including restaurants, coffee shops, fresh fruit stands, jewelry stores, souvenir shops and bakeries populate the area.  There are many small streets leading to the center of Monastiraki all having wonderful shops with all kinds of interesting merchandise.  The Ancient Adrianou Street runs from one end of the area to the other.  Allow plenty of time to enjoy all the traditional aspects of Monastiraki.The Metro Station is nearby for easy access to transportation.Shop owners are courteous, friendly, and accommodating with interesting stories to relate to foreign visitors.As with any tourist attraction, the area can be very crowded.  We must be vigilant about personsl possessions and handbags.  A visit to the Monastiraki is an interesting and memorable experience.\n",

The food at both these restaurants is plentiful, tasty and very reasonably priced.  The Metro entrance is located right on the square as well.  Just hope on the train and go anywhere you want to go.  Monastiraki is convenient to anywhere you wish to go.  Take the time to wander the street and enjoy the atmosphere.  It's buzzing with people and music, especially in the evening.\n",

Nothing you cannot see in many other parts of Greece. There are many places to eat and drink but they are also nothing special. Overall, its poor, and if this was in my town I wouldn't bother to go there. Overall, we found Athens to be ruined by graffiti, and wondered who, if anyone, is in charge there these days.\n",

Today the square is very crowded, expecially on Sundays, when the nearby open air flea market attracts many tourists. There are small shops with souvenirs and old tavernas with traditional greek foods. Monastiraki was the site of one of the largest monasteries in Athens. Most of this 'Great Monastery' was demolished during archaeological excavations in the nineteenth century. So little was left of the complex - only the church remains - that it was ironically named 'monastiráki' or 'little monastery', which eventually gave the neighborhood its name. The surviving church, also known as the Pantanassa Church, was built in the 17th century. At the south corner of the Monastiraki Square, bordering the Library of Hadrian stands a domed building with a triple-arched loggia. It was built in the eighteenth century, during the Ottoman occupation, by the local governor Tzistarakis as a mosque.\n",

There are spots with great views of the Acropolis and although there are lots of people, it never felt too crowded.

Now most of it is an upmarket outdoor shopping centre. The jewellery shop owners are genuinely honest people and not out to fleece the tourist as I have made many purchases there myself and pleasantly surprised at the valuation given in the uk . I'm not saying some shopkeepers sell fake goods but beware if it's to cheap there IS a reason for this . Monastiraki is a notorious pick pockets working ground so keep your bags closed and wallets not in your back pockets or in veiw . There are plenty of tavernas with traditional food and drink on offer do not drink to much alcohol in the heat keep yourself hydrated with cool bottled water and wear a hat and sunglasses and if course sun screen . Take care and have a good time be careful like most cities .\n",

We loved the hotel we we're at, a is for Athens, enjoyed the food, enjoyed the shopping, and the views, but having beggars come up to you always leaves a sour note. We also had a hard time finding a grocery store, we wanted extra water and juice which could be bought at kiosks, but we were interested in a more grocery store setting.

Be aware that there are pickpockets in the area and also avoid the North African men who approach you saying \"You are Lucky\" or \"Hakuna Matata\" and try to tie a coloured band on your wrist and then extort 5-10 Euros from you...I saw this happen to a lot of people and it just spoils your day, really. Do take a look at the Monastiraki metro station for some really cool archaeological remains.\n",

It is a place to shop or just pass the time. It does not really matter. Either way it is absolutely exciting! We stayed in a hotel in the Monastiraki area for about two weeks and loved being there. We walked through the Market every day and simply enjoyed it. We also enjoyed doing quite a bit of shopping too! Shops offer everything you can imagine for sale. Anything tourist shops sell you will find it there, and more. There are  also sellers who will sell you literally anything, including mobile phones, batteries, chargers anything, which may be new but also years old! They will sell really old stuff ranging from stamps to jewelry to furniture to whatever, they have it. However, in most cases we would be careful to just keep walking and ignore all that stuff. Of course many shops sell new wares, like clothing, jewelry, leather goods, shoes, food stuffs, like amazing Greek honey and olives, and much else. You will also find countless cafes and restaurants, particularly souvlaki places. The prices are quite cheap and you would be better off eating at one of these places rather than at others in the city. The Flea Market is named after the nearby Monastiraki Square, where you will also find the Monastiraki Metro station. It is a tourist's paradise! We certainly loved it and we are sure you will too.\n",

My partner was pressured by a young man to buy me one of his cheap bracelets.  He, unfortunately, engaged in conversation with this young man as he felt bad for him.  Once he figured out he was trying to occupy him so his friends could try to grab his wallet, he told him no and walked away.  They didn't stop the pressure.  One yelled to me, \"wait for your husband\" and kept trying to put another bracelet on my wrist.  Another traveler told us his family was involved in a scam where the woman claimed his child knocked her cup of coins down the drain where they were seated.  He told her he did not and insisted she move on.  They then watched her do it over and over while travelers would hand her money to make her go away.While you are in the area just stay aware.  Ignore the thieves, stay aware of your purse/wallet, etc. and enjoy the craziness of the area!\n",

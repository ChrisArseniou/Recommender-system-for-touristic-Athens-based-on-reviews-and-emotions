Established in 1930 by Antonis Benakis, this private collection houses some real gems from different periods of Greek history. Not only are there exquisite ancient artefacts, but there are also fascinating examples of early Christian art and lesser-known aspects of Greek culture. As you progress through the rooms, you go forward in time; there are examples of Byzantine and Ottoman art, local costumes, traditional domestic rooms, paintings of a later period... the collection is quite mind boggling. My only quibble is that the numbering of some of the rooms was rather confusing. Give yourself plenty of time to see this worthwhile collection.

It was a beautiful old building that was very comfortable to take refuge in from the blistering heat outdoors.  We particularly liked the comprehensive displays of well explained items from throughout Greek history (easy to use and access audio tour on own cell phone), great places to take pictures, and the very interesting more modern temporary exhibit featuring life works of European artist.  The clothing on display showing history of how people dressed in different places throughout Greek history to be particularly well done.\n",

You will be better equipped to appreciate the major historical sites and other remarkable museums such as the Acropolis museum. Also, the museum's peculiar charm reflects the choices and tastes of an individual collector, Antonis Benakis, rather than the more neutral and encyclopedic style of traditional museums.

Greek history and culture are vividly brought to life on each of its four floors, with a mixture of permanent and temporary collections. Not only is it proud to display the many regional differences that made up Greece through the ages, but it also pays homage to the influence of other non-Greek cultures. The displays of traditional costumes on the second floor are of a remarkably high quality, as are the preserved Ottoman era salon interiors. Fans of the V&A Museum in London should not miss the Benaki. Within a stone's throw of both the equally impressive Museum of Cycladic Art, and the Christian and Byzantine Museum, try to see all three in one day.\n",

For non-runners, entry is also free every Thursday.I was not organised enough to book on to a tour, but from what I overheard when occasionally in the same room, they seemed very interesting.  What I liked about the museum beyond other tourist attractions in Athens is that it gave a sense of Greece beyond ancient Greece. It offered glimpses into the lives of Greeks in modern history, and particularly a sense of the formation of the modern state, the creation of a modern Greek identity.It is not a very large museum, and though it is well labelled in English, I felt that I would very much have benefited from a tour to give more context to what I was looking at.But I thought the costumes, the tools, the instruments, the information on the war of independence, the paintings of Byron and Elgin, all provided a more interesting perspective on modern Athens.Plus, there are great views from the coffee shop balcony.\n",

Simply the collection is HUGE! From the first floor the jewellery, costumes, pottery, tapestry and more than I can remember just overwhelmed me beyond belief.

A silence that communicates in the most profound, polite and delicate way the most important human thoughts, meanings and ideas. Still images and photographs have this same ability to communicate in silence the most personal feelings, ideas and thoughts captured by the photographer.The photographs of Joan Leigh Fermor: Artist and Lover currently hosted at the Benaki Museum in Athens, Greece represent a romantic dialogue between two lovers and life partners, Joan and Patrick Leigh Fermor. Few images actually depict Jaon or Patrick in person, and even fewer photographs show the couple together. Despite of that, however, they are both very much ‘present’ in each and every photograph beautifully placed in this special and different exhibition. A modern exhibition and a special addition to the more permanent classical Greek heritage exhibits hosted in this important and established venue located at the heart of the capital city.The love of the two special and sensitive humans and lovers for the Greek world is clearly communicated with the meaningful silence that characterizes still images which are yet full of ‘color’ and life.A beautiful memoir of the loving wife for her lover, husband and best friend Patrick (Paddy). Patrick becomes an integral part of the ‘love message’ that Joan is sending through her photographs as well as of the stunningly beautiful Greek landscape that witnessed their exceptional love story and journey together. A journey during which the artistic couple had discovered and experienced together the Greek culture, beauty, and way of life in the most authentic way. Each photograph exhibited represents a milestone in this special love journey in which the two protagonists are seen as part of the landscape and not simply placed within a specific context. There is an admiration and a clear ‘love theme’ that transcends the geographical barriers between the different Greek cities and islands that acted as the main ‘stops’ for this English love journey in Greece and for Greece. A journey that also took place during a very rich and special time for modern Greek history.A sensitive black and white yet very 'colourful' experience that could also be complemented with a reflection on the same aesthetic experience at the beautiful museum’s roof garden at the top of the same venue with a special view!Highly recommended for good tourists, citizens and not only!\n",

I am glad that I did!The historical building itself is already worth visiting, plus all the paintings, traditional dresses and jewellery (how beautiful they are)! I spent 2.5 hours there and sadly had to leave because the last half hour was already from the kindness of the employees. So my only suggestion for fellow travellers is to go on the days that they open until midnight. Maybe a bit more planning than I did! The Terrace Cafe is also looking appealing, if I had time surely I would stop by enjoying the view with a coffee.\n",

Most of the exhibits were privately owned and donated to the museum for display.The first floor is mainly on marble sculptures and statues and artefacts from Ancient Greece. As you ventured into the museum, there’s a section on Christian and Byzantine arts and artefacts. Second floor are paintings of Athens from the 1700 and various national cum regional costumes worn by Greeks on their weddings etc. Overall it’s a miniature version of the National Archaeological Museum. However it’s display could very well rival any museum in Athens. Do spend at least 1-2 hours to justify its interesting display.\n",

There were some really intricately detailed and interesting pieces, especially in the ancient section (more our area if interest). My favourite was this amazing gold hair piece that looked as though it was fit over a lady's bun, with interwoven gold strands around the sides dating from 3rd century BC. Quite remarkable what people could do back then with the tools they had a available at the time. The cabinets and displays were named clearly and there was an English translation to everything.\n",

From the moment you walk up the elegant steps to the front porch, enter through the doors into the central hall and glimpse the stunning wood fire surround in the room to your right with its fabulous plasterwork ceiling, you might also find yourself captivated by the former home of the Benakis family - and that's before you even begin to dive into the rich and varied collection housed therein.  Fabulous ceramics from many centuries BC, exquisitely handcrafted clothing from central Macedonia, Crete and Cyprus, charming watercolors by Edward Lear (be sure to read the comments he wrote on his drawings), Lord Byron's writing desk, entire rooms from a mansion in Kozani, Macedonia - the list goes on and on. Whether you need a break or not, be sure to visit the wonderful café at the museum, if only to see the mural by Antonis Kyriakoulis with its parade of quirky characters in amongst the ruins of Athens - an utter delight!  The ground floor gift shop offers many ways to tempt you into parting with your money.  Allow a good few hours to give the Benaki the attention it deserves.  It will not disappoint.\n",

It is quite interesting to get an idea of how life was back then through these everyday objects. The special exhibition of IKARUS is also amazing. There is a lovely cafe restaurant on the second floor wth open balcony that prepares tasty food, especially the almond cake, to take a short rest in between exhibits.

Entry for adults is not the cheapest - 9 Euros per adult, but well worth it. Something for everyone - it's not all statues and pottery!  Of particular interest to me are the many different traditional costumes from many parts of Greece. After your visit, come out of the main doors onto Vasilissis Sofias Ave, head left, then turn immediately left into Koubari Street. This will lead you up to the lovely area of Kolonaki which has some interesting up-market shops and varied restaurants. Explore the area and enjoy a frappé in Kolonaki Square after your Benaki visit. 😀\n",

The use of interactive media (see photo), sitting on the chair in front of the screen, you feel that you are talking to the person in the screen. There are a number of these around the museum.  The topics discussed in these interviews/sharing sessions are about the subject person's views on Greek culture, art and/or  museums in general. I thought this is an innovative way to present and educate.You can spend 2 to 3 hours looking through each section of the museum. A good way to spend a few hours off the hot summer afternoon sun.\n",

In fact there are several Benaki Museums, as one site cannot accommodate all the exhibits. The museum on this particular site is, as mentioned, fantastic. There are several floors full of exhibits of Greek art and historical items, from the ancient Greek times right through to modern times. There are ancient Greek statues, vases, jewellery, and other objects, and other items from many areas of Greece, There are even whole rooms of wealthy houses on show, there are national costumes from different parts of Greece, there are paintings, and the list goes on. It is amazing what this museum holds. It was established in 1930 by the Benaki family, an exceptionally wealthy Greek family of influence. There are stairs and there is, I think, wheel chair access. Also there is a cafeteria and a special Exhibitions Gallery where you need a special ticket  to enter. Thankfully on the day of our visit, I think Tuesday or Thursday (sorry I cannot recall) the Museum offered free general entry, so we did not have to pay. A gift we welcomed!

It is close to the Syntagma Square – just take your way up on Vasilissis Sofias Boulevard, on the left hand side of the Parliament building as you look at it, and after a few minutes you are there. On Thursday the access is free. After your time in Museum, a very nice roof-top café offers you some moments of relax.\n",

      "Review text is :The museum, privately owned, belongs to one of the oldest Greek families who have offered some of their precious possessions, including this historical neo-classical building to the country. The museum covers in three stages, key highlights of the Greek history. Yet, its most remarkable exhibits are the ancient, classical Greece gallery with objects, marble sculptures and statuettes dating from as far back as 2.500 BC. The Cycladic pottery art is priceless as are some of the collections of eminent Greek collectors who have offered their own objects to the Museum. It is nice to organize the visit with a knowledgeable Greek guide (worth the cost even for a couple) who knows about the exhibits and may also give insight into the other parts of the museum that host Christian and folk art. The two original icons by an early El Greco for example, are stunning. The museum's hidden asset is its rooftop cafe with marvellous vistas of the House of Parliament and the National Gardens. It is open till late midnight and all its meals, high quality by some known chef, are served by courteous staff. The romantic sunset views of the Garden from the rooftop restaurant and cafe are fabulous to behold. A must see museum in Athens.\n",

In many ways it is similar in spirit to the Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad, India.We went to visit the museum for the El Grecos that we had head they housed. The museum has two El Grecos from his early period which occupy a pride of place on the First floor. However the other paintings and artifacts: the early Christian iconography, in the room are very interesting too.We did discover more. The reconstructions of two Greek Macedonian  living rooms from the late 19th/early 20th century were stunning and had us captivated. Similarly interesting were the costumes from all over the Greek world. The variety of exhibits and the presentation were quite simply very interesting.When we visited, they had conservators working in a front room, thus giving us visitors a chance to see and understand their work and interact with them. That was very neat for my son. The museum also hosts a very charming rooftop cafe with nice salads, sandwiches and desserts. Overall, the intimate and eclectic nature of the museum make it a must when you are in Athens.\n",

They are all well displayed.  While we were there a special Art Deco exhibit was on display.  It was a bit understated and a bit of a disappointment but then it added just 2 Euros to the price of the entrance ticket which was 7 Euros.  It was worth the price.

After the visual impression, the exceptional tastes of the Dipnosofistirio (Δειπνοσοφιστήριο) catering was a gastronomic experience that completed a successful social event.Order: we went for a fixed menu including some delicious traditional appetizers, 3 main dishes (meat, fish, vegetarian), a desert and continuous refill of drinks (bottled wine, beer, beverages). All of them in more than sufficient quantities and of high quality, exactly as expected by Dipnosofistirio, one of the best Greek caterings.Value for money: since Dipnosofistirio cooks there, you know that you will pay for a fancy restaurant. However, given the dishes we had and the continuous refill of drinks, 37 EUR/person was not that bad.Conclusion: Excellent option for business social events! It will definitely be among our top options for the upcoming occasions! A good option for a couple dinner, too, especially after a tour at the museum at the ground and 1st floor. I would not recommend it to groups of teens due to the formality of the venue. Also, large families might think twice to go for family dinner because of the cost.\n",

It has been thoroughly remodeled to become a museum and very well done in that regard. The first floor of the collection are items from the ancient world from a few Cycladic (Paleolithic and Neolithic) pieces and an interesting assortment from all the layers of ancient Greek culture. There is sculpture, jewelry, ceramics and more. They offer quite a good collection of jewelry and textiles across the board in all historical periods, better than some of the archeological museum's. (Including some startlingly well preserved textile pieces going back to the 5th century!) The collection is well curated and explained and well displayed. I particularly liked a small terra-cotta head of the sort spread around South Asia in the time of Alexander the Great (Marauder) which became the basis for the Gandharan school of Indian sculpture. From there we move n to Byzantine Greece with a large collection of icons from the 13th century onwards and quite a bit of ecclesiastical material. There are also paintings, books, sculpture, and more. In the floors above there are more modern collections including a very good collection of traditional costumes. Again more jewelry, household objects. On the top floor there is a lot from the 18th and 19th centuries including quite a bit of material around the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Most surprising was a wonderful small display about the participation of the poet George Gordon, Lord Byron in that war. There is a famous portrait of Byron (actually a couple) several pistols he owned, his portable writing desk and more.\n",

Another highlight were the highly ornate religious items including the whole hand carved iconostasis (a wall full of icons and wood carvings that seperates the congregation from the inner alter).  The picasso-esque cycladic art was stunning.  To see something 4500 years old and imagine how long ago that was is staggering.another favorite was the fully hand-carved wooden room.  the walls and ceiling all intricately carved.\n",

Worth an hour of your time in the afternoon after the monuments close at 3:00pm (except Parthenon), and they close promptly, if not earlier.  Tip - get up early be at the Acropolis when it opens (8:00am) then try to visit the Agora, Roman Forum, Temple of Zeus, and Hadrian's Library as early as possible (before it gets too hot). Put off lunch til later. Pick out a few museums for afternoon visits, there are 4-5 good, but not great, museums to choose from. Late afternoon or early evening visit the New Acropolis Museum (it's open til 8 and will take no more than 60-90 minutes to cover even if you like  to look at everything) and have dinner in the area. There are terrific restaurants nearby, including Liondi.\n",

I was looking at a bracelet in the form of a snake (Mycenaean collection), and I was informed that it was a snake-shaped bracelet. What is the context, what do snakes represent?  It got really bad on the top floor, which describes the War of Independence (from the Ottomans), which obviously is very Important to Greece. Powerful action-filled paintings, but what do they show? Then there were some interesting exhibits about the Treaty of Bucharest. How many visitors from the US or elsewhere know what the Treaty of Bucharest was and why it was important?You leave the museum having seen some interesting and in some cases beautiful items, but not with much enlightenment.\n",

There's also a nice cafe at the top of the museum with a great view, but the locals we saw were dressed quite well, so we felt a little embarrassed in our shorts.It's a few blocks from Syntagma, so it's very easy to reach by metro, and is a great way to follow the whole thread of Greek history in one building.

      "Review text is :There is only one museum in Athens that will give you a glimpse of Greek history and art from antiquity till the 1800's, and that is the main Benaki Museum. While the Acropolis Museum and the National Archaeological Museum  showcase the art and culture of the ancient Greeks, Benaki shows you a timeline of art and culture. The majority of the pieces exhibited in this museum are from private collections of wealthy people who have donated these treasures to the Greek government. The building itself was the private residence of Mr. Benakis. The museum is located within walking distance of Syntagma Square where the Greek Parliament is located and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier where you can see the changing of the guard. I consider this Museum a true jewel of Athens and always recommend it to friends who come to Greece. Where else would you go to see  artifacts such as the interior of an entire living room from a Greek traditional mansion, complete with intricate wood carvings, furnishings and rugs, or the famous jewelry set of Greek boats or the outfits the queen and ladies in waiting wore? We have visited this museum with friends and family members of various ages and it is always a hit with everybody!\n",

Charting the history of Greek fashion, culture and art from the Cycladic age until the 19th century the breadth of the collection is dizzying. The curation is excellent. Actually being able to take in the minutiae of detail in pieces thousands of years old is extraordinary. They also have a very interesting selection of artwork from the Christian Greek period. Fascinating to see how the depictions of religious iconography we have become used to in Western Europe changes so dramatically where East meets West. For my partner the best part of the exhibition was the traditional and wedding outfits of ordinary Greeks. To be given an insight into the reality of life, beyond Gods and romanticism was brilliant. Also worth noting, should you happen to be given an Athens Spotlight card you can use it here and get 50% off ticket price. Really worth a visit and not far from Syntagma and the Greek Parliament.\n",

I've always found it a bit boring looking at loads of very similar objects all crammed next to each other in a way that has no immediate meaning.  This probably stemmed from childhood, but it endured into middle age!  Despite having studied History, I still don't think 'O great, a museum!'.  But......the Benaki museum really is a little bit of genius.  I've been wondering why I loved the Benaki so much. The Greeks are such an emotionally well adjusted people and I'm wondering whether that manifests itself in the way they are able to honour their history in this authentic and  human way.  The Benaki achieves what many other museums don't.  It makes you care.  It makes you feel that you understand the people of Greece who lived here in the past and that you'd like to know more about them and their way of life. So....if you love Greece, and her warm hearted people, and appreciate what Greek culture has contributed to other nations,  I think you'll enjoy the Benaki The second thing I enjoyed almost as much (!)  is the sophisticated rooftop cafe, where all the glamorous Athenian ladies lunch.  It's great, the food's good and there's a lovely view of the city. It's not cheap but it's worth paying a little bit more just for the experience.  I'd say the Benaki is unmissable.\n",

Very tasty bread with two delicious dips (not sure what they were), stuffed vine leaves and Greek Pie. They were all really good.We went here via the Evangelismos metro. We completely missed the museum on the first walk down. It is on a corner opposite the National Gardens.You could also take the opportunity to visit the Kolonaki area while you're here- just go straight up the street away from the main road from the museum exit. You could also coordinate with a trip up to Lycabettus Hill to see the sunset. This is at the back of the Kolonaki area. You have to find the steps going up vertically. Just follow them all the way up to the funicular station. We saw them quite a few times but ended up not taking them and wandering around for ages.\n",

Do not pass the gift shop as they have some very nice pieces for sale.  Eclectic stock.Want an insight into Greek history, you will find it here - from antiquity right through to liberation from 400 years of Ottoman rule to the modern Greek state.  Even section on the \"katastrofi\"  (the fall of Constantinople).  Costumes, jewellery,war memorabilia, monumental paintings of various battle scenes, portraits of celebrated heroes of war of independence, photographs, memos and other texts.  Fascinating and a pleasure to see in the various rooms.Religious icons, painted in egg tempora on wood and gold leaf are just beautiful - they glow and the lighting here does them justice.   Also on view crucifixes, and other ecclesiastical  objects.The museum was set up by the Benakis family to house their enormous collection and eventually it was donated to the Greek state-and hence the Benaki Foundation set up.  Today it attracts donations from a long list of benefactors who have helped increase the collection.There are other Annexes of the Benaki museum around Athens - which I intend on visiting next timeOnce weary from seeing exhibits, head straight for the restaurant/cafe - a little pricey but there are rewards - spectacular views from the balcony to Lycabettos, the national gardens, the. Acropolis  and streets below.Watch the \"creme de Le creme\" of Greek upper class dine there - crisis has not affected them - They also have an incredible library and overheard that they run an educational program for childrenSeriously professional museum of world standard.Open every day and some evenings.Restaurant accessible without having to view exhibits - even for evening meals A must visit\n",

From exquisite ceramics and pottery, to up-scale gold jewellery of antiquity.There is a wonderful boutique/souvenir shop on the ground floor.  It is pricey, but the items available there are of exceptional beauty and quality, in my opinion, and worth every penny.  These are pieces to be treasured and handed down.There is also a wonderful cafe upstairs with the nicest waitstaff in town.  The restaurant serves very nice meals and wine for reasonable prices.

The exhibits are displayed in a manner that some of them revive in the most realistic way certain parts of its cultural history depicting the way of living in various parts of the country. What is most breathtaking though are the handicrafts related to its rich religious history, dating back centuries...Visiting the Benaki Museum is a life's experience. You may spend your whole or half of the day there, depending on your interests, and at the same time enjoy a lunch or snacks at the museum's roof garden cafe, enjoying a magnificent view of Athens.

It is based on a private collection, much augmented, and is run by a foundation. I think it's important for visitors to Greece to understand the War of Independence as well as ancient times, and this Museum has a most informative section on the foundations of the modern republic. Housed in a gracious building, the Museum is centrally located. You can easily walk there from Syntagma Square. As a classicist, I enjoyed the ancient artefacts (from pre-history, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic to the Byzantine), but I really appreciated the more modern ones: the lovely folk costumes from different islands, the embroidery, and the modern history on the top floor.  The Museum shop offers some very different wares: many are based on the Museum holdings. Coasters based on folk art, hand weaving, silver, and exquisite jewellery made from precious stones. Some really lovely sterling silver brooches that make tasteful gifts. I found the staff very helpful and pleasant. For example, I wanted to buy a silver brooch (a reproduction of an artefact from the 2nd millennium BCE)  but I particularly wanted the descriptive tag that was missing. (I knew the recipient, an emeritus professor, would really appreciate the description.) The staff searched for the tag (the last one) for 20 minutes. Because I was running out of time, I then proposed leaving my email address. They contacted me as soon as they had found the tag. Well worth the second visit to pick up the brooch. I'd advise combining a visit to this museum with the Cycladic Art Museum (same street, and a few blocks further on).\n",

When I went inside it was quite a jumble, with lots of objects shoved together. It featured old Greek costumes and loads of objects from the time of the Turkish occupation (1453-1821).When I visited again in 2015, I was surprised by the increased size of the building, the more modern methods of displaying the art, and the absence of non-Greek objects. Many of these can now be viewed in the Islamic Art branch of the Benaki located in another part of town. Walking around the museum is a more leisurely pursuit these days. There is plenty of space between the highlights. As before, the finely wrought costumes from centuries past are a definite must see. The main halls from some northern merchant's houses are also attractive.If you want to see ancient Greek art, go to the National Archaeological Museum. But for products of the last 300 years or so, the Benaki has an excellent selection that is rewarding and much recommended.\n",

Much smaller than the National Archeological Museum, with an eclectic set of items on display, ranging from stone tools from 40,000 BC to modern art. A lot of folk costumes on display. A pleasant surprise was the restaurant on the top floor, with outdoor dining under an awning and table service.  This museum is about 3 blocks from the Parliament Building and about 2 blocks from the Museum of Cycladic Art, and across the street from the National Gardens.\n",

The gift of the Benaki museum to the Greek people is one of the best examples of such benevolence.The Benaki family made their money in the Greek cotton trade in Egypt, and its extensive collections of historical artifacts have been made available to the public.Ignore the puerile comments of Marlon B.  The collection is so vast and so varied, that for a family to make it available to the public at all is an act of outstanding generosity.  (Furthermore, at present, the Foundation that looks after the Benaki museum has made it free to visit on Thursdays because of the current socio-economic climate.  Please spend at least the entrance fee in the shop, because they deserve it).The entrance to the building is deceptive.  From the outside, this appears to be a relatively small museum.  However, once inside, it is like a tardis; with five floors of golden jewellery, statues, pottery dating from roughly 600-500BC.  It also has a wide collection of Byzantine/Greek Orthodox art work, beautiful textiles, and finally an insight into the interior of Greek homes from about a hundred years ago.The Benaki Museum also has a couple of other, smaller museums apart from its main site which you need to ask about.  If you enjoy art, you MUST also go to the Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghika Art Gallery which is also in down town Athens, but which is a hidden jewel.Be prepared to be entranced.\n",

      "Review text is :The last time we  went to Athens, we just hopped a train in from the cruise ship and ended up about  4 blocks from the Benaki Museum. We tried other places but as luck would have it the Benaki was open on the day we were there, while the others were closed - so visiting it was a no brainer. And we were glad we fell into it!THe exhibits were well presented and easy to understand and gave us a good feel for Athens and Greek culture. What more could you ask for ?Yes you had to pay for it- but i never begrudge museums any fees - for putting  things in one place that i would never be able to see if i travelled for  7 months. The Benaki is housed in a mansion like affair and is compact or small if you wish , but it makes up for that in the way information is presented. It is readable and understandable. In other museums we visited around town, many of the exhibits were just put out on the floor with an identifying number  and some cryptic notes - as if we were visiting archaeologists and of course understood all the shorthand - which we didnt so we could be looking at blocks of stone or lumps of cheese - although I understand the interpretation of these museums has gotten better.The Benaki is for people who are not archaeologists- haha.It is also at one end of a lovely big park you can walk through and eventually get to one and of the Plaka.Most people would never think twice about going out of their way to visit the Benaki- it is kind of out of the way from the main action, but -- please think twice and go see it  you will enjoy it.\n",

The museum is mainly dedicated to showing the history of the region, with artifacts from the Neolithic era to the present.  If you want an overview of the history and culture, the exhibits were easy to follow and made for a pleasant morning.The other reason you want to visit is the café on the top floor.  Dining can be indoors or outside on a marble terrace.  The food is fantastic and relatively inexpensive, produced in surprisingly large portions.  I noted with interest many diners wearing badges indicating they worked in the Parliament building, so the locals are \"in the know\".  We had a wonderful lunch which could have also fed us for dinner on the outdoor terrace with beautiful views of Parliament Square to the southwest and the Parliament building and park to the south, fanned by a cool breeze.  Worth the price of admission!\n",

Starts with the oldest of the Greek artifacts 5BC, absolutely incredible how such ancient pieces were created back then and have been lovingly restored. My personal favourites were the 4 gold head wreaths in almost pristine condition. The delicate jewellery was breathtaking. Having seen most of the best worldwide in ancient greek collections this little jem caught me unawares, so hard to take in what objects and how far back, were talking neolithic,  there on display. As I said it is not a huge museum but ideal if you dont wish to walk for 4 hours at the larger ones but still see some of the best. 1st and second floors start from oldest then up in years. I found the top floors not  to my personal liking as they were more clothing , furniture and rooms set in their appropriate era but this was because I was running short on time and couldnt do it justice. Check well in advance about opening hours as I went on a day when it had earlier closing hours. I was disappointed with the museum shop, very little from the great collection on sale here and very expensive. Was a bit difficult to find as signage just past Syntagma square had you going off down the side streets. Stick to the main road from the square passing the Parliament building on your right go about 200 metres its on the left side of the street, a white building not signposted only the name on the wall. Ask a police officer as there a so many posted in this area due to the amount of embassies here. They are helpful.(If you find this review helpful please tick the box tks )\n",

      "Review text is :We had a one day stopover in Athens.  The Bernaki Museum had been recommended to us by a cultured Greek woman we had met in Paros.  The woman was right, it's a terrific museum.  A gem in fact.  It's conveniently close to Cyntagna square and it's full of interesting pieces which are very well presented.  It's a treat for anyone with an interest in culture.Many of the ancient pieces were in amazingly good condition.  It almost seemed as if Mr Bernaki had gone out of his way to select the finest and best preserved items and the care was evident in displaying these precious things.I would recommend a stop here from anywhere between two hours and half a day.   We had to try and do it in an hour and frankly it was too little time to gain a good appreciation of the collection.  We needed a minimum of two hours at least, in my opinion.  The cost of entry to the museum is seven euros.  It is a very reasonable price in my view given the wonderful quality of the collection.One final word.  The museum has a superb gift shop.  One of the best I've seen in Greece. Two gift shops in fact, one on either side of the entrance hall.  There are lots of terrific things in here.  Some very expensive, some cheap.  The running of the gift shop(s) and indeed the running of parts of the museum itself seemed to symbolise the mismanagement of the Greek economy and speak to the difficult situation the country currently finds itself in.  We arrived at 4pm.  We were not unreasonably told on arriving that the museum closed at 5pm.  I left 10 minutes prior to 5pm specifically to look in the gift shops.  One gift shop seemed to have about four staff despite if being quits small.  I received a frosty reception when I arrived in both, along the lines of \"...don't you dare think of trying to stay here and making us (the staff members) stay after 5pm...\".  It was pretty ordinary.  People arrived after me and thus closer to 5pm and they received the same reception.  The observation I'd make is about lack of management and/or staff commitment to satisfying customer needs and providing good service.  The obvious way for the establishment to run itself is to keep to the same closing hours for the museum proper but to leave a little extra time, say half an hour, for people to go to the gift shop.  It was very clear that each of the people on this day who were still in the museum at closing time were keen to buy something. The shop could have easily brought in a couple of hundred euros in those last minutes.  As it was, none were given sufficient time to properly look at the shops and the opportunity to satisfy customers while gaining commercially was lost.  The staff were more focused on closing time and their weekend.  Frankly, it just seems dumb and lazy.But, this last observation cannot detract from the museum itself.  It's wonderful.  I would highly recommend it.  You should certainly think of seeing it if you have time when you are next in Athens.\n",

The museum has its share of statues and pots but the interpretation is better although the print is a little small.  The variety was the key to the enjoyment of the place.  It provided a slice of Greek life in addition to ancient Greece.  Greece has a modern history too - and here you found it.  To me it was the best of the museums in Athens.  The building has many exhibits but is not as large as the National Archeological Museum and therefore easier to get to grips with.  It incorporates national costumes, art as well as the ancient.A relatively inexpensive museum restaurant provides pleasant food and a view out towards the Parliament and hills.Well worth a visit due to the variety.\n",

Modern, clean and intimate.Staff are very polite and helpful, and the museum is arranged very very well. All items were numbered and had explanations and the museum actually houses a wide variety of Greek art and culture.I especially found the wide array if jewelry and folkloric costume exhibits fascinating, as well as furniture, linens and household items and more. This museum has so many intricate displays it would take days to see everything fully.They had 2 fully furnished traditional living rooms rescued from an old building that was fully reconstructed inside the museum. The embellished wooden panels are just amazing to see.Upstairs on the 4th floor is a wonderful little roof top cafe where you can take a break, as well as a little gift shop on the first floor. Don't overlook this museum just because of it's size. It really is a little gem! If i ever go back to Athens, i would visit again!\n",

In some respects this works, there is a little something from every time between 6000 BC till 2000 AD (except the Islamic period which I really wanted to see). Cool? Well, not really. First, very few of the 'things' are actually great, none were amazing. Second, you get only very brief summaries of the context, printed in Time New Roman, 12 point font, somewhat faded, at the start of many of the display cases. That is it, no maps, little connection between the different descriptions, and lots of periods are summarized in a sentence. It is like a stone skipping across history and giving you enough to leave you with an incomplete and unsatisfying picture. A good idea, poorly executed, and I don't understand the high ratings at all. The other complaint: you are constantly being 'sold' stuff. Honestly, in most of the displays is also at least 1 reproduction that is inspired by stuff at the display and available in the gift shop! How tacky.\n",

Specifically there are three cups two of gold and one of silver which are simply exquisite in their simple, refined beauty and craftsmanship. One can look at these for a very long time, as well as the signet rings and tiny gold ornaments which are in the same display. Seeing these cups, one thinks perhaps that true beauty, at its utmost, is almost always in refined simplicity and every additional ornamentation, superfluous and beyond the point. Too, don't miss the Mid-18th Century Reception Room from the Ottoman times and the adjacent Room from Kozani of the same period. Looking at these, one can easily imagine the opulence at the height of the Ottoman Empire. A favorite of mine, too, is the 17thC painting by Theodoros Poulakis entitled \"In Thee Rejoiceth\" and \"The Last Judgment\" an iconographic painting reminiscent of Bosch and Breugel, rich in color and detail, fascinating to behold. This museum reminds me of a smaller Victoria and Albert in its eclecticism and richness; one could easily spend the entire day roaming around in the Benaki.  The museum building, a neo-classical mansion is also quite lovely as is the beautiful rooftop café where one can enjoy a fine lunch and the views out over the National Gardens.

You'll find some archeological stuff here, but there's better in the Archeological museum. You don't come here for this. You come for the history of Greece from ancient times to the 19th century, through everyday and artistic objects: furniture, clothing, ceramics, embroideries, carpets (although the Islamic collection has been moved to the Islamic branch of the Benaki Museum, in the centre of the city). It even has two whole rooms moved here from Hepirus, with their carved wooden walls and ceilings. It is one of those places where you do want to read the plaques or to get someone to explain to you, because it takes a whole new life that way. On the ground floor, there is a beautiful shop, but pricey. You will sigh in front of the replicas of the earrings in form of a ship in full sail. If you come to Athens, don't miss it.\n",

But to me, the appeal was all the jewelry - lots, and lots of intricate pieces made back when the inhabitants of North America were still rubbing two stones together to get fire.  (I guess I should add that this museum gives you something to think about while you are dazzled by the pretty gilded items.)  The collection here is very diverse, and contrasts - in a good way - what is seen in the New Acropolis Museum.  What that meant for our family, is that there was something for everyone.  Lots of old wedding dresses and other samples of traditional clothing for my daughter, musical instruments for my son, pottery and farm equipment for my husband, and jewelry, coins and pretty glass objects for my other daughter and I who are inexplicably drawn to the shinier things in life.  One thing it was missing (and why it doesn't get a 5 star rating) is better descriptions of the items.  Oftentimes many items were grouped under very vague titles.  Or they would have a title, but we didn't know what for/how it was used.  When visiting this museum, you move from room to room in numerical order.  It isn't just one-way, so you can go backwards if you wish.  There is a mandatory (free) bag check, and coat check is also free if you visit when it is cooler and don't want to carry around your coat.  When we were there, we were practically the only ones in the museum, and rarely saw anyone else.  Because everyone in the family had different interests, we found it worked well to have everyone move about at their own pace on each floor and then move up together.  The rooftop café is a nice respite, but I didn't feel the view was anything special.  Especially when compared to what you get from hiking up Filopappos Hill.  I would not recommend going to the museum just for the café.  But I would recommend going to the museum.\n",

Everything is on a human scale, the exhibits are of a lovely quality and almost everything is interesting.  Like most people, I suppose, I tend to get tired and impatient half way through most museums.  Not the Benaki - energy was found and bones dragged around to the very end which was as much fun as the very beginning. You walk out feeling warm towards the place and feeling sure you will return.

I have gone to the Benacki on 3 separate visits to Greece- all on scorching hot days- and the intimacy of the exhibitry sooths yet stimulates the imagination while wandering through the cool mansion rooms after a hot day walking the modern city or ancient ruins. The pottery, sculpture, jewellery and textiles tell the story of Greece from the Minoan empire through all of Greece's fascinating cultural influences. My last visit was with my 3 teenagers and each had favourite parts of the collection; all 3 'staying with it' for several hours. They appreciated walking the ruins most, but preferred the Benaki to the larger scale antiquites museums we visited. My all time favourite spaces in the Benaki are the beautiful rooms on rooms of Greek costumes and the perfectly preserved Ottaman era northern Greek rooms of carved wood. In the parts of the world I have travelled, this is one of the most stunning collections ever and a great counter point- in both scale and focus- to the Athenian National Museum of Archeolgy. Both are important collections, both are worth visiting and seeing both is important for comprehending the breadth and depth of Greek culture.\n",

What a place!, what a beauty, it has the feeling of a peaceful and sacred place and is presented to the public in a very organize and easy way to see everything. At the end we decided to have lunch at the restaurant in the terrace and that was another pleasant treat, not only the view but the delicious meal, the refreshing white wine and the friendly and professional waiters.Something to share with our friends in New York.M&A\n",

The museum is around the corner from Syntagma, on a beautiful avenue with many older mansions, and just south of Kolonaki Square.  It was well worth the 7 euro entrance fee.  It is a layer cake of Greek history, from neolithic, cycladic, minoan, mycenean, classic, beautiful gold artifacts, byzantine, and of course, interesting objects from the revolution including paintings, etc.  But the collection that most intrigued me (and what I have not seen anywhere) is the beautiful hand made ethnic costumes.  Room after room of the most beautiful outfits from different regions/time periods in Greece.  Simply stunning.  Plus a few beautiful carved wood rooms from northern Greece.  It is an easy museum to visit, and I think all ages will enjoy it.  And they have the most wonderful restaurant near the top, with a fantastic balcony that you can watch the soldiers march to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every hour for the changing of the guard.  The Museum is right across the street from the barracks.  The food was a little expensive (14 euro for a julienned zucchini salad with shrimp), but was really delicious and they served it with multi-grain break which is a treat.\n",

Real rooms rebuilt in the museum and the costumes of greek native dress, guess how they must have arrived at Ellis Island?. The jewelery was wonderful and some of the statues and heads really beautiful. If you like textiles this is the place. Really nice restaurant on the roof and over all worth the trip. Maybe the national gardens accross the street will be open, sadly it was closed due to demonstrations while we were there. We also loved the Archological Musum with really great bronzes. The boy on the hourse is amazeing. Nice little cafe in the basement and also dont miss the tortese in the garden. In both these museum there is more than enough to satisy a teenager and we got some wonderful photos in the second one with lots of natural light. We did this one first thing in the morning and it wasn't too crowded, had a snack in front of it before we did the long tour.

The first floor is ancient artifacts and art, such as pottery and jewelry. The second and third floors are costumes, clothing, and furniture (including two reconstructed wood paneled rooms that are gorgeous) from recent centuries. It's a nice museum if this is your niche, but I would not suggest it for children. There is no audioguide, but there are descriptions under almost every artifact in English.

Actually one of the first things you see is the “Gold Mask of Agamemnon” and other findings from the graves at Mycenae that were uncovered. I hope to visit the Mycenae site next week so this gave some great background.Afterwards it was mainly the sculptures I enjoyed but I did also particularly enjoy the Egyptian section.

      "Review text is :It is difficult to decide which is better the Archaeological Museum or the new Acropolis Museum? These museums complement each other. If you like the Athenians believe that Athens is the center of Greece and the world, then you should go to the Acropolis Museum. If you think that Athens is the first among equals, then you should go to the Archaeological Museum. You can visit this Museum twice or three times. I visited it for the first time in 2011. This Museum was founded in 1829 immediately after the Declaration of independence of Greece from the Ottoman Empire. The Greeks restored their national identity after 4 centuries of occupation through archaeology. Why not? if you have such a culture behind you? The collection of finds here is outstanding. A ticket in summer costs 12 euros, 2 times more than in winter. Well, not 3 or 5 times. From the outside, the Museum is not shocking. Conventional building. The collection is displayed in chronological order. This is logical. The most valuable part is in hall 4, where the finds of Heinrich Schliemann in Mycenae are displayed. The main hit here is the mask of Agamemnon. In fact, it belongs to the king 200-300 years before the Trojan war, but the name given by Schliemann has been preserved. This is the original, a copy is kept in the Museum in Mycenae, where we went the next day. This is not the only masterpiece from Mycenae here. A silver wine vessel (rhyton) in the form of a bull's head with Golden horns shows what level the applied art of the Greeks reached long before the so-called \"Golden age\" of Phidias and company. If you were a little interested in ancient Greece, then in hall 15 you will find a sense of deja vu, when you remember what you saw in textbooks and books on Greek mythology. The famous bronze sculpture of Poseidon throwing a Trident is extremely emotional. Another exceptionally expressive sculpture is waiting for you in hall 21. the Bronze boy jockey is \"captured\" by an unknown sculptor at the moment of the highest tension. Like Poseidon this sculpture was found at the bottom of Artemisionus Bay and dates back to the second century BC This means that we are already in Hellenism. The sculpture of a Young man from Antikythera is named after the island near which this sculpture was found in 1900. The young man had previously held a spherical object in his outstretched right hand. It is assumed that this is either Perseus with the head of a Gorgon or Paris, offering the Apple of discord to Aphrodite. The Antikythera mechanism found there is an analog computer designed to calculate the movement of celestial bodies. Hall 30 demonstrates the ancient practice of harrasment. The sculpture of the God Pan, soliciting a naked Aphrodite, shows the vulnerability of an ancient woman. Aphrodite can't rely on American justice and the \"Me too\"movement. She has only Shoe in her hand to defend. And finally the last. Tourists used to think that since the collection is called the national archaeological Museum, it is only about Greece. Not at all. The Museum has an interesting Egyptian collection. If You still have the strength for it...\n",

The Mycenaean collection and The Cycladic Collection is world class. You then enter room after room of Greek/Roman Statuary.The Egyptian Wing was closed when I visited.The biggest problem/outright lie was the temporary display of Antiquities and the Greek war of Independence. Took up a couple of rooms tho it concerned very little about the war and spent the whole of the exhibit moaning about The Elgin Marbles being in England. Lying they were stolen. The facts are The Earl of Elgin realised that if they remained in situ, at the Parthenon they would be destroyed. The Parthenon had even been used as an ammunition store. At that time The Greeks were not interested in conservation of their monuments..Elgin bought the Marbles off the Greek Rulers legally. They were not stolen in any way shape or form..I look forward to The National Archaeological Museum returning all the Egyptian artefacts to Egypt!!!!!!Get your Museum up to order first.. The flow of the museum could be better and more informational maps should be provided. Nothing to keep children amused.. Must be the only National museum in the world not to have Audio Guides..A lot to be improved on. Not a must see...\n",

The staff spoke very good English and were very knowledgeable on the displays.an outstanding aspect was the well-presented graphical time line display which formed the basis of the artefacts visible from Neolithic times (c.6000 BCE). Sadly for us, the Neothilitic room was closed for \"technical reasons. However, the skill of archeologists in sifting through and spreading light on the development of humanity once the basics of food, clothing and dwelling were available is greatly evidenced. There are many breath-taking examples of clay-based food storage and cooking utensils, some of which are exquisitely decorated. The human need to show off wealth and high social standing is evident in the early bronze and gold \"trinkets?\"The afore-mentioned timeline display and layout of the museum pulls all this together in the different rooms.A most significant display is the cabinet containing examples of the Linear B script including the smile-inducing lined pages as seen in school \"exercise books\"Two and a half hours were enough for us before retreating to the shop and cafe set partly in a lovely courtyard.\n",

The incredible collections in my opinion are two:1) The \"Countless Aspects of Beauty\" ExhibitionAn exquisite collection, presenting perceptions of beauty, depicted in ancient statues, daily objects, and paintings on vessels. There are even samples of ancient perfumes. The exhibition really envelops you in another world, full of joy, elegance, music, and great aromas. I returned back to the hall two more times, as the experience was simply beyond everything I associate with an typical museum.2) The collection of jewelry and vases on the second floorA vast collection of gold jewels and an even bigger collection of vessels.There is an entire hall with objects from Ancient Egypt, a lot of statues, and much more. Definitely pay a visit!\n",

It’s located in central Athens, and is an impressive building in itself, not to mention the treasures housed within. You need at least several hours to feast your eyes and immerse yourself in ancient Greece. So have a stout breakfast and start early to get ahead of the crowds. By the time you’re hungry, head over to a wonderful little restaurant within walking distance called Saligaros (snails). Try the ancient Greek salad (not what you would expect but fabulous), warm lemony mashed fava beans with capers (perfect to dip the pita bread in), and the smoked pork. It’s a Cretin restaurant so you’ll be comped an iced raki to finish the meal. Sit at the sidewalk table if possible.\n",

Although quite fascinating, the gold masks and decorative items of the Mycenaean era (1600-1200 BC) really took my breath away. Having examined these wonderful exhibits in the central rooms of the ground floor, I then applied myself to the statuary, starting with the typically stiff Archaic 'kouroi' and 'korai' (naked men and modestly clothed women). These gradually gave way to more naturalistic statues such as the astonishingly realistic Artemision Bronze. At the far end of the ground floor were beautiful, yet heart-rending funeral steles: carved depictions of deceased people bidding farewell to their loved ones, which would have been placed over graves. Also on display in this area was the Artemision Jockey: a bronze statue of a young jockey astride a galloping horse. The rest of the statuary, displayed on the other side of the museum, was incredibly realistic; this collection comprised Greek originals and Roman copies. There are more rooms upstairs, where you can see wall paintings and artefacts discovered in the ancient settlement of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini. Also there are a collection of Greek vases and a gallery containing Egyptian artefacts.  At the end of my tour, I staggered out and had a meal in the restaurant in the grounds of the museum. The food on offer was European rather than Greek, it was a little expensive and the service was rather slow. However, when you're exhausted, anything will do!Undoubtedly Greece's most important museum; highly recommended.\n",

As an avid lover of ancient history it was spellbinding to view such artistic masterpieces as Agamemnon’s Death Mask, the Boxing Fresco from Tiryns not to mention the beauty of the Statue of Poseidon (or Zeus- to be determined) or the magnificence of The bronze statue of Pan riding a horse at speed. The Mycenaean section is simply breathtaking with gold artefacts from Grave Circle A and B. The statues on display are beautiful. The layout of the museum gives you a historical journey from the Cycladic period through to the time of Trajan. Upstairs the galleries of pots on the first floor are spectacular and again give you an artistic time travel experience. Some tips to make your experience more enjoyable; get there early. We got there at opening time of 8am. It took us about 4 hours to do the whole museum. By the time we left you could hardly move and certainly no chance of getting good photos without people dominating your photos. No queues and you have about 2 hours without hardly anyone around you. Tip 2- the museum shop is worth a visit and the cafe was welcome after 4 hours of walking.\n",

The museum is large enough to make it worth the visit, yet it's not overwhelming. The museum cafe was mediocre, so I wouldn't recommend planning a meal here. One caveat...the museum is flanked by some rough neighborhoods. We walked to the museum from our hotel, which was near the Acropolis, and passed though a super sketchy neighborhood (Omonoia). After we left the museum, we walked in a different direction though yet another sketchy area called Exarcheia (described in guidebooks as \"bohemian\" but in reality it's kind of scary, to be honest). We live in New York City and are intrepid travelers, so we're not usually scared. I'd recommend taking a taxi and if you do find yourself walking through these neighborhoods, hide you map, walk with purpose, and keep a close eye on your backpack/bag/wallet. The neighborhood aside, the museum is fantastic.\n",

We loved both the standing collections and the revolving exhibits, which are very creative and inspiring.  You will need at least two hours here, and preferably maybe four.  There is a nice place to eat or snack around a beautiful garden downstairs.  Surprising that this magnificent museum does not have an App -- I understand that plans are underway for that, which will be very welcome.  Another hint:  Hail a taxi on the street as you leave or use the taxi app; we found the two taxis sitting at the entrance at closing time were hucksters ready to charge four times what it should have cost to get home.

Seeing this, I was not expecting too much.  Once you get inside, WOW!  There is soooo much stuff here and well organized, and the admission pretty inexpensive, about 10 Euros.  We got there just before 4pm and we thought perhaps they were closing for the night, given the sign next to the door gave it's closing hour as 4pm.  But we were very lucky!  It was the first day of the new closing hour and we wandered inside for about 3 hours.  And we didn't see everything.  There is a small cafe downstairs with a nice courtyard to site and enjoy.

When we were there the gift shop was under renovations, so that was a bummer.

There is no written guide, no headsets for a self guided tour - only a photocopied piece of paper that lists the type of artifact found in each room, for example “sculpture.” I arrived at 5:30 (closes at 8) and was told at the information desk that there were no tour guides available...will anyone be available later? Answer: “there’s no one here now.” When I entered there was a tour guide at the very first exhibit with 2 unrelated people in her group. I’m pretty sure she would have been fine with me joining her but that wasn’t offered. At 7:40 every attendant started telling me the museum was closed and that I should leave. When I said there was 20 minutes left I got eye rolling and annoyed stares. Finally at 7:50 one attendant stated to follow me jabbering about how long it takes to close a museum. At 7:50 gift shop locked and lights out. So yes the items are beautiful, but unless you know a lot going in it’s difficult to take away anything meaningful. If you want a guide be sure to book one in advance. Plan to leave at 7:30 because the staff surely does not want to be there after that.\n",

      "Review text is :This is where most of what remains of ancient Greek treasures is on display, right from the Cycladic era to the Roman era. The entry fee is very reasonable and it’s quite a well-organised display, with a few confusing turns here and there. It takes about 2-3 hours to make a quick round of everything on display, if one proceeds without stopping at each and every piece. It is esp interesting if one has visited the sites from where the treasures have been transferred. I have been there on all my three proper visits to Athens and each time I’ve discovered something new and beautiful to behold. This time there also was a lovely exhibition on ‘beauty’ that I thoroughly enjoyed.The museum canteen is again a fairly decent place to satisfy immediate hunger pangs and there’s a restaurant outside the museum itself, but inside the complex. The museum shop could be much better in terms of variety of souvenirs. Overall, it’s a must-visit place for any tourist to Greece and should be planned for despite its slight distance away from the touristic hub of the Acropolis and Plaka.\n",

Things we noted about the museum: (1) definitely download Rick Steve’s Audio tour. It helps explain the key museum pieces! Map they give u is useless. (2) if you have a student ID make sure it has your date of birth or else they may not give u the discount (3) ticket sales office lady was rude referring to my daughter as “the girl” (4) internal museum monitoring staff is rude & unhelpful. The only thing they told us was not to make poses with that statues. Just stand straight! Excuse us! (5) front of museum needs some TLC. Shameful to see the weeds & disrepair of something that represents the greatness of Greece. (6) some beautiful pieces in the museum & a lot to learn on Greek history.

After visiting, I prefer this set up as it would take weeks of travel to view even fewer artifacts than this. Like another reviewer, I found staff to be less friendly than most Greeks, who are eager to insure visitors enjoy their incredible country. We two history nerds spent over six hours here, although two hours seems to be about average. That included a break in the cafe for water and fresh orange juice.Later that day we did the Acropolis Museum, open till 8:00 that day, with diminished attention spans.Transportation: We stayed at the wonderful and wonderfully affordable Acropolis view which is within walking distance of all we wanted to see except this museum. Local buses are an option, as well, I believe, hop on buses. With limited time and arthritic knees, we opted for a taxi from our hotel for preset fee of €10. Taxis wait in front of the museum, waiting to scam tourists and we took the bait. The first driver offered €30, saying rush hour fares go into effect at 2:30 PM. (!!!???) As we walked away another driver offered €15 which we accepted. On our secondvisit,  yes, once was not enough, we again paid a pre set €10. As we were leaving the museum a taxi was dropping off a family of tourists. The driver was a delightful (as most Greeks are) young man who charged €6.50, expressing disgust with his conniving colleagues.  We learned too late to follow Rick Steves' advice and insist on metered fare, and checking to make sure the meter is set at zero at the beginning. (We'd gotten in the habit of settling on a pre determined fee in Prague, the safest option in that other fabulous city.)The museum cafe is located downstairs in a collonaded courtyard which is one of my favorite spots in Athens, with ancient sculptures and a garden boasting aged olive trees. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is a bargain.We visited two other archeology museums in Athens, both attached to sites included with the Archeological Sites Combination Ticket. (Not to be confused with the city pass.) The Ancient Agora and Kerimeikos Museums are excellent.\n",

If you step into the basement cafeteria area (the bathrooms are next to it), you will be asked to show your ticket to re-enter.—the “basement” area is actually in an open air atrium filled with plants and additional sculptures.

Statuary and stelae from Athens' golden age are on display, as are a few rare bronze artifacts including the horse and jockey and Poseidon.  In an area dedicated to the goddess Athena, the chryselephantine statue of Athena from Roman times that was copy of Phideas' original 40 foot version that stood in the Naos of the Parthenon and is long since gone with no other visual record is on display as well.  (I expected her to be bigger.)  Leaving the museum, my friend approached a cab that was parked outside for what should have been a 10E ride back to our hotel near the acropolis, and we were taken for 49.50E, which is more than a ride from the airport to our hotel would cost.

The one downside is that the museum has terrible navigation through the collections.

So glad we went.The only niggle is that they have some strange arbitrary ruling about bags - we were halfway around the museum and one of the staff demanded I check in my small canvas bag.  Apparently, despite it being worn on my shoulder, they decided it was a backpack and they don't allow backpacks.  Whilst this conversation was taking place, at least 6 people with backpacks wandered past.  Apparently the rule is there (if they choose to implement it)  because - and I quote - backpacks can bring down statues... I fail to see how a canvas bag worn over the shoulder can topple a statue that weight several tonnes.  The smaller statues were on huge plinths above my head so I would have needed a ladder to try and knock one of them over!!It is only a small niggle, but if you want to avoid an argument, or having to carry around wallet, keys, camera, guide books, phone etc in your hands, don't take anything that staff may decide is a backpack!!\n",

No personnel were immediately present, so I took down the rope and went in. Then an attendant came over to tell me that the room was closed and I had to leave. She went away, and undaunted—I did it again. She came back, and I asked her again why it was closed. No clear answer—so off she went to bring another staff member. He brought yet a third person. Finally, he agreed to open the room for me for 5 minutes. So three staff members to keep me out, and then to finally admit me (and some new friends who got a charge out of the whole thing) for 5 minutes—then to rope it off again—instead of simply leaving it open.Then, continuing my circuit, I reached the entrance lobby and crossed it. I needed to show my ticket again. There are 3 entry points from the lobby, with three staff who must check tickets.

Some parts of the museum were quirky or outdated.

I would absolutely leaving at least 2 hours to visit the whole thing, as I barely managed to get round everything open during that timeframe. Of course, the museum is a must see for anyone interested in ancient Greece.However, there are a few oddities I encountered on my visit. The entrance hall has three different pathways leading from it, and they do intersect occasionally, but there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it, and you have to return to it often to access the other parts of the museum. In addition, you have to show your ticket each time you leave the entrance hall to enter a new part of the museum, so keep it on you.I don't know if this is a winter thing, but the museum closed at 4pm, but again, vaious parts were shut off early, seemingly randomly, and due to the labyrinthine nature of the museum, it can be quite disorientating with the various random closures and constant returning to the entrance. This is further exacerbated by the fact that there are a huge amount of similar looking Korai, so it can be quite hard to navigate.Furthermore, there are a couple of side exhibits that are great, but like everything else, they seem to close randomly. To top it all off, some sections of the museum were closed entirely for unexplained reasons. (The vase collection, the hadrian room and some other sculpture rooms)Absolutely worth visiting, just be prepared for a bit of chaos and keep a map on you!\n",

We had to find things to do indoors and I am glad we decided to visit this museum. The collection is amazing and the building quite magnificent. We were there, unfortunately, during the weekend in September when museums are free in Europe. Bad planning on our part. The staff was grouchy. The coat check man was really unpleasant and the museum was not handing out any floor maps or guides of any kind. Side galleries were cordoned off so we don't know what we missed there.Mapless, we meandered around as well as we could. There are some absolutely amazing artifacts here - the Jockey of Artemision, the Antikythera mechanism, Poseidon of Melos, the Artemesion bronze and so much more. We had some difficulty finding the Antikythera Mechanism since the staff member posted in the room spoke no English and got very annoyed with us. We ended up having to look up the location on our cellphones. There are a lot of grave steles and fascinating artifacts including those from Mycenae (Mask of Agamemmnon, Nestor's cup) and a very little bit from the Minoan Civilization. The bathrooms are down stairs and next to an absolutely lovely internal courtyard filled with artifacts and a little cafe. Had it not been a cloudy, rainy day it would have been the perfect place to have a quiet cup of coffee and just soak in the atmosphere.Definitely worth visiting if you have the time. There is a bus stop on the street outside the museum. Uber gave us a lot of grief getting a ride there with one uber unable to find us and cancelling the ride.

Pick a day when the weather is not ideal for outside touring (hot, windy, rainy etc.) to get the most out of your visit. The museum is air conditioned, and has some seating around the exhibits. I originally allocated 3 hours but ended up spending 5 hours and finally left because of mental and physical exhaustion. Even a visit to the nice cafe and  resting area on the lower floor in the garden couldn't rejuvenate me after several hours. Tips: Go early to avoid the tour groups. Be sure to stop by the information desk for a small paper map, I wish I had done that at the BEGINNING of my visit. I used Rick Steves 1 hour Audioguide to this museum (search Podcasts on iTunes) to tour the highlights of the ground floor, but the podcast didn't cover many of the interior rooms or the first floor. Some of  the skipped exhibitions were very fascinating (including the Egyptian Collection and Akrotiri frescoes on the upper floor).

The one at the museum in Epidavros is a copy with full restoration while that at the National Museum is the original and is only partially restored, but still much more impressive for a member of the medical profession. So many other fantastic pieces are on display there it would take a whole book to describe just the most well known ones. suffice it to say that the National Museum is overwhelming with it's vast collection and interpretive signs and displays. Rooms full of statuary, friezes, bronzes, coins and much, much more. Highlights include the mask of Agamemnon, the young jockey, bronze poseidon and original pieces of ancient wall painting. Jewelry, gold cups, seals and pottery abound. Allow at least half a day if you are at all interested in Greek Antiquity .\n",

We walked there and it was fine, but if you're skittish about marginal neighborhoods, you may want to take a taxi.My best tip for seeing this place is to download the Rick Steves Audio Europe app and his audio tour of this museum. His audio tour takes you to all of the important pieces and explains them very well. It's like having a private guide right on your phone. We found it very helpful for many places we have visited, but especially for seeing this museum!Some of my favorite objects were the many pieces of the beautiful ancient gold jewelry, the Mask of Agamemnon, the poignant cemetery steelies, and the frescos from the ancient Minoan site of Akrotiri in Thera (Santorini) on the top floor. We had already been to Santorini and had visited Akrotiri, so this was very meaningful to me.\n",

I entered the place, and I was observing the statues, reading the information, when, all of a sudden, I started feeling the security eyes on me. I thought that I was just being paranoid, so I didn't give a second thought to this feeling, I continued to another part of the Museum. There, I felt the same, but I continued walking (what else could I do ?). Then, when I was approaching another chamber, I saw, with my own eyes, the girl working there as \"security\" (?) making a gesture to another \"security-worker\" in the continued chamber. She touch her eyes like saying \"watch\", and did a round with her hand around her face, like saying \"open your eyes and watch for him\". This time it was for real, not some feeling of mine. It made me feel very unwelcome. Now, I understand that maybe they have some parameters about the \"dangerous-guys\", but, don't you think it is a bit too much ? I mean, I would not go with the camera in hand, pay the ticket to enter (10 Euro, not really cheap ...), just to look around  and make trouble.

You can hop off, explore and hop right back on later. The museum is closed on Mondays until 1300. Admission is E10 for adults and there are lots of great exhibits including the famous gold 'Mask of Agamemnon' and the Goblet of Nestor. We spent several hours then felt like some refreshment so went downstairs to the cafeteria. First problem, there are no loo seats in the toilets just the plain ceramic bowl, so I wouldn't recommend them unless you're desperate. Secondly, there are pigeons everywhere and they wander in and out of the cafe looking for food the whole time. Ragged looking things. I'd definitely go back to the museum - but give the cafe a wide berth!\n",

After about 10', you are walking in 'shadier' but nonetheless safe areas, and arrival to this building (total about 25' walk) is like arrival to the oasis. For a mere 10 euros, get ready to see an impressive collection. The chart at the start is worth staring at for a few minutes so that you can keep the periods straight (ie neolithic, bronze age, etc..). There was also an awesome exhibit on 'the countless aspects of beauty', which included samples of perfumes to see and smell from those times. My favorite was the huge statue of Poseidon, the one that was found in the ocean and described in the Imax Greece movie. The only thing is that I found getting around the museum somewhat confusing, I wish that there were arrows and a bit more direction, as I kept retracing my steps. A little pamphlet with directions would go a long way. Also, for some reason, at 3pm, a section was closed off. These kind of changes need to be communicated in advance.I agree with another reviewer that the cafe is a worthwhile stop; it is located in the garden area and has all kinds of delicious snacks.\n",

It is really big, so if you visit it without a guide, in order to wonder around all rooms you will need about 4-5 hours! Their is also a nice cafe on the museum, where you can stop for a while, recharge your batteries and continue! It will be better if you can afford it, to hire a tourist guide even for an hour, to show you the highlights! Do not miss the amazing and complicated “mechanism of Antikithira” the most ancient computer in the world!!!\n",

You can really get a feel for the evolution of Greek art from highly stylized and simplified sculptures to highly realistic marble statues and cast bronze works like the statue of the horse and boy that acts as a centerpiece to the collection.The downside is the behaviour of the staff. There are a number of 1 star reviews that seem to be the result of poor staff behaviour and unfortunately, it seems to be a real problem.My sons are huge fans of Greek myths as a result Percy Jackson and this was a great chance to get him excited about art and culture.When I took a photo of him doing a thumbs up sign in front of a statue, one of the staff accosted me and demanded to look through my photos. Confused, I showed her the last picture I took and she insisted I delete it. I initially refused because of how invasive and inappropriate that request is. She threatened to call security so I did delete the photo. For my part, I admit that out of shear shock and disbelief, I said her behaviour was silly.Later, in our visit, we were confronted by the same woman accompanied by an armed guard. She demanded to go through my camera. At this point, my son was really quite afraid and was trying to negotiate leaving the museum, suggesting that I give her my camera. He was afraid I would be arrested or hurt by the museum staff.Fortunately, a more senior member of staff intervened. We were lectured about following the rules but we were allowed to keep our family photos.Later, my son was yelled at extremely aggressively for touching the glass protecting an exhibit. Obviously, there are reasons not to touch the glass, but there's not need to shout and bully. It wasn't isolated behaviour, the staff are generally unwelcoming and aggressive, particularly towards children.So in short, go and enjoy the art but be careful, particularly if going with children not to show any enthusiasm for the art or culture, or you my be accosted by armed guards and threatened.\n",

In addition to many pieces from Classical, Hellenistic and Roman Greece, it also displays some of the best Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean antiquities. So, if your time in Greece is limited you can learn a lot about the long span of Ancient Greek history, art, and architecture by visiting this one museum. If you are visiting archeological sites related to these other time periods (Mycenae, Knossos, etc.), it will certainly enhance your experiences at those sites.A few tips:*If you use the Rick Steve's free audioguide (which is a good one), be sure to still see the Antikythera Mechanism in the Bronze Hall. It isn't included in the guide.*They start closing the outer halls early, so be sure to see your top priorities at least 30 minutes before closing.*Go during the heat of the day and stay cool with the air-conditioning.*If you are pressed for time and have to choose between this and the Museum of the Acropolis, I recommend coming here. You will get a much more thorough exposure to the broad sweep of Ancient Greek history. They are both excellent, so hopefully you don't have to choose!*Bring your camera, photography is allowed.Χαίρομαι!\n",

I was blown away by the Cycladic art all the bits were remarkable. Then there was the athenian bronzes the young jockey on horse, zeus (I don't reckon its Poseidon) throwing a lightning bolt and the Antikitersky youth were amazing. This is so much better than the acropolis museum. There were 2 things that let it down for me the first was being told off for pulling a face when my wife took my photo next to a statue \"no funny photos just serious ones\" and the second when we went to the gift shop there was a full size copy of the Antikitersky youth for sale and it said it was bronze with cost of €2800. We asked for more info and were told for that price you got a plaster copy (a bronze replica had to be ordered at a cost of between €15 -20k). We asked about the shipping costs and they said they don't ship, that would be up to us. I asked how much it weighed and was told they didn't know. Not much help really.

One piece of advice, standing near the statues  ( and posing in a similar fashion ) as the statues ---- is very frowned upon and you will be told that you not permitted to take the photo.

Easy to get lost, but it is big enough so that you can find a relatively quiet spot, maybe not in front of one of the must-see objects, but nonetheless something that has a cultural significance.  Important to have a guidebook so that you don't miss one of those must-sees, but allocate enough time so that you can get lost, so that you can spend more time than you expected in front of something that was not highlighted, and so that you don't feel rushed.  So, add perhaps an extra hour to your initially planned duration.  This museum is definitely worth the extra time and effort.   Incredibly rich collection.\n",

Other huge highlights were the Artemision Bronze sculpture and the Jockey of Artemision. The only regret that I have about this place is that we somehow managed to miss seeing the Antikythera mechanism. We walked into every single room on all floors, and missed it, but didn't realize it was there until after we had left and the museum was closed. Don't make the same mistake. Be aware that the Acropolis combo pass does not cover entry to this museum. We were told that it did, and then had a surprise at the door. It was well worth the 10-12 extra euro though.

      "Review text is :The art is amazing. It’s world-class, and like everything else in Greece, it’s all very well labeled and laid out. You’ll progress through time as you stroll through, and there’s informative plaques in every room and next to each item, explaining what you’re looking at. That being said, the building itself is a little run down, especially compared to the new Acropolis Museum. It’s sad, because the prices at these museums are low. I mean, insultingly low. The Acropolis Museum charges five euros to get in, and they could easily charge 30. Why the Greek government doesn’t charge more for admission to their sites and use the money to fix up this place is beyond me. It was also quite warm inside. I’m guessing maybe they’re trying to be conscious of their power bill — I have no idea. But my main complaint here was the kids. So. Many. Kids. I guess I happened to go on a day when a lot of schools take field trips to the museum, but it was absolutely overrun. Look, I think it’s great for kids in Greece to learn all about the amazing art and culture of their country — but they shouldn’t all be coming at once. I couldn’t go in a single room without there being dozens of kids. And they were LOUD. I get it, they’re kids. Kids can be loud. But their teachers seemed to have very little interest in controlling them, and the staff didn’t seem interested in stepping in. There was yelling, screaming, shouting and shoving happening everywhere. I don’t want to dissuade anyone from going. You really must go, or your visit to Athens will be incomplete. But on the off chance that anyone running the museum is reading this — do something about the kids. Limit the number of school groups allowed at one time, or tell the teachers they need to keep them under control or they’ll be asked to leave.It makes it difficult to appreciate what this museum has to offer when there’s children shrieking and putting each other in headlocks next to the ancient statues.\n",

In each gallery you are presented with an overwhelming number of displays to work your way through, most with very limited and dry descriptions. There are information panels on the walls, but again these tend to be dry. They need to inject some life into their collection - use the displays to tell stories and engage people with what they are seeing.

Coupled with the impressive collection, you could easily spend all day here absorbed in Greek history and culture. I found myself sucked into the section on vases throughout the ages, following the evolving styles and techniques used by the peoples in each era. We had our 3-year-old with us, and he did surprisingly well, all things considered, but I'd strongly suggest coming without young kids if at all possible. Any time we go to a museum with him we feel rushed, and this one contains so much that you want to take your time. It did make me wish that many of these artifacts were displayed at the particular site they were from to give them more context, but I'm glad they're available to the public either way.*if you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews love to get them and it motivates us to do more :) *\n",

There are so many sculptures and other artefacts but the signs give little context and are not exactly reader-friendly (huge blocks of poorly translated texts).We were also continously lost, as there are no signs or \"path\" through the museum - many rooms are dead ends and it's easy to miss bits. Some rooms and sections were also (seemingly randomly) shut off for visitors when we visited. Even the map of the museum existed in several different versions, making it even harder to navigate.The entrance is a chaotic mess of different desks and entrances (not clear where to go, which items need to be checked into a cloak room, which door to go through, etc).Downstairs are some toilets that have seen better days (lack toilet seats to begin with..). The museum shop was closed when we visited.The café has a cosy courtyard but pretty bad selection of items, many of which were sold out. A small cappuccino will set you back a whopping €3.50.The entrance fee in winter is €5 which is ok. I'm not sure how much a guided tour costs, but I'd say it's probably worth the investment since you won't get much out of the history or context otherwise.\n",

Also the antikythera mechanism which was fascinating and highlighted as the \"first computer\".  We had to ask where it was as it is in a few rooms off the main concourses...wtih some modern re-recreations of the mechanism it shows the incredible deductions that can be made from seemingly fee clues as we thought the original showed few clues (novices that we are!!).The bronze statues in the rest of the museum were particularly striking.  We noted that most (all?) of them seemed to be recovered from the sea, presumably preventing them being melted down and helping preservation?The cafe is in the basement which seemed an uninspiring location after the Acropolis Museum's terrace, but there is a truly lovely sheltered garden there.\n",

So, if you are going to take pictures, and also take the time to read the history behind all the items that are kept here, be prepared to spend a good 2 to 4 hours. And if you are using your smartphone to take the pictures, bring along a high capacity portable charger, because your mobile battery will run down fast due to all the pictures you are taking. The museum is within walking distance of the Victoria metro stop (M1 - the Green line). If you take the metro from Monastiraki, you will only be two stops away from Victoria station. Then simply walk about 10 - 15 minutes to get to the museum. Whatever you do during your visit, if it is your first time in Athens, do not miss a trip to this great source of knowledge.\n",

Our kids were just bored: the only 2 places where they have shown interest were on the first floor: one room with blue light of exposition (nothing really special, but it shows how little is needed to make kids interested) and another room containing 2 human skeletons. I would prefer my kids to see less but be interested and motivated - many museums in the world understand this and add some simple quests for the kids (ex. find 5 Athenas) or some little interactive games (ex. distinguish different Greek gods). Otherwise, it is tough for kids and as a result tough for adults as well. For adults something more complex can be done in our time of computers and applications. Another comment is regarding the guards in the museum rooms. They are probably bored with their job, and are not paid for anything apart from words like \"Don't touch the glass\" or \"You should not copy the pose of a statue\" - this last demand surprised me since I've never heard of it anywhere. I've asked \"why\" and the answer was \"it is a museum rule\". I believe every rule should have a reason and I was really interested in the reason behind this demand, maybe some story or something else.And I find it a shame that a person working in a museum did not (want to) explain it to us (visitors).\n",

The statue of Zeus (or is it Poseidon?) has been known to bring on attacks of Stendhal's syndrome to visitors, and even a relative philistine like myself can see why. He stands about 3 metres tall, and the sculpture is utterly perfect. You can see the veins on his arms and hands, the sweat on his brow, the overwhelming strength of movement of a god captured in an instant, and the empty eyes glower menacingly at whatever has incurred his wrath. All of that is on top of the fact that this work of art was already ancient when Jesus was crucified. But the child riding a horse, Agamemnon's burial mask, and the Antikythera Shipwreck marbles in the garden-patio outside the museum's café, the collection of ancient tombstones and busts, all took my breath away. The museum shop is defintely worth a visit too.\n",

The relatively few visitors meant no problems with getting good photos with no distracting bodies. Getting there was easy using the metro from the Acropolis - get on line 2 (red) and get off at Omonoia.  You could also walk the 3 km if the weather is good.We went with a downloaded audio tour from Rick Steves (free on line) which was a useful guide.My only disappointment was that the room with the famous statue of Aphrodite,Pan, and Eros was closed for no obvious reason.

This is a big museum as it has got much more displays than the Acropolis museum. It has packed with the most famous and extraordinary collections from 7,000 BC to 700 AD. The main highlights included:i) A vast volume of gold artefacts and exquisite jewellery found from the Royal Tombs of Mycenae in 15th century BC. They also display a lot of founding of potteries, vases and glass vessels from the 10th century BC.ii) The Archaic Kourous and Kore statues from 7th century BC to 480 BC (Cycladic civilisation). This was the beginning of Greek art evolution when the Greek artists learnt how to depict the body to its perfection rather than to the reality. Every statue body was made stiff and all shared the same standard features.iii) The Bronze works collections from the golden age (480 BC to 400 BC). During this period, skill was improved and statues were created more realistic and many statues posed like human. One of the most famous sculptures was the Poseidon or Zeus of Artemision from the 460 BC. You would also find a lot of Vases displayed in the Bronze collections section.iv) The Hellenistic period of arts. This was the Hellenistic period starting from about 300 BC, when the sculptures were improved even further by being created more vigorous and had more emotions. One of the most famous examples was the energetic \"Horse and the Jockey of Artemision\" from the 2nd century BC (on the ground floor)v) The Odyssey's exhibition. In here, you would find a mixture of displays from the golden age to the Hellenistic period, i.e. \"the statue of Poseidon\" (480 BC), the \"Marble statue of Odysseus\" (1st BC), to the \"Group of Aphrodite, Pan and Eros\" (100 BC). vi) The garden on the lower ground floor. The garden is beautiful on its own but it also displays a collections of sculptures from the Hellenistic period, such as \"The Sleeping of Eros\". The museum cafe next to the garden is fully air conditioned so it's a MUST GO during the summer.National Archaeological museum is a massive museum and is the best museum in Greece. Although it's a bit far from city centre and there is no metro station nearby, but it's still worth the effort to get there. Especially if you are interest in Greek Art history.Highly recommended.Tip: (If you go there by Metro, the nearest metro station is Omonia and it takes about 10 minutes walk from the station towards the north. There are lots of organised pickpockets waiting outside the station and they target tourists. It's better to travel in groups and be extra careful.)\n",

Most regional museums (with the exception of Heraklion on Crete) pale in comparison. Walk first around the sculpture perimeter that surrounds the core of the museum. Here you will see excellent stone and bronze sculptures that are thousands of years old and that show the high artistic standard of these times. The core of the museum offers mostly the smaller objects (daily use items, jewelry, etc.) in glass vitrines. There is also a changing exhibit a the back of the museum that is worth a visit as it done up more to current viewing style and includes audiovisual displays.

Your plan may however by frustrated by galleries being closed (one was shut when visitors were in it when I was there, which is a little annoying). There is a great deal to see, almost too much, and it pays to be selective.  At the current time, several works have been brought together in an excellent exhibition around the Odyssey.All the collections are excellent and are worth visiting but, whatever you do, don't miss the treasure from the tombs in Mycenae (the local museum only has copies) and the wall paintings from Thera.   There is also a small exhibition of contemporary sculpture, which adds a nice touch, linked in with the historic sculpture around it.  In addition to the artwork, there are stories to read about many of the discoveries, sometimes by accident by fishermen at sea, which suggests that there may well be more to be discovered.

The collection is astounding, with several world-famous pieces, and the sculptures are laid out in a plan that makes historical sense. I was also surprised by the quality of their holdings in jewelry and gold, as well as their sizable Egyptian collection. The cafe, although it doesn't have an extensive menu, does boast a lovely garden setting. It takes about two thirds of a day to do the whole place justice (although the best sights are all on the ground floor). Don't miss it.\n",

The big ticket item in this collection is the Funeral Mask of Agamemnon. Its a bit like the Mona Lisa in The Louvre in Paris - everyone rushes to see it and it is amazing but there are plenty of other incredible items in that collection as well. Another great collection is the Sculptures Collection, which contains sculptures from seventh to the fifth centuries BC. The big ticket sculpture is the bronze statue of Zeus. The Vase and Minor Objects Collection houses Greek pottery from the eleventh century BC to the Roman period. The Santorini collection contains the frescoes and many of the original items that you would have seen if you visited Akrotiri on Santorini (highly recommended).  There is also Egyptian Antiquities area with works dating from 5000 BC to the Roman era.This is one of the world's most important museums. Don't let the unloved facade and sad neglected garden at the front (and area that it is in) put you off visiting this magnificent collection of antiquities. It also has a lovely sculpture garden just downstairs to the back of the toilets that is a nice place to sit for a bit to get away from the heat.\n",

It houses some of the most important artifacts from a variety of archaeological locations around Greece from prehistory to late antiquity. That’s why it is considered one of the greatest museums in the world and indeed it contains a very reach collection of artifacts from Greek antiquity worldwide. The initial name for the museum was The Central Museum and I understood it was renamed to its current name in 1881, by the Prime Minister of Greece Charilaos Trikoupis. The Museum is organized in many collections: Prehistoric collection, Neolithic era and early and mid-Bronze age collection, Cycladic art collection, Mycenaean art collection, Heinrich Schliemann finds, Egyptian Art collection, Stathatos collection. We spent almost three hours inside this beautiful Museum, which has undergone an important refurbishment, just before the 2004 Olympic Games. We really enjoyed strolling around the various corridors and rooms, which are exhibiting all these superb artifacts from the antiquity.\n",

The neoclassical building the collection is housed in was constructed over a 22-year period and was finished in 1889. During World War II, the artifacts were sealed in protective boxes and buried, to prevent looting by the Germans.One of the highlights for me was the larger-than-life Artemision Bronze statue discovered in 1928 from a shipwreck north of Athens. Zeus or Poseidon, it's not sure which, is in the midst of throwing either a spear or a trident, depending on who it is. He stands an imposing 6-feet-10 and the statue dates from about 460 B.C.In a separate room, a similar marble statue of Poseidon is equally impressive. A dolphin supports his right leg as he throws a missing trident. This statue dates from about 125 B.C.The collection includes treasures from across Greece and many of her islands. There are busts and paintings and cups. I visited the museum on my last day in Athens.

We spent about 3 hours here and still didn't manage to get around to seeing everything.While it's not as modern and as well laid out as the Acropolis Musuem, there is a lot of information and many exhibits in here.Entrance is EUR 10 per adult and guided tours are available in a few languages, but I believe they are EUR 50 per group and how much you pay will depend on how many are in your group. You could possibly supplement your visit with some downloaded material before your visit, however there is a decent amount of information posted around the museum. It would be nice to have the offer of audio guides.Photography is allowed, however don't use your flash. Also the museum attendants are quite vigilant on anything that appears to be disrespectful behaviour towards the exhibits or the culture, so you won't be bothered by other visitors.TIP: Visiting here before visiting the archaeological sites would definitely improve your experience. We visited the museum on the last day, and it put the final pieces in the puzzle for us.\n",

It is quite repetitive, and some sections are easily skippable. It doesn't compare at all to worlds great museums, aka British museum.

It is huge and well laid out in spacious galleries. Get a map and hold on to your ticket - if you pass back out into the lobby accidentally you'll need to be able to scan it to get back in to the exhibits. Wear sneakers or your feet will complain.There's a small cafe where you can get a toasted sandwich downstairs, and a reasonably priced, though small, museum shop. There are lifts within the building which allow disability access, and it is cool/air conditioned. The groups/buses seem thickest from 12-2pm, but when I was there it honestly wasn't too much of an issue - people were generally considerate of each other. You are allowed to take photos without flash. Selfies are discouraged everywhere in Greek museums though.

The museum is very well organised to demonstrate the evolving styles and attitudes to sculpture from idealistic depictions in ancient times to far more naturalistic sculpture in the early centuries AD.There are a number of special exhibitions where a number of items recovered from a single excavation have been collected together to give a strong sense of a particular site alongside the more chronological approach of the general exhibits.There is also an exhibition of the Antikythera Mechanism. This is a unique exhibit which explains the finding of a mechanism found aboard the Antikythera ship wreck. The archaeologists found that the mechanism was an ancient mechanical computer created to measure time and lunar cycles. It's true evidence of exceptionally advanced society.As with all the museums we visited in Greece, this is well laid out, thoughtfully curated and organised and the information available alonside the exhibits was excellent.\n",

Personally we found there was just too much to see and would have preferred it to be broken up a little more but I would definitely say every visitor to Athens should make an effort to visit.\n",

There are also wonderful pottery and marble statues on display, dating back to millennia BC.The Museum opens at 8am in the summer which means an easy riser can see a great deal in comparative isolation before the tour groups arrive.  The cafe is in a lovely garden setting in the atrium with free wifi.Highly recommended.\n",

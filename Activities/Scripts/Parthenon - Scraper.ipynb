I agree with many others - the crowds do tend to ruin it, as they seem to only wish to take selfies, but one cannot really blame the site for that! What is irksome is that the ongoing debate between maintaining an ancient site and reconstructing it could well be focused on this very building. It sits, at present, on a very obvious modern concrete plinth, and is a building works. Quite clearly a lot of the features are being replaced in what is believed to be their original place with the aid of steel and concrete. It greatly improves its silhouette against the sky beloved of a million tourist photos, but it's not original. Similarly, the ancillary buildings on the site have the look of 'let's see if this stone will fit here'. It's an ongoing debate, and I agree others prefer a reconstruction to a heap of stones, but - personally- I think it's being taken too far.\n",

To avoid the queues, buy a combination ticket at one of the other sites (e.g., Aristotle’s Lyceum, where there is never a queue) and then enter via the south entrance (also known as the skip the queue entrance, or entrance for small groups). Also go first thing in the morning (we entered at 8:20, by 9:30 it was absolutely heaving and there was a real loss of mystique) or perhaps late in the day. There’s not a lot of shade and no refreshments on sale on the site, nor any cover if it rains. The information boards are ok – better to read up before you go, to understand the intricacies of how the temple was made and the architectural techniques used to create the optical illusions. Obviously, there are frequent mentions of the Elgin marbles in the British Museum, and these are not complimentary.\n",

The ticket is good for 5 days and you can visit each site once.Although early it was already very hot so I went round at a slow pace taking any opportunity for shade and to refill my water bottle that I could get. Going up the south slope the highlight was the Theatre of Dionysus. However the true highlights were yet to come. As I went toward the summit you got to view down toward the Herodes Atticus Theatre which is extensively restored and a very impressive sight.Next came the Acropolis summit itself. I had high expectations for here but they were surpassed and more. Walking up through the Propylaia (entrance way) and viewing the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the overall area was amazing. My favourite area was at the back of the Parthenon ( it’s east side I think), simply standing there trying to take it all it. Yes it was was very hot and a bit crowded but at this stage none of that mattered. I won’t bother with any more superlatives but just say it’s a morning I will long remember.\n",

Yes it was quite busy, but I still managed to get some great pictures without busy-body tourists ruining the shots, and even though it was warm it was pleasant. We were lucky enough to visit on a sunny day, and just seing it up close against that blue background was amazing. We were also given the tip to go across to the top of the hill overlooking the Parthenon for a great sunset shot, and that was indeed spectacular. Wish I had had more time to explore - could have spent so much longer there, just meandering around. Do not miss this!\n",

The pathways are slippery and some of the steps are high, unfortunately a lady behind us fell down several, so be careful and take it slow!  The Parthenon has been under renovation for 10 years, so it wasn’t what we see in pictures, but it didn’t make the awe any less! Definitely a must see when in Athens! At least once in a lifetime!\n",

I DEFINITELY recommend hiring one of the tour guides. Our tour guide was Aspia and she was brilliant. She’s certified in about seven languages too. The certified guides have badges they wear and can show you. We were very impressed how well organized everything is. Aspia also told us that the Parthenon is being renovated and should be completed with a roof in about three years! It is so impressive to stand in the acropolis and marvel at the Parthenon and imagine what happened so many years ago. The engineering genius it took and the logistics of transporting the marble are impressive. You MUST visit the Parthenon while in Athens! It looks like it will be a very high hike but in reality it isn’t bad at all and doesn’t take to long to climb.\n",

Unfortunately, and this is probably in part due to the fact that I present as fully abled, when I asked to be showed to the elevator, the workers were rude and dismissive and basically told me I couldn't. My boyfriend and I had to argue and insist that they show us the elevator, and only when another worker appeared and heard us arguing did they help us.

Also, the walk to the entrance was filled with aggressive scam artists trying to place friendship bracelets on your wrist to make you pay for them, \"official\" tour guides, and post card sellers. I recommend buying tickets online so you can walk right past the ticket line. In the off-season, they're half price (10 euros). There was a snack and drink stand (slushies, water, crackers), small gift shop, and restrooms before entering the attraction. Masks have to be worn the entire time even though you are outside. There are attendants with whistles that monitor this and keep people from climbing on the ruins.

While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles (c. 495–429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the buildings whose present remains are the site's most important ones, including the Parthenon.  The Parthenon was the center of religious life in the powerful Greek City-State of Athens, the head of the Delian League. Built in the 5 century B.C., it was a symbol of the power, wealth and elevated culture of Athens. It was the largest and most lavish temple the Greek mainland had ever seen.  The main purpose of the Parthenon was as a temple for Athena, virgin goddess and patron of Athens. The building's very name means “the virgin's place” in Greek.It was certainly an amazing experience to finally visit this historic and spiritual building.\n",

When you do get a ticket, make sure to go for the 30 euros combined one as there are lots to see with the ticket especially the Ancient Agora. Once you get queue to get in, it takes say 3 - 5 minutes and a big walk-up, take as many photos as you like, we went at midday, it was busy but not too busy (This is in October end of the peak season).Glad I ticked this off my bucket list but for me, I would rather be in a cafe enjoying a lovely coffee in the numerous coffee shops in Athens.\n",

When temperatures get too high all outdoor sites are closed from noon-5pm each day throughout Greece (info as of August 3-12, 2021). So plan outdoor activities for the morning and save the hotter afternoon hours for indoor museums. A couple other recommendations, use the south ticket entrance (shorter lines) and use a guide for the Acropolis. The guide I used charged 100 Euros but if you have multiple people the cost can be divided up. It allows you to get priority entry and skip the lines (south entrance lines are shorter but still a long wait). The south entrance also allows you easy access to the Theatre of Dionysus.\n",

Some waited 30 - 60 minutes to reach the ticket office.   Next, when requesting to use the lift (which is available for people with health problems) my daughter who has a very painful leg and ankle due to a comminuted fracture of her tibia, was rudely told that she was \"not handicapped, but rather just had an injury\", which the rude young man at the gate said that he also had!   Next, along came an elderly lady official, who also rudely refused my daughter the use of the lift.   This put a sour note on the whole visit. Surely nobody would try to use the lift, if they did not genuinely have a health problem?   Customer service and attitude need to be addressed by staff.   The very existence of the Parthenon depends on the high fees charged to visitors - staff working there should not display such rudeness to visitors.  In fact, at the highest shrine and greatest pride of the nation, this was the only rudeness we experienced by the usually friendly and super-helpful Greek people.\n",

A strike or some other unforeseen occurrence would be understandable but this was just negligence and lack of concern about the people traveling there to see their amazing heritage. To make matters worse, we had only been at the top for a few minutes before the staff began harassing and herding us towards the exits. Many of us took pleasure in moving as slowly as possible and stopping to take many more pictures than we might otherwise have done.

      "Review text is :The Parthenon is one of the best known Greek historical monument in the world, whose images are seen very frequently; however, nothing is the same as like seeing it directly. Simply spectacular, for its history, grandeur, and location on one of the seven hills of Athens. For all of us who have Greek culture as our benchmark, it is an emotion difficult to describe, which goes beyond the simple visit to a historical monument. Walking where Plato and Aristoteles walked was a privilege.This was the second time I visited it, and I like it more and more this time. The satisfaction of being able to step on those ancient marbles together and being in the cradle of our civilization was an incomparable experience. Although there was some scaffolding due to the deteriorated state of some structures, I loved visiting it. It is a unique monument whose greatness can only be appreciated by observing it live and directDespite the heat of Athens in June (visited on June 2019), you can't help but admire the Parthenon. Depending on the time of year the weather could be very hot. Visiting this icon of history and art was a wonderful thing, although you have to walk a lot (everything is uphill. It costs to climb the steep inclines), it is worth it; there are also spectacular views. Watch out for some stones because they could slip. It is advisable to wear sensible shoes, bring an umbrella, a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a bottle of water. After you pass the turnstiles (at the entrance) there are no services except WCs, so bring with you snacks, guidebooks, camera batteries, etc. Because in the summer the heat is suffocating, go at an appropriate time to enjoy it peacefully. If you use a wheelchair, you can use a special elevator. Just go around the left side of the hilltop, from the ticket booth. But once up, you will need help due to the uneven terrain.Athens is worth visiting even just for visiting the Acropolis, and already inside the Acropolis, the Parthenon is the most relevant work. It is an impressive masterpiece of ancient Greek architecture. To contemplate such a place is indescribable. I think the thrill of seeing it for the first time can only be overcome by the feeling of being able to admire it at night from the fifth floor of the Hilton hotel. It is one of my most wonderful experiences.Even if you are not an art or history lover, it is worth visiting it. It is impressive to walk through those ruins, which saw so many events and people important to our history go by. Being in the cradle of civilization moved me the most, knowing that it was a temple, then the Turks used it as gunpowder storage. In 1687 when The Venetian army laid siege to the Acropolis, a hit of mortar fire triggered a massive explosion that ripped the center out of the Parthenon and wiped out the Turkish defenders. Besides the destruction, almost everything is still there. It was a marvelous thing that invaded me, as I entered through the Propylaea it gave me a taste of the Parthenon to come.\n",

It can be hard, but you can feel the rewards of going up many stairs to see it. Although it was damaged a lot, when I saw it, I felt like I was back in ancient Greece. The Parthenon was a magnificent and luxurious construction. Of course, the building itself is wonderful, but if you know the Greek history related to this temple in advance, you can look at it more deeply. So, I recommend you to build up your historical knowledge of Greece in advance and come here.Besides the Parthenon, there are more wonderful historical sites nearby.

I’m more than happy to say that finally this year in January I rectified that and visited Athens and The Parthenon! My first view of it came from the top of the street where I exited the Metro, and it didn’t disappoint. Gleaming in the midday sun on top of the Acropolis it was nearer than I expected it to be. The tariff was 10€ to access the site. On the way up I saw the Greek theatre of Dionysus and further up the larger Roman theatre of Herodion, and from the top the view of the different districts of Athens from the Parthenon is spectacular. The Parthenon itself had scaffolding around it, because of the ongoing restoration work, but it doesn’t detract too much from the majesty of the building itself. It’s more in tact than I thought, and it’s well worth the climb, which on the whole wasn’t as bad as I expected. The day before I went to the Parthenon I visited the Acropolis museum which helped, because I then knew some of the history behind this magnificent building. At the top there’s also remnants of other temples, but the Parthenon takes centre stage.There were quite a few other tourists there, but not as many as I would imagine there would be in summer, and the weather was perfect for climbing the hill, another plus point for visiting in the cooler months. If you’ve never been before I would highly recommend it!\n",

Also prices are cheaper for concessions. Need non slippy shoes as it can be bare marble and rock. We were offered guided tour for 100 euros for an hour which was ridiculous for two of us, she did keep coming down but unless there are a few of you it is not worth it. Plenty of information boards and the view is terrific. On reflection we wished we had visited the museum first as there are two really good films shown which puts it more in perspective.It is impressive and interesting to see the restoration work.

The view from the top is fantastic.  The ruins are stunning and you can see the whole city.  It’s definitely worth the hike up to see the view.

Once we got to the front gate and bought tickets, we asked if an elevator for handicapped was available as we had one child with a disability. We had to show a proof of disability. (If you are just old, or have a heart condition, or have a baby in a stroller, you will NOT be allowed on this elevator and your only other option is walking). Luckily, elevator for disabled is available!What was a bit unusual is that the grandfather, who was accompanying our child in the elevator because the child cannot go alone, was then asked (just prior to the elevator) to fill in additional paperwork. He filled it out and they both were taken up to the top and waited for the rest of the group who climbed.

Things to remember- if it rains, the platform lift for the stairs may not work and if there are high winds, the elevator is shut down. The trip to the top and the walk around was a life experience. My wife who had polio and uses crutches and a wheelchair could see the majority of the Acropolis site and the scenery. The Acropolis Museum is also outstanding.

It's worth googling!  Therefore, I do not know the entrance price, but if you've gone all the way to Greece, it's well worth it.The top of the Acropolis, around the Parthenon, is bare rock and can be very slippery away from the paths, so wear sturdy shoes with good grip.  The steps and paths to the top aren't too steep.  Take a water bottle and a hat if it's hot and/or sunny.You may read reviews complaining about the staff, but they are doing their best to protect this amazing site, so treat them with respect.If you are visiting Athens just once, this is the first place you should visit.\n",

Kids are free (even foreigners from outside the EU) but they still need a ticket to enter the sites. Hours are 8 am - 6 pm in Winter and tickets become less expensive starting in November.None of the museums are included in the 30 euro multi site pass. There are a lot of street vendors surrounding the Acropolis selling food drinks and souvenirs. You cannot take food inside the Acropolis.

The steps were steep and rather slippery given they are mostly worn down marble slaps. Because there are so many tourists all somewhat lost and wandering, you have to be very careful of your surroundings.  The Parthenon is under reconstruction on a couple of sides.  You can actually see how they blend in the new marble with the old to restore some of the columns.  All of that said, it's a pretty spectacular thing to see.

      "Review text is :All the scaffolding, cranes, machinery, rail tracks built into the ground obviously to transport heavy blocks.. all the big metal things, all the cctv cameras and metal shack staffrooms.. barrier ropes,  just absolutely ruins the authenticity of the site. When I went to the Parthenon I thought the whole site was an absolute mess. Massive shame to see boxes, containers and other bits of clutter everywhere. Absolutely ridiculous. Also stupid massive plastic information boards detailing the restoration, pretty much nothing interesting anyway that stands in the way blocking the view of the temple itself. Even the ugly staff room buildings that look like tin shacks block the view. Utterly ridiculous how long and how many years it has been taking for the restoration works on the Parthenon. Whoever has been in charge of the Parthenon is giving the site too much of a modern touristy feel to it. This is supposed to be a sacred temple. It should Ether be completely rebuilt it to its former glory, or nothing at all, because at the moment.. all the stupid construction materials and ladders everywhere makes it look a cluttered messy place. Whoever is in charge of mainting it is a complete idiot. There were even large plastic bags full of construction materials everywhere. Random bags of things all over the place. Walking onto the grounds of the Parthenon the first thing you see is a large metal modern machine. Whoever is managing the site is not doing any justice to the original builders. This was a sacred place for the Gods. Now there are huge information boards that glorify the restoration workers and the management more than its ancient builders or Gods. This is a disaster. An absolute shame. I was very angry when I seen the Parthenon. Too much wooden sticks, scaffolding and other rubbish everywhere. I am certainly sure with the amount of time it has taken to make a few collumns smoother and whiter... the whole thing could have just been rebuilt, with all its statues returned, repaired and reattached. Restoration is ridiculous. The site should be completely rebuilt. I want to see all of its marbles intact on every side. I want to see a perfect roof and I want to go inside it without rope and members of staff stopping me. The Parthenon should be a Temple that should again house a shrine and giant statue to Athena. It should be made to look as it once used did in its prime. The way it looks now just makes you think that modern day Greek people are losing their culture.\n",

We have learned of its history as first dedicated to Athena, then in Christian times became a church dedicated to the  Virgin Mary and later on became a mosque during the Ottoman occupation.  Yes, it is still being restored from damages of the past, especially from the destruction wrought in the 17th century by the Italian Morosini because the Parthenon was used then as storage of Turkish artillery. What words can be added here to describe the marvelous building whose structure began in the 5th century BC?  How the architects then leaned the columns slightly inwards, gave the columns a slight bulge and we are told they didn't use straight lines but the optical illusion is one of perfection! Happily some the Parthenon's sculptures have been saved for us to admire at various museums of the world. Experiencing the Parthenon is almost a time travel to the Greek classical past!\n",

I really cannot imagine it being a really pleasant experience in the height of the summer when it is packed.  Anyway, it was very beautiful and it was interesting to see the ancient ruins after studying them prior to the trip.  I recommend doing light reading on the Acropolis prior to going.  The only drawback to the location is the terrain if you are mobility impaired.  I am not - I am super healthy and agile and I still found it a bit treacherous.  In fact, I fell when I lost my footing on a rock - literally tumbled forward resulting in scratches and bruising (d’oh).  Because I am fit, I could bounce right up and keep moving along but anyone that is not in good health may not be able to get up and it is not easy to get back down. I had on sneakers but my recommendation to anyone that goes would be to wear hiking shoes.  All that being said, it is worth the trip!  Just plan wisely.  Wear appropriate attire - no flip flops, heels, or slippery shoes; wear a back pack or some other hand free bag to carry your stuff (I used a Patagonia cross body Black Hole bag), and bring some water (it gets hot up on the hill!).\n",

It can be seen from many locations in the city.Since it is part of the Acropolis visit, on site surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propleia and the Erechtheion.Today, luckily the basic structure still remains tall compared to other ruins in Athens.  It gives a glimpse at the general overall size and imposing arrangement.My suggestions for your visit:1.\tSkip the lineBuy a multisite ticket at another attraction and pass the ticket booth.You can go to one of the following less crowded attractions: Ancient Agora, Roman Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Temple of Olympian Zeus, Kerameikos, Aristotle’s SchoolSo when you get to the Acropolis ticket booth you do not need to do the line-up! The difference in price was totally worth it to us.2.\tVisit the Acropolis Museum firstUnfortunately you can’t skip the line at the museum but it is a good way to see the original version of the art with more details.3.\tAllow sufficient timeGive yourself time to enjoy the Parthenon but the other buildings as well and also the view of the city below.4.\tPickpocketsCareful at the bottom of the Acropolis near the ticket booth yep! It happened to me – group of young girls.5.\tClimbI’m not so in shape and the climb was easy, so do it, try. On your way up, go at your rhythm and stop.  Sometimes, you can be surprise of things you can see when you sit down and look around. Don’t miss the Dionysus theatre.\n",

These were mostly passengers of the big cruise ships arriving to the Greek capital. So take in consideration that climbing up and walking on the top will be very slow. The Parthenon, with it’s most famous columns, is under heavy restorations which apparently started in 1983. We learned that the monument was restored between 1900 to 1930, but the use of iron reinforced concrete and iron clamps which later corroded and expanded provoked serious damages to the ancient marble and also caused serious structural problems. So in 1983 they began a new restoration journey. Three of the first 5 columns on the east were restored with the use of material whose original position has been identified, while two other columns  were fully restored with new marble. Since 2015 the final carving of their flutes is taking place.On the west side of the Parthenon 8 central columns were restored after misplacements errors of the previous intervention were corrected.\n",

If it rains they become extremely slippery so take your runners or some comfortable shoes with grip.Another tip is to go as early as possible to avoid the crowds as it get extremely busy and if you don’t do crowds well your not going to like it too much.The structures are massive and quite mind blowing and the view from up there is next level so be sure to take your camera or phone and battery up.Be sure to visit the museum first though as this provides you with a lot of clarity about the structures when you get there.\n",

Once you hit the top of the Acropolis, watch your step, some very slippery stones and uneven parts, might ruin your visit.It’s a shame that the undergoing restoration, does not allow you to visit the interior, but the outside, will amaze your eyes and souls.The place claims its justified greatness; you’ll walk in time, through centuries of rich history and heritage.

We opted for a tour guide, which was a waste of money (we think that we were scammed, since she claimed to be an English speaking tour guide but could barely string a sentence together). A few of the other tours we saw going around the site looked great though, and we would highly recommend getting one since there is so much history to the place! Without one you'll just be wandering around an ancient site not knowing what anything is.I would highly recommend taking a sun hat, suncream and sturdy shoes since the ground is exceptionally slippy and uneven!Definitely worth the visit though, and if you're in Athens for a few days, invest in the combined ticket which enables you to visit the ancient sites on one ticket for 30€ (free is you're and EU student that can prove student status. I showed my university card and signed into my university account to prove studentship!). Invest in your ticket at one of the quieter attractions if you're planning to get one.

If visiting in the summer, go early!  I arrived at 8:30am and it was already a bit crowded.  By 10am, when we started to head down, it was even more packed.  Wear sunscreen and hat, as there is little shade at the top. It was also cooler in the morning.3.  Plan on at least 30 minutes to come down.  This is important if you are meeting a tour bus or guide. I was with a tour group from a cruise ship and it took one couple 45 minutes to get down.  Why?  The rocks are uneven and very slippery.  Furthermore, you leave through the same gate as you enter.\n",

This restoration has not been undertaken to return the Parthenon to its former use as a Temple of Athena, the way the Odeon has been restored to continue serving its purpose as a theater; it is just a disrespectful cash-in.

Be aware that coach tours just go straight to the front. A good tip is to get in their line to get a quick entry. Once inside it’s ok but their are steep steps to climb and the ground is very rough with marble cobbles. I last went six years ago and little has changed with the restoration programme,it hasn’t moved on much in the last six years. You would think that with thousands of visitors a day at €20 a time it would be rebuilt quickly,but I suppose they have a national debt to repay. Be aware it hot and tiring and a steep climb\n",

This temple took 15 years to complete and is the only one built of white Pentelic marble.  the Parthenon is located at the Acropolis - Acrop meaning the top and olis - meaning city.The Parthenon served several purposes in history.  At one point it was turned into a mosque.  During WW II it was turned into storage for gunpowder and ultimately exploded, turning the temple to ruins.The hill where these ruins remain is where the Apostle, Paul, preached the Gospel  of Christ.  It is also the location where the first vote was made declaring Greece a democracy in the fourth century A.D.The nightlife in Athens is incredible and a return to the Parthenon at night when it is completely lit is well worth the visit.  As in any city where there are large groups of people, vigilance is a necessity.  Be aware of the people around you.  Carry your backpack/handbag in front of you, or not at all.  My wallet with I.D., one credit card and minimal cash is in the front pocket of my pants or inside pocket of my jacket.  Greece's currency is the Euro, meaning any Euros you have accumulated from other travels are accepted.  I always wondered if merchants questioned why Irish Euros ended up in Italy!\n",

      "Review text is :If you are in Athens, the Parthenon in the Acropolis complex is a must see. Looking up at it, the path may seem like a challenge, but it's really not. Just make sure you wear shoes with a good grip because there are sections of the path (especially near the top) that are smooth marble, and they would be very slippery if wet. It costs 20 Euros to enter the Acropolis which also includes the Theatre of Dionysus and the magnificent, Odeon of Herodes Atticus, which is still in use today. At the top, in addition to the Parthenon, are the Temple of Athena Nike and the Erechtheum. There are also incredible views of the city below. TIP: if you want to visit addition historic sites, for 10 Euros more  you can get into all of them. I recommend you go to one of the other sites first, where there are no lines, buy the package ticket and save yourself more than an hour wait in the hot sun at the Acropolis. You might also find a convenient online site to purchase tickets in advance. Go early (opens at 8:00) when it's cooler and the least crowded. Or wait until later afternoon (open until 20:00 in the summer). Two to Three hours is plenty of time to enjoy the Parthenon and the rest of the Acropolis at your leisure. Researching ahead of time and looking at the maps, I was unable to determine what all was included. Be aware that the Rome Agora, Ancient Agora (which includes the must-see, most complete, Temple of Hephaestus), Temple of Zeus, Hadrian's Library, etc. are NOT included with the Acropolis ticket, but ARE included for the 30 Euro combination ticket.No water or refreshments are available inside the Acropolis complex so take water with you or purchase it outside the park before you enter. Especially important on hot days.Again, the walk up isn't that difficult, but wear good shoes (sandals not recommended) and watch your step with all the slippery and uneven surfaces and you will be fine. My two friends had decided not to go to the top once they were at the base looking up at it, but then after viewing both theaters, part way up, they found themselves up there with very little difficulty.\n",

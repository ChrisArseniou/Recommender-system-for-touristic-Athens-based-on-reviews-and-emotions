Originally it was a steep sloped theatre with three storey stonewall having expensive lebanese wooded roof and got destroyed entirely in 261 AD. This was partially restored in 1950 with meticulous care and then onwards Athens Festival was held here every year.

      "Review text is :No one can deny that a performance in the ancient (174 A.D.) theatre of the Odeon on the hill of the Acropolis is nothing short of magical in the magnificent acoustics and ambience. We attended the sold out concert of Andrea Bocelli in September and were  totally mesmerized by his voice and the venue!  We had attended a MariaFarantouri  “Tribute to Theodorakis” concert in 2001, but our legs were a lot stronger then! My husband now walks with a cane and this time I had to take into consideration the many stone steps and the hard stone seats without any back support in this ancient theatre. BUT.....we so wanted to hear Bocelli sing in this venue! So.... the day the tickets went on sale (It sold out instantly).....I bought handicapped section tickets and tried with much effort after the fact, to see how we would manage the logistics involved.  The day before the actual concert, we even took a taxi near the Odeon’s entrance (a trial run) and found that even the cobbled stone street and steps without railing, were a lot for my husband. Realizing that this was an opportunity of a lifetime and still not sure how we would manage - or if we’d be spending the night under the stars of the Acropolis! - we took a taxi to the closest point of the pedestrian walkway. The purpose of this review is to help other people with walking challenges who might be reluctant to attend a concert at the Odeon; also to sing the praises of an incredibly well-organized, professional, and caring staff!We found out that the Odeon is extremely sensitive to its handicapped visitors. When arriving by taxi, we had only to speak to Security. My husband’s name was on a list, so he was allowed taxi access right to the entrance of the theatre! He was then offered a chair while waiting for the gates to open. When the gates opened, all handicapped visitors were personally escorted to their seats. These seats had cushions and he was even offered a back rest! Upon leaving the theatre, the same escorts ordered taxis for us. It truly made the event stress-free for us. I was incredibly impressed! It truly exceeded our expectations! I hope that this information helps other handicapped people who might be reluctant to go to an Odeon concert. It was perfect in every way!Photography is not allowed within the Odeon once a performance has started.\n",

Lights were changing colors and  moving around and because of the ruins the effect was great. Don't sit at the two ends. You will miss the experience of looking straight at the stage. Go early if you do not have a numbered sit. Go at least 1-1.5 hours earlier. Expect long queues, but moves quickly when doors open. Leaving the concert will take some time.\n",

      "Review text is :The Herod Atticus Odeon ampitheater was originally built in 161 AD.  It was envisioned by the Athenian magnate Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, Aspasia Annia Regilla. It was originally built as a steep-sloped theater.  It had a three-story stone front wall and a wooden roof made of expensive cedar of Lebanon timber.  It was used as a venue theater and music.  The original capacity was 5,000. It lasted intact for 428 years.  It was destroyed and left in ruins by the Heruli in 267 AD.  I has been partially rebuilt.  The audience stands and the stage for the orchestra and/or performers were restored using pentelic marble in the 1950s. The marble comes from the famous Mount Penteli, where most of the marble used for major constructions in Athens came from.  Since being partially restored it has become the main venue of the Athens Festival, which runs from May through October each year, featuring a variety of acclaimed Greek as well as International performances.  It is also used for various concerts, theatrical events, and musical and vocal performances.  It is famous for having the absolute  best performers of Greece and from around the world.  It is quite and experience to sit in the marble seats and imagine which Athenians or Greeks mave have on been in the theater.  The acoustics are wonderful and this is due to strictly adhering to the original basic constructions.\n",

We did not get a chance to see any concerts or plays but they should be memorable.  The Odeon is all part of your Acropolis admission ticket. You should get the combined ticket which is 30 euro and covers most of the best archaeological sites. Buy it at Temple of Zeus or any site other than the Acropolis to avoid the long lines.  I would recommend going in the months other that July and August.  We were there in May and it was still very busy and hot, we could imagine how crazy it would be in the peak summer months.

      "Review text is :Like everyone-else says, if you are in Athen it will be memorable to go to the concert here.  However I found it very difficult to find the below practical information I wish I could find it easy, so here goes for the future audiences:-Reserve the tickets early so you have the preferred seats.  -Pretty much anywhere you get the good view but do NOT reserve the ticket in the middle seats away from the isles if you are planning to be there relatively late, or if you think you may need to go bathroom within 2hours of the showtime is over. There was NO intermission and it seems to be that way (there was the vibe of \"this is normal to sit here 2 hours\" from locals.  It will be VERY difficult to get to your seats and out of your seats.  -The door opens approximately 45min. before the showtime and it was easy to sit anywhere.  Most people start showing up 15min-20min before the show, but if your seats are away from the isles you will get the \"look\" from all the people who has to stand up and squeeze you in.  It's VERY tight, so just you know.-Wear casual or dressed up clothes, but ALWAYS wear the shoes you can climb up the slippery stairs easy-People with disability has its own entrances and seats-Bathroom is OUTSIDE of the ticket booth only, so DO go bathroom before the show. No intermission for 2hours and plus, and reserve isle seats if you have any bathroom issues.-There were cushions provided, but no back support.  Locals bring the back support of their own-Only STILL water inside.  no food, no parking water inside-Access is from the bottom side of the theater-same street as the Acropolis museum is located.\n",

It was destroyed by wars, marauders and plunderers during antiquity and restored in the 1950’s. It has a seating capacity of five thousand.

This theatre is open for certain performances if you are lucky enough to buy a ticket to a show, however, when you see it going up to the Acropolis, you may simply have a look from afar while on the other side of a fence which blocks it off. It is still a very nice view from here, allowing for beautiful pictures.\n",

The seating is open so we were able to get a seat in the first row of the top section. Each seat is provided a cushion so the hard surface was not too uncomfortable. Excellent concert experience as there were two piano concertos performed by world class soloists and orchestra. To please the local crowd there was also a performance of a composition by a Greek composer on the program. Beautiful venue with the Parthenon lit up high on the hill above and the Agoura and city below.

      "Review text is :Whenever I am in Athens, I check to see if my trip coincides with a performance at the Herod Atticus Odeon. This past trip I was in luck! We managed to catch a local troupe performing an ancient Greek play. It was in Greek, but they had English supertitles displayed on a monitor high above the back of the stage. Even without the translations, it was lovely to just look around, take in the ambiance, and realize you are sitting on/in and witnessing history come to life in this incredible venue. The theater has a regular rotation of international performers (I saw Japanese drummers years ago, and a Ukrainian dance troupe was performing the week after I was there), as well as big name acts (like Sting) from time to time. Do yourself a favor and check it out! You will not be disappointed, whatever the show. BTW logistics wise, you should book in advance (on line), as the shows sell out. Just outside the theater doors, there are restrooms on site and also a few refreshment stands with beverages (alcohol and non) and snacks. The theater seats have padding, though you may wish to bring your own, as well as a blanket, scarf or sweater (chilly nights and you are sitting in an open stone structure that does not keep heat). The \"bowl\" of the theater is rather steep and with narrow passages, so do wear stable shoes and use available handrails. Also, take a taxi or walk, as parking in the area (south/residential side of the Acropolis) is limited mostly to street parking.\n",

The show we took in was flamenco dancing and music to a capacity crowd of 5,000. This ancient amphitheater now has padded seats for modern day patrons, perhaps our ancient counterparts brought their own. The acoustics were great, though I wonder if amplification is really necessary. Dating to 161AD but rebuilt in the 1950's to it's current level it surely has seen thousands of performances all al fresco. The only downside is the ever present smart phones with their annoying flashes and screen light. Even in Greece patrons ignore the request to turn them off.

      "Review text is :Ever since I saw a Yanni concert on TV years ago, this ancient outdoor theater seemed magical to me. And so it is! I agree with other reviewers to try to see ANY show in this theater for a truly memorable experience. International acts appear here, so worth checking the schedule in advance of travel to Athens. I attended a tribute concert for Greek composer Manos Loizos on Sept 8 with an orchestra and 3 singers, which I greatly enjoyed. Theater plaza/getting to your seat: Before you enter the theater, take a picture from the plaza just outside the theater that includes a bit of a view to the Parthenon above. Several drink stands are available. WC facilities are on side of plaza. Central theater entrance is for seats from first row to about midway up. Another entrance has exterior steps to get to mid-level inside the theater from which you can walk up to higher seats. No handrails in aisles as you ascend to your seat, but helpful staff in aisles gave me a hand to steady my balance. Concert was a bit delayed to dry the seats and flooring from an earlier rain shower. (Important because marble is very slippery when wet!) Theater experience: Acoustics were great. Individual cushions are provided for the marble seating closer to the stage. No back support and limited space for your feet, but definitely doable for a few hours. Wheelchair seating was close to the stage. During the concert, a pleasant evening breeze came through the ancient arches behind the stage. Unexpected, but so appreciated! Bought a hologram postcard of this theater which shows it both today and how it was in ancient times, with a wooden roof. Would never have guessed!Tickets: Booked tickets in advance online. Of course, getting tickets ahead of time is reliant on good weather for a show in this open air theater.\n",

However Athenian locals (I'm Greek Australian, speak and read Greek, so can communicate and comprehend well) are arrogant and inconsiderate.I attended a concert here on 2 October. The odeon was full. The seating is a challenge, as only one row (at the front) has backs for the patrons/concert goers and the rest do not. The organisers of events attempt to fill the odeon in an orderly fashion, relative to seats/sections.It's when you leave that you are in danger of either falling or being squashed in the crowd.The problem is once the concert ends, the Athenians don't want to wait or exit from the point they entered. No, they want the complete opposite and they will verbally demand people move out of the way. After experiencing 3 hours of a wonderful concert, the whining and complaining and pushing at the end put a sour note into the experience. For example, we were in the lower tier, but after the end of the concert, we weren't able to exit via the lower tier because a group of Athenian women wanted to leave via the upper tier, followed by many others, who caused inconvenience and slowed the exit. An inconsiderate people.Athenians should be the guardians and custodians of their city, but they have no self respect or respect for other attendees at events.\n",

Be careful of what show you pick as some of them are in Greek and it’s going to be a very long show if you don’t understand Greek. They don’t allow food but you can drink water in there. No filming of photography is allowed either during the shows. The upper tier is generally in the €25–30. Prices go up as you go closer to the stage.Unfortunately, the show we saw started 27 mins late and was also very slow and boring. Otherwise the theater itself is wonderful to look at.Take a sweater as it can get cold. Given that this is a 1900-year-old theater, the seating is obviously not comfortable. Therefore, be prepared to have a sore back if the show is long. Unless you really want to go see a show, I would suggest just going to look at the theater during the day rather than subjecting yourself to sitting there for 1 to 2 hours.\n",

I was surprised that I was not uncomfortable due to the seats not have a back, but I was fine.  The rows of seats were sufficiently separated that it was nearly impossible to have someone seated in front of you blocking your few.  There was one intermission at which time those in the assigned seats got up and walked out - many to get a drink at the bar. The theatre appeared to be in a safe neighborhood and it was no problem so walk to the nearby Acropolis museum if you needed a cab or a late night snack and one of the many restaurants.  It was an unforgettable experience.  I highly recommend getting tickets if you have a chance.\n",

I accompanied my wife to Herod Atticus Odeon to watch the classic 1925 silent movie Battleship Potemkin with the Athens State Orchestra providing the soundtrack. What an amazing experience it turned out to be. The film was a bit so-so in my opinion but that wasn’t the point - the highlight of the night was the brilliant music played by the approx. 80 piece orchestra, the acoustics and the atmosphere in the theatre. It was just amazing and I was totally engrossed in the show from start to finish.Just sitting in the theatre was such an overwhelming experience. Looking around at the audience I felt as if I was sitting in the theatre as they would have been thousands of years ago.We attended this venue 2 days before we left Athens to return home. If we had only been there earlier in our trip – we would have returned to this magnificent theatre to appreciate another event.If you are the type of traveller who wants to experience the true culture of the locals then this is definitely an attraction that has to be seen to be appreciated.\n",

This was just a highlight of the trip to Athens- you climb to your seat and there are comfortable cushions set out on each level with the seat number-no seat backs I should add, which means you have to sit reasonably still noting that just behind your back is someone's legs and feet- but it all just works -  the local people knew more than us as they arrived just before the play started..less time sitting in not the most comfortable position- but would we have missed it?? Not for an instance- the actors were simply excellent and took us on the age old story of a wronged woman...it was theatre almost in the round, in the most atmospheric location, on a simply wonderful Athens evening - if you get a chance grab it and go.

They're much more comfortable than the others, which are benches only. During a longer show, these can become uncomfortable. Row 19 is the highest row in the lower bowl, so about half way up overall. The view and the acoustics were both absolutely excellent.Like most modern opera venues, there was a wide range of dress but most patrons were in the 'smart casual' category with collared shirts, dressy pants, and proper shoes.

It was the tallest building in Athens for 2,000 years (45-56 meters high) and was actually roofed! What was amazing was the fact that there were no support columns inside to hold the massive weight. 3,000 trees were needed for the wooden beams, weighing 750-800 tons. With the weight of the ceramic roof tiles, the roof is estimated to have weighed 1,000 tons! It was destroyed by fire in 267 A.D. by the Herules who had invaded Greece.\n",

      "Review text is :Historically, the Odeon of Herod Atticus was the third amphitheatre built in ancient Athens after the 5th-century BC Odeon of Pericles and the 1st-century AD Odeon of Agrippa.  Put up sometime around the mid-2nd century AD, it was built in memory of the sponsor's wife, the former being an important patron of the arts during Roman rule.  The current structure was largely restored in the early 1950s.  With the semicircular seats having been originally painstakingly hewn out of the rock, it seats approximately five thousand people comfortably and remains a dramatic venue for public performances.  Incidentally, the use of the word 'odeon' instead of 'theatre' implies that it was intended to host musical rather than drama performances (although that's not strictly true these days).  Visitors to the Acropolis will note that the Odeon is one of the first attractions encountered on the climb up the hill.  Unfortunately, apart from those times when the Athens & Epidaurus festival is being held or for other special occasions, access is restricted.  Nevertheless, the view from above the Odeon is quite stunning with a mosaic-covered central performance stage.  Unfortunately, with the passage of time, the wall stage now lies as ruins, a far cry from its heyday when it was covered in ceramic and marble decorations.\n",

As I entered the stage, for the tiniest second, the enormity of a full house rising in front of me in this ancient theater where amazing people had performed made me freeze...but only for that tiniest second. Then, the reality, the enormity of what was happening hit me , empowered me to sing as best I could smiling to the colorful audience, breathing in the strength I was getting from the Acropolis above, the full moon, the Odeon itself and the fellow singers....Go watch a show there!\n",

One is from the Ancient Agora site where you walk around the Acropolis for Gazi, and for cars there is the road that takes you up right next to it.

They were setting up a stage at the time so as I was walking back to my hotel, I inquired at the box office about what was playing.  The GreekNational Opera was performing Madama Butterfly that week.  I'm more of a play and symphony goer but the venue was too awesome to pass up.  And even though it was 108 degrees that day (cooling down to 97 as the sun set) it was packed with standing room only.  MB is long so I'm glad I purchased a seat and it was fantastic!

On our way back we stopped and played with a few cats, took in the scene and snapped a few photos. We went in early April and the weather was really great. Not too hot, but be prepared to force your way to prime photo spots with other tourists around this time. Leaving the area we were able to see the theater from the bottom but through some iron gates. Hard to take pics from there so creativity is a must. I wish i could rate this site better but unless you are going in to see a performance, you're not getting in.\n",

At about 10pm, an hour or so into the performance, a huge full moon came up from right behind the Parthenon, high above us on the Acropolis.  I could have died right then and been happy.....I was already in heaven!Shortly there-after, the lights went out in the orchestra pit.  The musos kept playing and after mild scuffling, the lights came on again.  Then the lights went off on the stage.  The ballerinas kept dancing (the moonlight was very bright) and a technician clumped across the stage, going \"mutter, mutter, mutter\", fiddled with the box on the back of the stage and the lights went on again.  The ballerinas kept dancing and the technician dodged them as he clumped doggedly off the stage, going \"mutter, mutter, mutter\".  Oh, well - nothing could dampen the delight of that night!

Nestling in the foothills of the Acropolis, the Odeon opened for business in 161 CE. We were lucky enough to see 'Tosca', and Greek singer Giannis Kotsiras (guest performer the wonderful Yasmin Levy) as part of the Athens-Epidaurus Festival 2015. What a setting, what acoustics! As the sun sets, the ancient theatre seems timeless, past and present unite, and just being there is a privilege and great pleasure. (You cannot help but wonder just who sat in the same seat as you almost 2,000 years ago ...) The staff are efficient. Cushions are provided on the ancient stone seating. (Standing and stretching at intervals recommended if you don't go for a quick stroll.)  A highlight of the fortnight in Athens. Safe also for the solo traveller.\n",

The theatre or odeon was built in the memory of Aspasia Annia Regilla, the deseased wife of Herodes Atticus. The same Herodes Atticus re-built the Kalimarmaro/Panathanaic Stadium. You can see inside the theater from above in the Acropolis just before you reach the Propylaia. Unlike many other occupiers of Athens the Romans actually added to the Acropolis instead of destroying it.since i seen a very famous Greek musician/maestro called yanni given is concert on this site i always wanted to go to see this magnificent theater ..and i may say that iam was very pleased to be there...it is wonderful place to see and very close to the Parthenon.. i payed 12 euros to go inside the acropolis and to be honest there is allot to see around..just one recommendation ..after you visit the acropolis dont trhougth away your ticket because with that ticket you can see more places in athens for free..as long you show the ticket from acropolis....one of the places is the zeus temple..\n",

If you're going to the Acropolis to see the other sites such as the Parthenon above, see those on top first as early as you can (before 9am) as it is busier up top then go down and see this site as it is not as popular. Part of the reason might be because it was roped off when we were there in early March, so you could not go inside it like the Theatre of Dionysos. The Acropolis gets much busier as it gets later in the morning and the bus tours arrive. Bring some water and a hat for when it gets hot. In stark contrast to the Theatre of Dionysos, this site is so well preserved and restored so beautifully. You see exactly how it looked in its prime and no imagination is required. It's definitely worth seeing if you have the time. If you have to choose which sites to see at the Acropolis I would see them in this order (most interesting to least) the Parthenon (up top), Erechtheion (up top) and this site tied for third with the Temple of Athena Nike (up top). You can get somewhat close to it for picture taking but we could not go in which I think is to help preserve it. It only takes few minutes to see so you don't need to spend too much time here. I heard it mentioned that there are sometimes concerts or performances here, I think one would be worth seeing here as I think the acoustics would be wonderful from being in other ancient amphitheatres.

The ruins of this theater were lit up in brilliant shades of purple and red and the haunting melody from behind the walls enthralled us. We returned the following night with tickets to a concert as part of the Athens Festical and this time beheld the charm of this monument from within. The building in its full glory would leave one speechless and we could imagine its elaborate ceiling with wood and fine details. The building itself is a labour of love and this word rings true when you can behold this beauty with an added touch of music or performance of some kind. In one word, sitting under the stars in this amphiteater and listening to a composition with whispers of the Greek myths in the air is simply ENCHANTING.\n",

We were fortunate to attend a concert here that featured a group headed by Italian pianist Ludovico Einaudi.  The music was neo-classical style, had a very pensive sound and just caused your thoughts to float and soar through time and space.  If you had commissioned someone to write a concert specifically for this theater, they could not have provided music that better suited it.  Having said that, if you are staying in Athens, I would strongly recommend trying to attend a concert of any kind just to experience being in this place. There was a chance of rain all evening, but it never occurred.  The sky was very dark and full of ragged white clouds that blew along behind and above the windows in the wall behind the stage, and this only added to the mystical feel of the place.\n",

Show up early and find a seat on the aisle because once it fills up it can get pretty tight if you are stuck in the middle. There are no seat backs and can become a little uncomfortable, also the bathrooms are located outside of the venue and only water is allowed in.

The Irodion is a fantastic setting - just beneath the Acropolis. The acoustics are very good, and the lighting uses the ancient structure to maximum effect. There are quite a lot of events there, ranging from classical and popular Greek music to ancient Greek plays. If you want to really get into the Athenian spirit, try to go to one of these concerts or plays, rather than just gazing down at it when on a trip up the Acropolis Because it's an ancient theatre, the seats tend to be uncomfortable - stone with a cushion on, but no back support.

Undaunted we bought tickets (not cheap!) for a musical event thinking that even if we did not understand Greek we could enjoy the music. \"Be here one hour before the show starts\" the ticket counter girl told us. We rushed dinner and arrived 45 minutes before the show. (Half an hour after the show started the Greeks were still coming in! I read that Greeks are usually fashionably late!) Although the sun was setting, its an open air theater, no air-con; so its still warm. There were cushions on the stone seats but as there are no backs to lean on, its still uncomfortable. You either sit upright, or slouch or lean back against the seats one row above, that is until someone else comes and take those seats.The songs were written in melancholic minor keys. Not only did we not understand the lyrics, the music itself was depressing. There were background dancers but alas I couldn't understand their artistic expression. I am sure many people enjoy this kind of musical performance and it is an art form that is well established. Actually i am glad I had experienced it. But I can't lie, I did not enjoy it. I am sorry my Greek friends. I must be the only one who did not enjoy this here but no offense I must be the barbarian. Beautiful setting though.\n",

It was built in 161 AD, and is rather well-preserved, but is often bypassed by tourists because of \"more interesting\" well-known nearby structures of Acropolis. I should say that an all-inclusive path through monuments of Acropolis is to start at the secondary entrance nearby the Acropolis Museum, to the south-east of Acropolis hill, to take a look at the monuments of both South-east and south-west slopes, and then to proceed further up to the Beule Gate and Propylea, the entrance to the Acropolis itself. That way is more quiet with less tourist crowds, and one can enjoy the walk in green areas, of course that´s if you have enough time for a visit, maybe 3 hours or so.\n",

The acoustics were wonderful and just the sense of being in a theater where 2000 years ago, Greeks were also listening to music made the experience unique.  The stairs are a bit steep and the rows close together but manageable. I was afraid the stone benches would be hard, but there are cushions to make it more comfortable.  For our experience, the audience was mostly Athenians, so that made it even more interesting.We had also seen the Odeum while hiking up to the Acropolis and it looked interesting then, but filled with people and music a magical experience.\n",

To calm the public perception and likely prosecution, he built this theater in her name to honor and mourn her.  Was he genuine in his innocence and sorrow?

Every  worthwhile artistic creation in these fields may be allowed to be presented on the ancient  monument's scene. The Odeon stands in the core of a small wood, of trees and shrubs.of the same kinds as those luxuriant in the ancient times..The pathways to and from the theater are themselves works of art, the stones and plaques have been carefully chosen,composed, designed and put in place by one of the most brilliant Hellenes of our time, the architect and landscape planner D. Pikionis, who picked the marble and other material plaques, that would pave the paths among the trees, from antique material, which in itself was of timeless if heteroclite pieces of stone that were in everyday use by the Athenians for a lengh of time in the  past and present..The atmosphere before each performance is celebratory,especially when the moon is hanging over and illuminates Acropolis and the Odeon. I have seen and heard there operas, Greek tragedies and comedies, concerts and orchestral performances, ballet theatre, and even the Beijing Opera-dancers'company, and countless other illustrious appearences that had been keenly discused by the Athenians and their guests, as well as by next day newspaper critics. In the big days, the president of the republic, the prime-minister and an echelon of the ruling class are sitted in the first central rows, in what should have been the archon basileus and the officiating Dionysos' priest's seats, but then at least some of these people of todays' excellence, have achieved a sort of semi-deity, e.g The Melina Mercury, a regular guest, when she lived, and many more international stars.They say that, when Luciano Pavarotti was to give a solo performance for some good cause, he insisted that all cicadas be removed from the small forest around the Odeon, or be made to silence, because they were an impediment to the full unfolding of his dear voice.I don't know if he got what he asked, but cicadas' accompaniment is a very plausible and harmonious musical comment to whatever is going on, in any performance in the open Herod Atticus Odeon.Recommended to anyone who appreciates good music and theatre, ballet etc, who may also have a curiosity to have an insider's view of the core of the small Athenian community, plus some of their leaders outside their television cadres...\n",

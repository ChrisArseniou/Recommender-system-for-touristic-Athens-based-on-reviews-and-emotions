Afterwards walk past the Parliament and see the guards in their traditional dress. If you time this right and are there around the hour you will see them do their strange walk!\n",

We did expect it to be warmer than Bucharest in December, but had none other expectations otherwise. It was nice to see the palm trees, the acanthus plants and of course, the noisy parakeets. Being out of season, it wasn't crowded, so we took a little time to explore the garden with the definite thought of coming back later, which we did. I don't think we actually saw everything there is to be seen, but it was fantastic. We did get a bit sad to see the enclosed animals (a few goats, a sheep, some rabbits and quite a lot of what looked like normal, common pigeons) who, although did not seem stressed by the tourists, appeared to be a bit out of place and not very happy. Would we recommend the National Garden? Yes, definitely. 5/5 because it's such a beautiful and surprising space to be in in the middle of December (especially because a few hours before, when we left Bucharest, it was snowing as we departed)\n",

There are signs that if you know the direction you are heading you can wander you way from one edge of the garden to the other. Just note that there are only a handful of exits. If you are in a hurry, this might not be the ideal but I was not and it was very easy to navigate. There are also maps for you to check, if needed, that you are going in the correct direction. Or you can double check with you GPS on your phone. It is so peaceful with lots of large trees, plants, and flowers. There is even a little zoo!There are ruins but if that is what you are coming to see, they are not much to check out. Very small and not too impressive! Picture included. There are tons of benches. Play areas for kids. Peaceful areas to chill. Something for everyone!!!!!!!One thing I did one to point out to anyone that is into Roman bath, because I feel a lot of people miss this, is if you are coming from Hadrian's Arch / Temple of Olympian Zeus and heading to the Parliament with the National Gardens to the right. There are baths located that you can see as you walk along the street. It is covered to protect it.\n",

It is a must not only when it's your first time to visit the city, but whenever you have time to make yourself the favour of relaxation and changing air. The garden will surprise you starting from the palmtrees twin to those of California beach. Passing by a collection of exuberant flowers, trees, grass and plants. Everybody enjoys watching the turtles, the ducks, crossing the bridge and feeding the goats (pasta & carrots) while they play with rabbits like a real Bambi. Don't miss watching the peacocks as well, they are behind the goats. There are also some lovely fountains where you will see beautiful doves and pigeons. The garden is a perfect place for meditation, yoga, excercising, walking, picnicking, reading, capturing photos, and simply just changing air midst nature while may be eating some grilled corn from the vendor outside. It goes without saying that the garden is children-friendly. However, you need to keep your eyes on them; in order not to fall in the pond or hurt themselves. The garden has a connecting door to the Zappeion palace, where you can enjoy an example of the exquisite architectural heritage of Athens, a view of the Acropolis, an amazing fountain and may be a coffee or a meal at the historical Aegli café nearby. Also, there is a connecting route to the Panathanaikos stadium, where the first modern Olympic Games took place and the famous statue of the discus thrower opposite to it. Make yourself a treat every now and then and visit the National Garden.\n",

We followed the sounds of happy children to find the playground, and we enjoyed the animal and bird area. There was also a turtle pond that was fun to see.

Throughout the gardens there are thought to be 7000 trees & 40000 shrubs of 519 species & varieties, 102 of them Greek.

Whilst the park is okay, it is no where near as nice as the parks I am used to in London. There is a small \"zoo\" but this didn't look too well maintained and the animals looked uncomfortable. The toilets had homeless people in there and there isn't a cafe in the parks (so bring drinks in with you). We then went to Zappeion Palace (which was really lovely to see from the outside and inside) and then we sat by the fountains. Unfortunately after a while of sitting here, I noticed a man in the bushes masturbating. I felt so uncomfortable and as soon as he saw me notice him, he stopped and ran away. After researching the reviews here left before me, I have noticed I am the fourth woman to have written a review where this has happened. It is so disgusting and again I am used to the beautiful London parks where no one has to worry about something like this! I tried not to let it ruin my visit to Zappeion Palace (which I think everyone should enjoy visiting). But unfortunately this seems to be a common problem in this park, which I doubt anyone in Athens is trying to solve. If you're male or with a man you'll feel a lot safer in this park, than a woman on here own or in a group of females.\n",

After i realised what was going on I chased one off and warned another girl there who reported having seen that happen a few minutes before as well. Came back the next day to see if this was a regular thing, and yes. I spoke to the police parked outside and they were clearly aware of the issue and felt sorry but said they couldn't do anything about it. There are people working out and families walking around and I think most people do not notice those mastrubating guys but I would certainly not recommend going there!\n",

It was warm and the odour was pungent. It is believed that the classical city of Athens exists beneath the grounds of the National Garden. The President’s residence is on the opposite side of the Garden from the city centre. The salvias are an incredible variation of the plant with its contorted shape and vibrant colour. We've seen it elsewhere in Athens along with millions of olive trees. I thought the olive seeds must have been distributed by birds and goats, especially those on the sides of enormous mountains but have been reassured that growers, even on mountains, planted every single tree across Greece. It was matter of earning a living in harsh conditions. Olive trees require little in the way of water and nurturing. The oldest olive tree on Crete is 3,000 years old and still producing olives.\n",

I haven't visited the café or the WC, so no opinion on those.I have visited the animals though (there are ducks, chickens, parrots, peacocks and other birds, goats, bunnies). It's so lovely to observe them as they play, eat or rest.In the past there were a lot more animals, but I think because the space isn't that large they reconsidered and only kept the animals which the space was appropriate for. Please avoid feeding the animals or trying to pet them.Apart from that, there are many lovely pathways, a few small lakes and overall extremely picturesque places. And of course, if you're into sharing nice pictures on social media, this place is extra instagrammable! Lastly, if you enter from one of the Syntagma gates you can get out of the gates closer to Zappeio or Kallimarmaro Stadium (definitely worth a visit as well).

The large park behind the Zappeio is probably more colourful at the right time of year, but mostly just green when we were there in October.  There’s not a lot to see — a labyrinth of paths wind around the park although it is annoying that so many of the gates are locked so there are limited ways in and out of the park. There are lots of benches, some playgrounds, and a weird little area of large bird cages with exotic birds next to a rocky enclosure for some goats, which may have been Kri Kri’s from Crete, and rabbits who may have just moved in.\n",

Unfortunately they reflect the economic situation in that they do not appear to be lovingly maintained (i.e. the animal enclosures are incredibly sad and I seriously wish they would re-house them somewhere better). I give the animal area 1 star. The two stars for the gardens comes because it is actually a relief to come in here out of the sun for a break to cool down. Come here for a bit of green space and shade in a very hot summer and a pleasant walk but that is about it. Not worth the time like a usual botanic garden in a city usual is. The cafe was not open so you won't be able to get anything to eat there but people were using the cafe's seats and took their own food and drinks.\n",

The center of the Garden has some animal pens and a small aviary.  Unfortunately they do not look very well maintained.  Things may have looked worse due to the heat (97F/35C) but in those conditions more care is needed.Birding was fun.  There are parrots all over, particularly near the animal pens.

The turtles had to sit on each other as there wasn't enough space on the rocks for each to sun themselves. The water was putrid. There's small enclosure with goats. There's no fresh water for them. No shade. No grass or trees. They looked so unhappy. Just a dirt and cement cage for them to rot in. Very upsetting to see so many locked away in such a small area. I don't understand why no one has provided them with fresh clean drinking water. Sure it's not that big of an ask.Birds looking stressed in small cages and more tormented animals.I can't believe this park is an a first world country. Greece should know this not acceptable.

Many plants and animals were brought in, but unfortunately the Greek climate and weather were not very kind to them. Today it still contains a number of very unusual plants and some animals and birds, although, admittedly not too many. It is a very lovely garden where visitors can take a stroll and enjoy some very quiet and peaceful time within its confines. There are even some archaeological objects within the Garden, like ancient Corinthian and Doric style columns. You just have to look for them by following the signs posted around the Garden. We certainly tried it and it was a bit of fun too. There is lots of seating and at least one pond. It is worth a visit if you can spare the time, and it is free.\n",

It is located directly behind the Greek Parliament Building (The Old Palace) and continues to the South towards the area where the Zappeion Hall is located. By the way, it has to be noted that the Zappeion was utilized as the Olympic village for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens and also as a venue for the fencing events. The Garden also encloses some ancient ruins, Corinthian capitals of columns, mosaics, and other features. This Garden was commissioned by Queen Amalia in 1838 and completed by 1840. It contains a very large variety of plants, trees, bushes and flowers, so in every season the visitors are gratified by its greenery and freshness. Even during Summer, when the temperature is quite high in Athens, it is possible to enjoy a bit of coolness, strolling around these nice Gardens.  People are utilizing this \"green lung\" of the City to do jogging, to walk or simply to relax, sitting down on one of the many benches, disseminated in the Park. This is an ideal place, for kids and families, as well. We like this Park very much and whenever we are downtown, we try to spend at least one hour, or more, around it and often we \"descover\" new little, secluded and nice corners. Definitely it is a place to be visited.\n",

      "Review text is :I arrived in Athens at 9:20 a.m. on a late June Monday, after a red eye flight from Toronto.First thing I needed to do was get a sim card for my unlocked phone. I had read on TripAdvisor that I could do this in the Departures Terminal at the airport, and the instructions worked like a dream. But, there was apparently a backup in activation--unless I could activate myself once I got to the hotel (I am technologically challenged), they suggested I go elsewhere.So, I took the X95 bus from the airport (another TripAdvisor tip--it is between doors 4 and 5 in the Arrivals terminal and costs 6 Euros, 3 for seniors) to the Hilton and was settled in my room just after noon. I then walked to Vodaphone amd got a sim card that was activated immediately and by them.Making progress, I had to find something to do to stay up until dark. It was too hot to climb Mt. Lycabettus.The National Gardens was next on my list. It was free and quite close by.I entered at the entrance just off Vassilis Sofia, a twenty minute walk from the Hilton.It would be a while before I found that entrance again--because for the first hour and a half, I was enjoying the gardens and for the second hour and a half, I was lost.There are seven entrances to the gardens. There are maps posted periodically to tell you where you are, but there are also many unlabeled paths, the maps are in Greek, and I did not find them at all helpful. I tried out my English, French and body language to get directions; almost everyone was glad to offer advice, but their tips  got me even more lost, until I eventually blundered out a different exit than I had come in.Make sure to take plenty of water with you when you embark on a visit to the National Gardens, in case what happened to me happens to you. Also, take a few salty snacks, especially if it is a really hot day.My initial impression of the gardens was, honestly, that it was a terrible mess.Nothing spectacular at the exit I came in, just some dusty paths, a dog wandering alone and lackluster bushes. If you are expecting a manicured botanical gardens, which I was, you will be very disappointed.But, though this garden is no longer well maintained, one can see vestiges of its former glory, once one probes a little deeper inside.And, the trees were shady, so that was the first plus.Inside the gardens, you will find many delights--a turtle pond, a misting fountain, many different species of flowers, exotic trees and plants that had been imported for the original garden (especially impressive is a large stand of Washingtonian Palms). a zoo with cages of birds, goats and other animals, a beautiful green lake with a wooden bridge crossing it, pieces of old statues and mosaic floors. There is even a yellow mansion on the side near the Acropolis.Although not what I had expected, this gardens was great for a walker and I wandered around, in a partially zombie-like state, as my body was not sure if it was day or night, for a good three hours before I found a way out.If you have limited time or if your stamina is not that great, try to get a map over the internet ahead of time (in English) and plan your itinerary. I reiterate, this gardens is VERY big.There is also apparently a very nice playground, though I did not see it.\n",

The peacocks were also in a tiny enclosure - two males without tail feathers and one female - alongside some very sorry looking chickens. We could not find any members of staff to report the neglect - it was clear that the animals had been locked up and left to get on with it.

Great for kids with a collection of small animals, birds, fish and even turtles. Also home to seemingly the whole population of Athens stray cats! A local charity tries their best to keep the population healthy and in check.It's not the most inspirational of gardens but it's certainly nice to get away from the grimy streets. Even the traffic noise fades somewhat while you're here. There's a snack bar (and also some more on the periphery of the park) and plenty of kiosks close by. Small kids' swing park.Pleasant enough in daylight hours - like most city parks around the world! Worth an hour of your time to relax from sightseeing or shopping in the area.

Then I got to the area where the animals were kept and what I saw left me feeling ill. The geese have deformed angel wings (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_wing) from a poor diet. In fact as I watched a local lady threw food over the fence to them. Something tells me this is the only sustenance these poor animals receive. Then I saw one duck or goose lying that looked like it was dying, with not a single park staff member to notice. The peacocks were in the tiniest of enclosures, there was no way they would have been able to spread their wings.Then the turtles. If the birds don't make you feel terrible then the turtles will. They are housed in a tiny, filthy pond... I would estimate around 50 all in this enclosure, so crowded they either had to swim in the disgusting water or climb all over each other.The worst thing is that there was not a single staff member around to complain to. Now I am going to look for somewhere online to send an email to, but I suspect that my complaints will fall on deaf ears. The Greek people don't care about the welfare of their animals, or it is at best terribly misguided. It makes me want to leave this city as soon as possible.\n",

While it offers a bit of respite from the manic traffic that surrounds it, you have to be on your guard to ensure you're not knocked over by the streams of cycle tourism groups racing at frankly silly speeds along the lanes. There are a couple of (kiosk-style) places selling a limited range of food. If you're visiting with kids, there are areas where there are groups of youths smoking jazz cigarettes too. My biggest problem with this place is the appalling treatment of the animals cooped up in a small area of the park. There is a small pool with scores upon scores of turtles (the ones around 20 to 30 cm long) - far too little space for far too many turtles. There is an enclosure with lot of waterfowl in but not a drop of water for them. There is an enclosure largely containing unguates, some of which are in urgent need to attention - very little water to drink and some of their hooves so long that they are all but lame.

Of the several entrances you can reach the adjacent  sites:  Zappion, Amalias-Constitution Square, Herodus Atticus (Presidential Palace), Queen Sophia (the Boulevard).  These neighbouring areas encapsulate or lead to the historic centre of the city. Small caffe along Herodus Atticus side entrance.   The Regiment of the Presidential Guards is stationed there guarding the Presidential Building and the Inknown Soldier's Monument in Constitution Square.\n",

There is a quaint zoo inside the gardens, and I confess I never visited.It is a lovely place to go through, bot not to stay in for two reasons, 1. it's a little bit thin in terms of restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops, book stores.2. Flashers: the first time I was there, with my family, I had a young man sitting opposite me and was about 7 meters far from me. three minutes later he actually exposed \"his burden\" to me to see. I was terrified at that time and I couldn't tell my family who saw me jumping out of my seat, and when I was asked to explain my conduct, i said it's a splinter in the bench. two years later, I had another flasher, this time he was closer, about 4 meters, and older. This time I told my father about this, and he suggested that I take my camera and photograph this man and \"his burden\" and complain to the guys that even with a 4X zoom I cannot get a good picture!Can I recommend it? yes, if you wanna have fun teasing a flasher!\n",

The mini zoo is fascinating (if a little bizarre).

Then, we sat down on a bench to rest and after a while noticed a man sitting on another bench staring. It made me slightly uncomfortable at first, but we continued with what we were doing. After a while, I looked back up, noticed him still staring and then realized he was masturbating. We immediately left that area and as we walked out, we saw another man doing the same. I'm not sure if this is common, but it was the middle of the day and there were plenty of people wandering around. We found the nearest exit and left.

There are huge tall caged in area that contain all kinds of birds, including peacocks. As you walk along you will discover a pond full of turtles. This is a wonderful place to bring your children and grandchildren. On a hot day in Athens, this is the perfect place to go to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Bring your camera and maybe some snacks for the a little picnic on the benches here and there. And for what it's worth, there is a clean public restroom in this park, something not available in the city. Set aside a couple hours to enjoy this natural treasure!\n",

The stranger was staring at us and committing an awful offence whilst doing so. We did not react to the situation as a Louis Theroux documentary had taught us that these 'tossers' 'get off' on the victims response. So walked away in a nonchalant manor. We found a policeman who was very helpful, and quite surprised, and then went on to visit more attractions such as Zeus' Temple and the Acropolis Museum. Both of which were very enjoyable.

An engaging temporary exhibition was underway, in addition to superb permanent works such as At the Bar and My Mother with the Silent Telephone.Eateries abound and we enjoyed tasty outings at Byzantino Restaurant and others. Not far from the former is the outstanding historic Monument of Lysikrates. Dating from the mid 330s BCE and built by the wealthy Athenian Lysicrates, a Choregos who financed music and dramas in the ancient theatre.     Grand Byzantine churches are plentiful, we particularly liked Agios Nicholas Rangavas Church with gorgeous stone work throughout. Another fine one on Kidathineon is the Church of the Metamorphosis (Kottakis) set in peaceful sylvan grounds.\n",

If you look from South to North, it is an inverted trapezoid, the base of which is Ermou street, which connects two important squares of Athens, where there are metro stations Monastiraki and Syntagma. If you go from Monastiraki, the first thing to do is to go around the perimeter of the Roman forum and take a photo. Go inside for 6 euros, I do not see the point. Everything is perfectly visible from the outside, especially since only 2 structures have been preserved: the Tower of the winds and the Gate of Athena Archegetis. The next important item is Adrianou street. There is no ancient heritage on it, but there are plenty of Souvenirs on this topic. Following the arc of Adrianou. it will lead You to a monument similar to the pedestal on which posters and ads were previously pasted. It is important for the history of architecture and monument of Lysicrates. This is the first known use of the Corinthian order. And by the way IV century. It is installed in honor of the victory of the Lysikrates choir in the creative festival in Athens. Plaka ended here, turn back and turn right in the direction of traffic. This is another important street of the Kydathinaion district. After walking 300 meters, you will see the Museum of Greek folk art. Five floors of the Museum are filled with rich collections of national costumes, household items, etc. This is a fashionable topic in historical science-the history of everyday life. Well, then you need to wander through the small streets of Plaka. This is the most pleasant thing here. Photos with views of the Acropolis and preserved paintings by George Savakis are very romantic...\n",

This beautiful neighborhood is filled with tourists and is lively all day being filled with taverns and shops Selling everything from olives, olive wood products, souvenirs and authentic Greek food. Nearly all corners and ally ways have something new to see. Be careful though, there are Gypsies and beggars nearly on every corner so I would recommend placing valuables in a safe back in the hotel and guarding belonging close to you. Some taxis also don’t drop directly within plaka since the roads are incredibly tight and it is nearly always busy there.  Just a note, for those using the taxis, if they refuse to drop you to the location you ask it is illegal and you could tell the police since all taxis drivers are obliged by law to drop you to your required destination (just a note since we were refused by a taxi driver and a local friend told us)\n",

It is the atmosphere you would enjoy. About buying souveniours, I suggest you visit a few shops to get an idea about the cost of something, before starting paying for them. You will find price differences of the same item from shop to shop. Another thing to mention - never accept an item (usually flowers) from a random person who claiming it as \"free\" gift.

It was and old old well, a hole in the ground with stones around it. We read the plaque on the door. It was the oldest house in athens  they said thousands of years old. It was by donation and we went in and spent a few hours in there. Tow floors. Two courtyards. One in the back where the family had an olives press, and one in the fronts where they had a wine press. The bedrooms were huge and airy. There was a beautiful old fireplace finished in whitewashed stone. Huge pottery urns delicately put together after centuries of being broken.  The bedroom ceiling was done in intricate wood lattice. It was the most beautiful part of the plaka district. The tapestry in the back courtyard told the story of like from long ago.

If you are careless you will definitely be robbed. The locals say it's Gypsies not Greeks doing the stealing. Nevertheless, it is exciting to stroll through the Plaka at night and soak up the atmosphere.  A visit to Athens is not complete without seeing the Plaka.\n",

We purchased beautiful leather sandals for $35euros...I wouldn’t spend a week in Athens however I think if you’re planning to come To Greece you must go for at least two days just to see the Acropolis /Parthenon ! It was so beautiful and so impressive but make sure you take a tour that lasts about 2 hours just so you could hear the history because if you don’t you’re just going to walk around and not know the history behind it and act like every other tourist taking meaningless photographs of columns ...  it’s a must see !

Found the variety of some quality items, such as musical instruments, to have had been good to buy here. There were some things we just did not see in other places that we were a little sorry we did not snatch up.  Frankly, while it is a touristy place it may have been a good place to bargain as the heat, rumours of closing major sites due to it, seemed to be keeping some tourists away this summer.

No matter how many tourist shops there are, no matter how popular and eventually crowded, especially during the high periods, Plaka was, is and will be the most historical, picturesque and versatile place just about the center of the capital of Greece.Apart from walking around, with the metro station Monastiraki to get there, you can visit any of its archaeological sites, the museums, the island like Anafiotica neighborhood, or just enjoy window -or original- shopping and relax at any of its numerous, cafes, bars, tavernas or more sophisticated restaurants.In Plaka there are the most old mansions of the city, counting back to  the era of King Otto, relics from classical antiquity and Byzantine small churches. This fact does not stop life to be vibrant during all day long and nearly all night long. It is also a place where you may enjoy live music, outdoor cinema, visit art galleries, or just stroll beneath the Parthenon and take relevant photos!My suggestion in order to fully enjoy Plaka is to set off from Monastiraki metro station and end up to Acropolis by feet since in most of the streets cars are prohibited and there are also numerous shopping and drinking/eating suggestions.\n",

Koukaki was such a real, raw presentation of Athens, while Plaka was a carefully curated spread of idyllic shops, restaurants, neat little streets, picturesque pavements, and of course, many, many tourists and touristy haunts. I give it five stars for scenic loveliness and three for authenticity, which brings us to an average of four. Plaka may be the oldest neighbourhood in Athens, but its standing as a classic tourist stop has transformed it into anything but a genuine Athenian neighbourhood, especially when compared to neighbourhoods in Athens brimming with everyday modern Grecian life. It's definitely worth a tumble through, and while Plaka restaurants are priced higher than others in humbler locales, some of them serve really great food, such as gods' restaurant and scholarhio.\n",

This is a known common occurrence in this area (as in a lot of European places,  but this is a review of Plaka in Attica) so tourists need to be aware and not carry too much cash, personal belongings etc and to not wave your phone around.  Women should wear backpacks/handbags in front of them. Becareful to not be distracted.   Overall, stay alert but make sure you enjoy the beauty of Attica and it's people.

There are a variety of food at different price range, choose one that suits you. Along the streets, you can see houses and shops of different period of architecture. These were pointed to us by our Walking Tour Guide, Alex, from Eureka Tours. One thing to note is to be very careful when shopping/walking there. Saw many people of foreign nationalities trying to offer you flowers even when you are walking, eating at the Tarverns. Do not give them a chance to strike a conversation with you, eg put a bracelet around your wrist, offer a gift to you. They work in groups and once come near, you may not just lose your time but also your property. Every greek , from hotel receptionist to taxibdrivers to train station masters whom we met warned us against theft, bulgary, worse drug junkies’ assualt when they knew we were going to this area.\n",

That said, it's pretty safe to wander.  There are many hotels to choose from so you can walk to good shopping and restaurants (tavernas).   Plaka is almost indistinguishable with Monastiraki, another neighborhood with more touristy shops and a large square near a metro stop.  Have a bit of caution on a crowded day with your valuables as you move into Monastiraki square.  It's safe but easy for valuables to disappear.  Adrianou street starts down in Monastiraki beyond the ancient Agora and continues up through Plaka.  It breaks up in the middle around some ancient ruins but this is a good street to use as a base for navigation.\n",

      "Review text is :Plaka is the central area of Athens. It is the perfect base for travelers to this ancient city. Situating yourself in Plaka will mean that you are able to access most of the main areas of Athens by foot and armed with a simple map.When you arrive you will see many areas of the city are heavily graffitied. It is a sign of the recession in Greece. Don’t let it deter you and just under the surface of what appears to be a city in struggle, the magic of the Plaka area will powerfully mesmerize you.One if the best parts of the Plaka experience is how the people live amongst the ancient ruins and the modern city springs from the old. Athens is in fact built on former ancient cities, parts of which have been excavated. You can walk over large parts of the old city when you visit the Acropolis museum which at the entry has an amazing glass floor. It is truly like stepping back in time.One end of the Plaka is near Monastiraki plaza. This is a whirling locus of colour, activity and vibrancy. Monastiraki area has fine restaurants, taverna, ice cream shops (a Greek speciality), jewelers, the Athens flea market which is full of antique shops and second stores (great for op shop addicts like me) and other places perfect for some gift shopping. There are several supermarkets in the area, so if you have Airbnd accommodation you can cook and eat in. Monastiraki is very close (15 minutes walk) to the Acropolis, the most famous archeological site in Greece. See my review on the Acropolis also posted on Trip Advisor. Monastiraki is right next to other keys archeological sites including the Roman Agora, Stoa of Attolas and Temple of Hephaestus. It is great to wander about Monastiraki plaza and do some shopping and have a meal. Do beware of pick pockets throughout Athens though, particular in the city squares and on the train metro. There are also scam artists who are giving out hand woven bracelets ostensibly for free. After they’ve tied one around your or your child’s wrist they will ask you for money and the situation becomes very awkward. I have written more about being safe in Athens on my blog. In my assessment, it is a safe place to travel, your greatest risk is getting pick pocketed, but do take care with your belongings (I write from personal experience).At the other end of Plaka you will be close to the famous Syntagma Square, the Greek Parliament, the splendid multi-level Benaki museum, the city gardens and the Olympic Stadium. With your map you can walk from one end of the Plaka to the other in about 30 minutes. Do use a map though as the many winding side streets look very similar and it’s easy to get lost! Also the footpaths are narrow and uneven because this is a very old city, so wear comfortable shoes. You can take a train from the airport to either Monastiraki station or Syntagma station. It’s very easy and tickets to and from the airport are dispensed from the ticket machines or ticket offices when they are open. Essentially, you can fly to Athens and see many key parts of it without a car.I have also written more about my impressions of the magical Plaka area on my blog.I have stayed at both ends of the Plaka in the Central Hotel and at the Athens Version. I have posted a review of Athens Version on Trip Advisor. Central Hotel is also an excellent, friendly place to stay. I stayed there a year ago so have not posted a new review, but I would give it four and a half stars for comfortable beds, cleanliness, safety and location. Our room and the bathroom was very small but it had a wonderful balcony. Anyone and every can visit the Plaka and it  is suitable for family travel.\n",

This is not just for tourists; the restaurants were crowded with locals as well. By the way, the Greeks in Athens are exceedingly friendly and courteous. Our taxi dropped  us at the bottom of three flights of outdoor stairs leading up to the restaurant at which we had reservations. (The driver wasn't aware that a side street went right by that restaurant, without the stairs). Anyway, we were struggling up those stairs, with restaurants on both sides. I was carrying my wife's walker, while she was making her way with a cane. Three young Greeks sitting at the adjacent restaurants leaped to their feet, one took charge of the walker, and the other two assisted my wife up the stairs. When we got ready to leave, after a splendid dinner, the restaurant staff were very solicitous about calling us a taxi and making sure we were in it safely We were impressed.  Such friendly, courteous people are rare in the US, our home country, but it's the rule in Greece to behave this way. We should copy them! Bravi!\n",

When in all other places in Greece you get a proper merida for more than half of that. Plus we paid a total of 176€ for food that would actually cost us about 60-70 max.

Would suggest that you don't pick up everything from the first shop you visit - because you will realise that as you go deeper into the streets - some of the shops sell stuff at a much lesser rate than others that are on the main road. The quality of the souvenirs is also better (personal preference) than the ones you get in Monastiraki square.I was with family and we had dinner in a lovely restaurant (can't remember the name, sorry!), right under a tree! The vibe was amazing and we enjoyed ourselves very much. Just walk around and choose a restaurant that suits your taste! Make sure you try out traditional Greek food - I'm a vegetarian and I fell in love with their veggie food.

During the day the narrow streets have a multitude of souvenir shops, jewellery shops, shops selling olive wood items, Greek foods and specialties with bars and restaurants on the wider side streets. Dotted around the are the ruins of ancient Athens which barely get a second glance from most people.  Most of the shops do not open until 10 am in the morning and when walked through Plaka early in the morning (in March) at 9 am the character of the place was completely different. With almost deserted streets and all the shutters closed the area feels very quaint, I would recommend visitors from the UK and western Europe to go for an early morning walk on the first day or two when they wake early because their body clock has not yet adjusted to the time difference in AthensIn March the streets were not very crowded but this had its' own hazards namely the cars and more frequently the motor bikes which dodge their way past the pedestrians\n",

Be prepared though to walk along uneven paths as there are ups and lows in the area. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes. Also bring a map of the area since it is like a labyrinth and you can easily lose your way through its alleys. All in all, Plaka is one place you should never miss when you visit the Greek capital. Very highly recommended!\n",

I have never ever felt unsafe in Plaka in the four times I've visited it over the last four years. Sure, you need to watch you wallet, but that goes the same for any tourist place you visit. There are lots of tourist oriented shops, the local people have to make their money somehow. Even though, you can still find one or two higher quality places that sell artisan Greek products if you do your research or look hard enough. There are also some streets, just off the main corridor, that look like time has left them untouched by tourism. I'll attach some photos to my review which show these beautiful areas that still felt authentically Greek to me. Personally, I love wandering around the cobblestone streets of Plaka. Look upwards in some of the streets and you get a nice sighting of the Acropolis.\n",

Plaka has old windy stone streets with lots of  cute shops to explore. We had a lovely authentic Greek meal up the steps towards the Acropolis in a charming restaurant that had a fire lit in a cute old white fireplace. (Beware there are a lot of smokers in Greece and no non smoking rooms in restaurants.) There were a lot of people out and about, a few artists performing on the streets and some street food vendors too.   It got dark around 5:15pm so the Christmas lights made the place sparkle.  It was bit chilly being late December so we were happy we had our winter jackets with us.   We had hired a driver with a van to pick us up at the airport and transfer us to the port because we are a family of 5 and taxi's here only take 4 people.  I realized at 7pm that I had misread the ferry departure time (it was in Military time.) Luckily our driver stayed in the area and rushed us to the port so we would make our departure by 8:00pm.  We made it with barely 10 minutes to spare!  Otherwise, we would have liked to spend more time in Plaka.\n",

There are of course some rare and authentic gems which I will review in other sections, but most of the shops sell basically China made Greek souvenirs. If you're looking for an authentic South-Eastern bazaar experience, head on down to Monastiraki (a 10 minute walk passing through Plaka) and get the same things half priced or less. In Monastiraki you will also find the flea market, old craftsman stores, funky eateries, great bars, etc. Long story short: Plaka for touristic comfort at extra expense, Monastiraki for authentic and much cheaper experience requiring a willingness to interact more with the locals.\n",

Wandering the streets of Plaka can take you most of the day as there is plenty to see and do.  Shops don't really get going until about lunch time but are open late at night.  At night the area is usually crowded but that simply adds to the atmosphere.  Try Daphne's restaurant for fine dining, Trattoria for mid-range Italian and Cafe Diogenes for the coldest beer in Athens.
